after arriving on file island, the seven children encountered digital monsters. it was a very strange island, where the phones they found weren't any bit useful. then, shellmon came and attacked them. upon doing so mon, evolve. ymon. the blue wolf. garurumon why did only agumon evolve into greymon back then. none of the others did agumon. what is it, taichi. why did you change back from greymon into agumon. well well. i don't know either. what's that. what is that. that's monochromon. but he's a really nice digimon, so there's no need to worry. an armored dragon digimon whose horn is as hard as diamond. he is normally docile, but when angered, he will fight his enemy to the bitter end. you say that, but he's heading towards us. no. there's another one. not good they've got us on both sides. run, guys. they're fighting each other. why. they must be fighting over territory. let's get out of here while we still can. let's go. wait, palmon. don't run ahead on your own. takeru. are you okay. you're fine, right takeru. yeah. i'm tired just a little farther, mimi. my calves will get fat. fatter legs are better, mimi. they can support your weight, and you can kick the dirt with them. i'm not like you. that's right. feet that look like plant roots are more beautiful. i don't like that either. the sunset has a very strange color. looks like the day is almost over. what should we do. it'll be dangerous to venture farther when it gets darker. i smell something. i smell it. the smell of fresh water. ahh, we've got drinking water. it's a lake. a lake. let's camp over there. i agree. i can't walk anymore. i'm gonna. hold it right there, gomamon. i think we've walked far enough today. everyone's tired and hungry. okay. we'll camp there tonight. wow, what a huge lake. this is the best place for camping. hey, does camping mean we have to sleep outdoors. looks like it. the lights came on. it's a trolley. what is it doing here. hey, maybe someone's inside. let's take a look. no one's here. yeah. it's still pretty new. these cushions are really comfy. but man, i don't get this first the phones at the beach, now this what's going on. you don't think this will start moving on its own, do you. of course not. for one thing, there're no tracks. this place will be comfortable to sleep in. but why don't we get food first. hey gomamon, don't get in the way. i can't catch any fish with you swimming there. lucky. these are my favorite. air shot. ow. i'm sorry. you don't need to use your powers just to get fruit. these mushrooms are safe to eat. not those. those are poisonous. that flower on your head isn't just for show, i see. of course not. okay, let's get ready to prepare dinner. but how can we light a fire. leave it to me. hey, you're useful, agumon. we've caught a lot. nice job, koushiro. you did great, takeru. you'll just ruin the fish that way. you have to cook it away from the flames. you sure know a lot about this, yamato. delish. takeru. what is it, oniichan. want me to take the bones out. just bite through the head and keep going. okay. sora. takeru calls yamato "oniichan," but those two have different last names, don't they. yeah. why. i don't know. what's wrong, senpai. i was trying to figure out which direction we're in, but i can't find the north star. you're right. i don't see any familiar constellations. that's odd you can only see the north star from the northern hemisphere, right. then could we be in the southern hemisphere. it can't be. i don't see the southern cross either. so what does that mean. sleepy, patamon. let's get ready for bed. perhaps we should take turns keeping watch. good idea. let's decide on an order. it's fine if the girls stay out of it. takeru doesn't need to either. i'm fine. don't worry about it. just sleep. but there's no bedding we can sleep in hey, gabumon. let me borrow your pelt to use as a blanket. i've been dying to see what you look like underneath that. let me see. anything but that. stop that. what are you doing. can't you see he doesn't like it. you didn't have to push me for that. stop it, you two. err, so then who will be our first lookout. i'll do it. i'm next. ookay. then, koushiro is third, and i'll be last. all right everyone, let's sleep in the trolley. i'm used to sleeping in a bed we should consider ourselves lucky we even found a place to sleep. good night. night. good night. i hope no monsters will appear before morning. i really wanted a bath. it'll be a long day spending all of tomorrow with everyone. i hope everything is back to normal when i wake up. gabumon. go to takeru. why. i'm sweating too much sitting next to you. oh, so you want to keep takeru warm. i never said that. that's because you're too shy. look who's talking. there's no point in keeping watch if you fall asleep. aw man, i want to sleep. i'll go wash my face. who's there. oh, yamato. it's too early to switch. i couldn't sleep. sorry about earlier. no, i'm sorry too i'm always like this maybe that's why takeru is more attached to you hey. what is takeru to you anyway. we're brothers. our parents divorced, so we're living separately. so that's it that's a nice tone. whoa, one of the embers popped. whwhat.. what's going on here.. it's an earthquake. trolley really did start to move. a monster came out. it's seadramon. a fiendish adult digimon who looks like a dragon. for its finishing move, it breathes out barbs of ice, ice arrow. really is an earthquake. the island is moving the island iit's moving. it's moving. it's like seadramon is pulling this island with him. this can't be. seadramon will never attack unless he feels threatened. it stopped. you two didn't do anything bad to him, did you.. we did nothing. nothing at all. that leaf thing was actually his tail. it is your fault. he's pissed. the island is drifting away. i'm feeling seasick takeru. wwait. my fur's going to get wet but here we go. we finally stopped. but now we can't escape anywhere. he's coming back. let's go, everyone. okay. magical fire. air shot. poison ivy. petit thunder. baby flame. agumon, evolve. i've been trying to, but i can't. why. i told you, i don't know either. man, you're useless when it really counts. hey, takeru. yamatokun. ooniichan. oniichan. takeru. takeru.. takeru oniichan. nice, gomamon. yamato, hurry. yamato it's seadramon. gomamon, take care of him. gotcha. hey. seadramon, over here. petit fire. gabumon. oniichan. it's because of me. it's because he saved me that he. yamato. bad. this is bad. now seadramon will never let go until he's squeezed the breath out of him. oniichan. patamon, please, save my brother. mmy powers won't work against seadramon. but gabumon, maybe you could it's impossible. i don't have that kind of power oniichan. yamato. i won't be able to listen to yamato play his harmonica anymore i won't be able to hear that gentle melody anymore yamato.. gabumon. gabumon, evolve. garurumon. oniichan, are you okay. don't worry about me. where's gabumon. garurumon's fur is as strong as the legendary metal, mythril. what is this legendary metal. since it's legendary, i've never seen it, so i don't know. an't tell whether tentomon really knows his stuff or not. that's seadramon's finishing attack, ice arrow. fox fire. he did it. gabumon. somehow it all worked out. if you could evolve, why didn't you do so in the first place. gabumon, thank you for saving us. nnot at all also, oniichan, thanks a lot. iit was nothing you're just too shy. look who's talking. but how do we get back to land. leave that to me. marching fishes. i'm so tired but why could only gabumon evolve this time. could it be because yamato was the one in trouble. chi. mon. chi.. what's that. last time, agumon evolved just when i was about to get it. so they probably evolve when great danger draws near us. that has to be it. what's wrong, mimichan. i'm going to sleep here. we've only spent a day here, and she's gotten stronger. she'll end up with a solid body like mine in no time. she might even grow wings like me. i don't want that thanks, oniichan an evil flame spurts from the well and dries up the lake. the one responsible for wildly burning up the forest, the village, and everything in its path is meramon. to save her partner sora, piyomon takes off. the bird of fire dances in the skies. next on digimon
