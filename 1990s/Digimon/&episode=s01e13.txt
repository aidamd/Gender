file island was broken into pieces. taichi and yamato, koushiro and mimi, sora and jyou, and takeru somehow managed to rise above their individual perils. but the final battle approaches angemon awakens. angemon awakens. kill the chosen children what's wrong. do you need to poop. takeru. look up. air shot. takeru, over here. okay. he's here. leomon is normally a good digimon. so if we can just take out the black gear in him i see but how. can you hear me, kid.. you're hiding somewhere like a scaredycat, aren't ya. come out quietly and show yourself. if you don't, this one here is gonna

rumor had begun to spread. it said that our world would be consumed with evil, and chosen children from another world will arrive to save it. file island now is indeed being overrun by the powers of darkness. that's when you appeared. so that's why you call us the chosen children. but you have no proof. the chosen children are said to have the power to enable digimon to evolve, just like you guys. if that's true then if we destroy the darkness, we'll end up being unnecessary in this world. what do you mean, koushirokun. in other words, we might be able to return to our own world. really.. but to do that you must destroy devimon, who is the source of that evil power. let's do it, guys. we can't survive here unless we beat him. you're right. besides, we have the power of the holy devices. i'll work hard. i'm scared but i want to go home. we'll help you, mimi. we've recovered our stamina too. i'm ready to fight any time you are. let's go to infinity mountain, yamato. yeah. we have no other choice. i will also assist you. great. it's decided then. it appears i'll have to fight them myself now before "he" appears. pplease give me another chance. yes, i'll let you fight as a part of me. death claw. come to me, oh powers of darkness. i'll turn this file island into your graves, chosen children. what's that. the powers of evil are gathering. what. the fight must be starting already. let's hurry. yeah. whwhat's that. whwhat is that.. is that devimon. why is he so big. could it be an illusion like the one he made earlier. no. he's grown larger using the powers of evil. he's coming. evolve, agumon. devimon. fools. you are all destined to die here. harpoon vulcan. you did it, ikkakumon. meteor wing. you guys. evolve now while you still can. agumon. let's go, everyone. agumon, evolve. greymon. go, greymon. gabumon, evolve. garurumon. i'm counting on you, garurumon. tentomon, evolve. kabuterimon. please, kabuterimon. palmon, evolve. togemon. you can do it, togemon. mega flame. fox fire. greymon. you think those attacks will work on me. mega blaster. chikuchiku bang bang. it's useless. no, togemon. kabuterimon. not so fast, leomon. what. you thought his back would be a weak point. well, i won't let'cha near him. i've become one with devimonsama. there's no way i can lose to you now. haouken. birdramon. struggling is futile. harpoon vulcan. ikkakumon. mega blas. kabuterimon. no way. no one can compete with him. the smallest chosen child. as long as you are gone, i have nothing else to fear. death claw. run, takeru. you worthless maggots. greymon ssorry, taichi i wanted to send you back to your world, but my power damn it. you guys tatakeru. air shot. air shot. air shot. it's no use. there's no way my attacks can work. why am i the only one. why can't i evolve.. patamon. takeru. takeru.. what's that. that's the light of evolution. patamon, evolve. angemon. anyone can run and give up nigetari akirameru koto wa daremo patamon evolved. angemon when given a second, so let's keep on walking instead isshun areba dekiru kara arukitsuzukeyou is that takeru's digimon. there's something only you can do kimi ni shika dekinai koto ga aru aoi hoshi ni he looks like an angel patamon evolved. so that this blue planet doesn't lose its light hikari ga nakusenu you ni damn you i was so close. i will obliterate your powers of evil. seize the dreams you painted. tsukame. egaita yume wo come to me, oh holy powers. protect your beloved friends. mamore. daiji na tomo wo then you can become stronger takumashii jibun ni nareru sa whwhat are you doing.. unknown power dwells in your heart shiranai pawaa ga yadoru gomamon. when its fire is lit haato ni hi ga tsuitara stop. if you do that, you won't get off that easily either. even your wishes, it's true, donna negai mo uso ja nai but there's no other way. will surely be granted, so kitto kanau kara even if this ends up destroying my body show me your brave heart show me your brave heart angemon. devimon. your evil powers have grown far too much. you must be erased from this world. i won't let'cha. scuse me. oh no. seize the brighter tomorrow. tsukame. mabushii asu wo protect the ones you love. mamore. ai suru hito wo angemon. then you can become stronger takumashii jibun ni nareru sa i'm sorry, takeru. i'll crush you to death. break down your weak self. kowase. yowaki na kimi wo heaven's knuckle. destroy the walls that block you. kuzuse. butsukaru kabe wo the passionate beat of your heart will be your weapon, so atsui kodou buki ni naru kara fool. that was foolish of you, angemon. believe in your heart believe in your heart what was the point in exhausting all of your energy here. the powers of darkness aren't spreading in file island alone. across the sea there are more digimon who have far greater powers of evil than i do. you guys are finished. angemon takeru. i'm sure we'll meet again. as long as you wish for it. angemon.. it's a digiegg. is it angemon's. angemon is starting over again as an egg. that's right. as long as he evolves properly, you'll meet him again. i'll take good care of you. look. the islands are coming back. the powers of evil that had devastated this island are gone. where's devimon. did they beat him. that's right. do you still want to fight. nno thank you. but he said that there are more powerful evil digimon over the ocean, didn't he. and i thought we could go back to our own world do we still have to fight. i don't want to. but we have to do it. no matter who our enemy is. what's that. well, well. you must be the chosen children. could this guy be. voices yagami taichi takenouchi sora ishida yamato izumi koushiro tachikawa mimi takaishi takeru kido jyou fujita toshiko mizutani yuko kazama yuuto tenjin umi maeda ai
