angelica. what are you doing." hi, daddy. don't i look pretty." ou mean you don't love me anymore, daddy." okeydoke." in the future, angel, daddy would appreciate if you didn't play with mommy's $95.00anounce oil of oleo vanishing cream, okay." well, vanishing cream... well, it's something that grownup people use to make things, uh... invisible." invistible. what kind of things." oh, unsightly liver spots, age marks, stuff like that." hmmm." that's probably drew. hope he's in the mood to lose." neurosis is the toughest game around. look, charles." hi, aunt didi." hello, angelica." hi, deed, chas. hey, brought some dessert for later. humble pie for stu, chocolate cream for the rest of us." that sounds lovely, drew. but before we start playing, charles and i found this dr. lipschitz quiz in child behavior monthly." really." oh boy, you'd think no one would need a quiz for that." look at you babies playing games in your little pen while the whole, big world passes you by. don't you even care what you're missing." oh, freedom. inderplendence. chocolate pie." it's over there. why don't you go get some." tommy, all the growedups are in there. we'll get in trouble." you know how the wind can move leaves around and push your ball and even blow houses over." well, have you ever seen the wind." i get it. if we use banishing cream, we could blow over houses, just like the wind." no, tommy. come on, i'll splain' it to you." 49: has the s.w.a.t. team responded to one of your child's temper tantrums in the past six months." number 50: has your youngster made at least two of the last three major purchasing decisions in your household." was that the last one." oh, don't worry, i marked four myself. and lipschitz says up to ten is perfectly normal." so, anyone up for a rousing game of neurosis." fortynine.." well, actually... uh... fortynine and a half." ah, what's a little magazine quiz, anyway." i mean, is it spoiling a child to buy her a few new toys every day. or to let her use my armandi ties as jump ropes. or to make chocolate chip pancakes for dinner a few nights a week. huh." yes. according to lipschitz, spoiled children crave attention for their negative behavior." that's right. all you have to do is stop reinforcing it. then the child will rechannel his or her energy to more positive modes of expression." which one is the banishing cream." now come on, let's go." okay, you're invistible. now go get that pie." who said that." no, he's not. i can still see him." look, go do something and i'll tell you if i can see you." whoa." hey, where are you guys." this is too great. i can't watch. yes, i can. ha ha ha." player number one can only move counterclockwise when all other players are frozen behind the penalty line." these are the most complicated rules i ever heard. go back to the part about scoring in reverse alphabetical order." how'd they do that." they didn't see you at all. of course not. we're invistible." okay, you don't need to be invistible anymore." put the rest of this banishing cream on me. i got a few invistible things to do myself." use it all. i wanna be really invistible." great. come on, cynthia." uh, angelica, i can still see you." well, i am a grownup compared to you." oh." what the." ah ah ah, drew. don't reinforce. remember dr. lipschitz.' hey, you're not supposed to take a relapse chip until you've gotten a marker into the home square." uhhuh." did you see." there's something very weird going on here." stu, honey, have you seen my glasses." why, no, dear. wherever could they be." oh, my. here they are. i found them." what." my carrot juice." why don't i serve that pie now." hmmm." they can't hear me, neither. i was laughin' and laughin' and they didn't even notice." i'm invistible. i'm invistible. nyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyah." know what, daddy. you didn't lose your office papers, i threw them out the car window on the freeway, cause' you made me eat broccoli. isn't that funny." oh." 30 points for me." did you see that. i can do anything i want, cause' i'm invistible. and i'll never get in any trouble for it." i wonder if a little girl named angelica took the pie." i guess the rest of us will just have to have cookies instead." aunt didi, i get a cookie, too, right." here you are, boys. enjoy." aunt didi. i don't want to be invistible anymore. can't you see me now." aunt didi, where's my cookie." hmmm. i thought i heard a little voice. but i guess it was just the wind." angelica, if you don't want to be invistible anymore, why don't you just wipe the cream off." for once, you babies got a good idea." it won't come off." oh, no. what if i stay invistible for the rest of my life." i can't believe she threw out the olsen report. it was a multimillion dollar account." drew, lipschitz says..." i just wish i could tell my daddy that i love him, and that i didn't mean to make him mad," and that he's the best daddy in the whole, wide world, and... and..." oh, poor sweetheart. you have learned your lesson." i want a sundae with chocolate sauce and marshmallows and peanuts and candy sprinkles." a rocco mr. x exploding smashup doll. a beverly hills cynthia lunch box. the complete samurai lizard action set. a commander buildyourown water slide center. a pony." ) )
