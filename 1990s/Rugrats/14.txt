stu's workshop. in his welder's suit, stu is busy welding something together. he flips the switches on a machine, turns the crank, and bolts of lightning strike what's under the blanket. stu turns off the machine, and a fullyarticulated hand moves.) stu:  yes. yes. it's alive. it's alive.  didi: what's alive, stu. stu: only the invention that's gonna... didi: "put pickles toys on the map". stu: okay, he's not alive, strictly speaking, but he's almost alive.  he's got fullyarticulated limbs,  a heatandmotion sensor for tracking potential playmates,  and a voice chip containing 217 different randomlyaccessed phrases.  didi, meet mr. friend.  mr. friend:  oh, boy, a brand new friend to meet. let's wash our hands before we eat.  stu: great, isn't he. didi: he's so... stu: "educational". didi: that wasn't exactly the word i had in mind.  mr. friend: hey, little pal, it's time to play. we're gonna have a happy day. stu: oh, boy, this is great.  i'm can't wait to show tommy.  chuckie:

come on, play with him all you want.  well, play, play.  aww, the phone.  now, don't play 'til i get back, okay. chuckie:  tommy... do you know this guy. tommy: uhuh, but my daddy says his name was "mr. fiend."  tommy: hi mr. fiend. i'm tommy, and this is my pal chuckie.  wanna play with us.  mr. friend: you can call me mr. friend. you'll never ever be bored again.  chuckie:  is he... is he broken. tommy: yeah... i think so...  mr. friend: hello kiddies, rise and shine. i'm your friend, dddd...  chuckie:  is it over. tommy: uh... uhhuh. chuckie:  what do we do now. tommy: do you have to ask.  didi: oh, dear. what's the matter. stu: i know, they think there's something wrong with their little friend.  the batteries came loose, that's all.  see kids. he's okay. mr. friend: a word of caution, if you please: don't kiss the cat when it has fleas.  stu: ok, i'll hire a writer to come up with some new lines.  gotta fix the latch on this battery compartment. might be some other bugs inside...  stu:  don't worry, champ. mr. friend will be just fine.  chuckie: whew... i'm sure glad we've seen the last of that guy. tommy: i don't know about that, chuckie. i just don't know...  didi:

what's the matter, tommy. come on, we'll get you a bottle.   phil: i dunno. he doesn't look so scary to me. lil: yeah, he looks kinda funny. tommy:  i'm telling you, that guy is nuts. he talks all night, and he smells like burning rubber bands, and worst of all, my dad says he's full of bugs. phil and lil:  bugs.  phil: i saw him first, lillian. lil: no, i did, phillip. mr. friend: mr. friend says, "please be fair. no one gets hurt when you share..."  mr. friend: eheheheheheher.  phil: you were right, tommy. lil: i never sawed such a scary toy. chuckie: what are we gonna do. tommy: we gotta get rid of him. we're gonna put him someplace where he'll never come back.  tommy: we put mr. fiend in here. that's the dirty clothes place. you put things in there when you want 'em to go away.  stu: i'm tellin' ya', deed, i can produce the first line of mr. friend dolls right here in my own workshop. hehheh. stu pickles isn't selling out any huge, greedy, toymanufacturing monolith...not yet, anyway. didi:  that's nice, dear.  mr. friend: here i am, don't be blue. and i will sing a song for you.  didi: how did you get in here.  please, i'm begging you, stu, hire a writer.  chuckie: know what, tommy. i don't think mr. fiend was really so scary. i mean, he was just a dumb old doll, right.  it's not like he...  tommy, chuckie, phil, lil: mr. fiend.  tommy: we're trapped. chuckie: what are we gonna do.  lil: no. not rhonda rags. phil: sorry, lil.  lil: phil, how could you.  tommy: don't cry, lil. he stopped moving again. lil: oh, phillip. tommy: i think rhonda's safe.  see. he wouldn't hurt another doll.  chuckie: hey, i got an idea. i saw this movie, king krong  where they got rid of a monster by pushing him off the entire state  building.  phil: so. chuckie: we just gotta push mr. fiend off the entire state building.  never mind.  i don't know why i even try. tommy:  wait a minute, chuckie, that's a great idea. chuckie: it is. tommy: sure, it is, it's gonna work perfectly. only, i think we should do one thing different: instead of pushing mr. fiend off a building, we'll bury him underground. phil: good thinking, chuckie. lil: yeah, way to go.   tommy: there, he's buried. chuckie: shouldn't somebody say a few words. phil: like what. chuckie: how 'bout... "hinkle finkle dinkle doo". phil and lil: ahem. chuckie: yeah.   stu: you guys look terrific. mr. friend's whole friendly family ready and rearing to go. i just can't wait to see you all in action at once.  mr. friends: hey little pal, it's time to play. oh boy, a brand new friend to meet... we're going to have a happy day. hello kiddies, rise anda shine. i'm your friend, and you are mine. hey little pal, it's time to play...   stu: uhoh.  hmm, still a few kinks to work out. ah, maybe i should take a little break...  mr. friends: here's advice that can't be beat: look both ways before crossing the street. hey little pal, it's time to play. we're going to have a...  mr. friend: stay away from squiggly worms, they're full of dirt and yucky gerrrrrrrrgerer, germs.  lil: now now, it's okay, rhonda. that mr. fiend's all gone...  ih. aaaaaaaaaaaaah.  phil: aah. mr. friend: obey your parents, stay out of danger, take daily naps, don't talk to strangers... chuckie: tommy. tommy: yeah chuckie. chuckie: i think mr. fiend is gonna be with us for a very, very long time.  tommy: wait a minute. we can't spend our whole lives running away from a dumb old doll. phil and lil: why not. mr. friend: hurhurhur... gerrrrrrrrgeer gerer...  tommy: causs, cause... then we'll never have time to do anything else, like play or take naps or grow up and get jobs. chuckie: that's okay with me as long as mr. fiend doesn't catch us. tommy: no, we gotta make him go away. you guys remember where that loose board in the fence is. phil and lil: yeah. tommy: then follow me.   mr. friend: geer, gerer, gerer... tommy:  okay, mr. fiend. come and get me.  you guys know what to do. phil: sure, tommy. lil: right behind ya. mr. friend:  let's all think of happy, happy, haphap gerrrrrrrrgerer, let's play a game of hideandseek. my turn to hide, but don't you peek.  mr. friend: do your homework, study hard, and don't eat food that's cooked in lard. contrary to what you see... tommy, phil and lil:  whew. chuckie:  you know, it's funny. i almost felt sorry for him just then. phil: yeah... but i'm sure glad he's gone. lil: me too. i hope i never see another toy like that again.   tommy: now that mr. fiend is gone, what do you guys wanna do.  lil: boy, this is really one of those days, huh.  chuckie:  what are we gonna do tommy, what are we gonna do.. tommy: what we should've done a long time ago.  guys, i'm done being "ascared." it's them or us. come on.  phil: yeah.  stu: deed, once i get all the mr. friend dolls up and running, i'll try 'em out on the kids and then...  ahhhhhhh. what happened..  my creations. my beautiful creations. didi:  now, stu, maybe the world wasn't ready for mr. friend yet. now let's go inside and you can figure out a new toy.  tommy: well, guys, we did it. we proved we're tougher than any toy. phil: i'm just glad it's all over.  angelica:  hey, babies.  guess what. when my daddy and me were coming over here, i found the neatest, greatest, bestest toy in the whole world. look.  mr. friend: let's all think of happy things. and laugh, and skip, and dance, and sing. angelica:  well, i thought it was neat.  the end ) )
