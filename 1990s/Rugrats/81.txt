uh, i was just making a flyer for a lost brownie. i swear. don't tell me. you think there's a pares to what the school chefs serve. like, that's how you communicate with fellow aliens.  brownie, with blue cheese and sour balls. tell me i'm not on to something. and, who are you. lil'q. i'm a transfer student. oh yeah. from where. um, from pretty far away. really. far, far away. at last. when i least expected, you'e made contact with me. me. you have the classic characteristics. the hyperextended index finger. the giant forehead. the exoskeleton. wait a minute. you don't have any of those things. that's because i'm not an alien. oh, sorry. so, you're just your basic trustworthy new kid in school, huh. um, yeah. oh,  and a hackysacker. cool. can you teach me to do that. but with a piano. sorry, it's just something you're... you're just born with. that's... weird.  right. valentine's day, and the school dance. once cupid's arrow pierces your heart, or shoulder, or any of the major extraminities really, the first person you see,  is the person you'll love, for all eternity. even if he doesn't love you back.   you could water the football field with that drool, girlfriend. you better not have any ideas about going to the dance with sean. he's mine. dude, do i look better sitting like this.  or like this.  aww, say it isn't so. valentine's dance. i'm ten. who needs this kind of pressure. it's hard enough handing out the cards. what do you say we just make it a... guys there for the free eats kind of thing. i'm with you, tommy. though at eleven, when it comes to social maturity, i am still at the bottom of the escalator. so, it's you and me. me and you. solid.  besides, girls are the last thing on my mimimi eieihi, nicole. hi, chuckie.  chuckie. nothiwhat were we talking about.  so, you're a tag team hackysacker, presently without a team, because your aim is lame. makes sense. i just gotta work on target practice. happens every february. wow. that's what i thought about verbs. ah, i don't get valentine's day.  this isn't even how a real heart is shaped.  you're getting cheese sauce on it.  and as third in charge of the dance decorating commitee, no sauce is allowed on any decoration without my sayso. sorry. so, it might be safe to assume you'd like to go to the dance with me and the chuck man. i don't have to buy you guys corsages, do i.  good one, huh chuckie. huh. oh uh, yeah. um, tommy, i've been kinda thinkin', and i'm, well, uh, what i mean is, um, it seems...don't get mad, but i'm thinking about asking nicole to the dance. what.. but we has a deal. i know. but ii feel like i've had an emotional growth spurt since then. since five minutes ago. kind of. she gave me a nice "hello."i think she's finally over that unfortunate chongo incident, and sees me as a worthwhile human being. fine. i'll just watch phil play "see food" all night.  okay, i won't ask her. i promised you we'd go as guys. uh, together. no chuckie, that's dumb. you should go for it. really.thanks, t. what's the worst that could happen. nicole could get a cramp in her side from laughing so hard before shooting you down you're going, right angelica. only with the most popular boy in school. morris inskeep. the kid who can peel the dead skin off his feet in one yank. eww. that's gross, even for you.  i'm talking about sean butler. whoa. he asked you. yes. he... just doesn't know it yet.  what's with ms. meaning this and chuck man about nicole.  dunno. hey, are you going to eat your carrot and red licorice salad.  copy a whitelib, dil.   now, when i tell you to beg me to go to the dance with you, use those lines i gave you. but i already told you, i can't go with anyone. i'm djing, and... beg.  please, oh please, won't you... please go to the dance... with me, angelica.  get down on bended knee, and... not that part.  you're the fifth boy who's asked me, and for the fifth time, no. i'm waiting for the perfect guy.  one who's as goodlooking and popular as i, but who could it be.. ohhh.   yo. hmm. you're messing up the game.   is it me, or is that kinda pathetic. pretty bold walk. i've seen worse oh haha, that was angelica, too. i'm glad i'm not bitten about the dance. me too. uh, we are going as a group, right. all for one, one for all.   i gotta say, i'm a little bummed about chuckie asking nicole. i mean, it was supposed to be a "who cares about valentine's day." night. okay, this is going to sound... pretty uncool, but i'm kinda hoping she turns him down.  did you hear that.   last chance to change your mind. nope, i'm gonna do this, tommy. um, am i sweaty. braces broccolifree.  how's my breath.  what're you so nervous for. you talk to nicole all the time. yeah, well, words come easy when you're not asking someone out on your first date.  okay, here i go.  break a leg.  you know, i need a real challenge. like, kicking it to the book that girl's holding.   uh chuckie, when i said break a leg,  i didn't mean, you know, break a leg.   minor setback. not a problem.  um, nicole....  tommy pickles.  you are the cutest boy in school. okay, that's a problem. dang.  tommy, walk me to my locker. well, ii uh, i ccan't. i gotta see a guy uh, about a thing. okay.  see you later. what's going on with her. i was going to ask you the same thing.  she sure acts like she likes you.  i've gotta hit her again.  you know uh, to be polite.    so, i've been comparing notes on what it's like to be so popular, people actually hate you.   dang. yo. what was....  susie.  who are you going to the dance with. do you wanna go with me. do you wanna go steady. i'm not being too pushy, am i. no, no, no, and yes. tight. a definite maybe. you want to takesusieto the dance..susie.. yeah, she's great. and i never knew it until just now, angela. it'sangelica.don't move.you stole sean from me, you, you, sean stealer. did not, i was sitting here, minding my own business. more like you were minding mine. ooh. ... ough. oh man. so, there's points off for hitting a sean, instead of a nicole. oh yeah. and i thought the rule of thumb was complicated. so, you're sure you're not forgetting about a time you saved her life, or somethin', or bought her a dessert, or a new car.. no. well, you had to do something to make her suddenly like you so much. i didn't, chuckie. i swear. besides, i wouldn't do that to you. she's probably just being polite. i know she likes you way more than me.  really. you think.  i've been looking for you.   happy valentine's day.  thanks. and it isn't even valentine's day yet. eexcept in mexico, i guess. i give the really special ones early.  oh, hi chuckie.   you get the special one.   man, i am totally sorry. this is like aa really bad afterschool special. ii want to do something to help, but i don't know what. i think you've done enough.  but... i'm thinking the school environment may be cramping your style. you're more of an outside the box type.  and in light of your recent mishaps, perhaps you should work your way up to humans, with some stationary egobuilding targets.   i'll uh, go order the smoothies.   kimi, if you know what's good for you, you'll keep susie the boyswiper away from z.  ooh yeah, 'cause i'm bored with sean, who i stole just yesterday.  a: susie is like my best friend. and b: z is just a good bud. thanks for the alphabet lesson, but i still say you can't trust her. right. watch and learn. susie, want to help z carry the smoothies back to the table. if you think you can trust me.  i thought you might need help.  susie, susie, susie. huh.  oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  susie, there you are.  i got it covered, so buzz off. oh yeah. well, i'm taking her to the dance. i'm taking her. z, we were going as a group. you, me, and kimi. remember.  kimi. heh, kimi who.  kimi who.. i'm taking susie to the dance. i'm taking her.  you're not supposed to be taking anyone.  you're not supposed to care. i don't. ii mean, i didn't.  okay, i do.  name your corsage. my uncle runs a limo company. i can get us box seats to the opera.  if uh, you know, that's where we're going. i don't know what's going on. best friends.. ha.  kimi, wait.  susie, wait. hold on.  susie.   okay, there's no point in working your slow twitch muscles, since targets will probably be moving. so, we'll focus on your fast twitch ones, enhancing muscle memory. i'm gonna run, you're gonna throw. thanks dil, but my mojo's a nogo. they give me one week a year, to show my stuff, and i blew it. maybe i better hand in the hackysacks.  pickles residence.  oh, uh, hi.  porkchops... homework... tv... bye.  was someone taking a survey. kind of. it was a girl, but she's madly in love with me or something. shshe may go ballistic. ' mm. the pickles curse. i mean, chuckie's the one who likes her. uh huh. he's the one who wants to take her to the dance. ah. only, he never got a chance to ask her. maybe, once she finds out he wants to take her to the dance, she won't be interested in me.  hey, thanks for your help.  i don't know what we said, but i'm glad we said it. anyone know what's with spike's sudden interest in the vaccum's funishe line attachment. uh, kimi. i just wanted to tell you, the same thing that is going on with you, susie, and z is going on with me, tommy, and nicole, so i know what you're feeling. oh, really. you suddenly realized you have a crush on z too, and your best friend is a backstabber. not exactly. the difference is, i've given this a lot of thought, and i'll be darned if i'm going to let this ruin my friendship with tommy. if he swears he didn't do anything to make nicole fall madly in love with him, and reduce me to a grain of sand on the beach of life, then... i believe him. he even told me to ask her to the dance. oh yeah. well, i heard him say he was hoping nicole would turn you down.  what. no way, tommy would never do anything like that.  that's what i thought about susie.  nicole.  uh huh. uh, what would you say if some guy whowho's really nice, but kinda shy  wanted to take you to the dance.  i'd love to go to the dance with you, tommy.  what.. oh, it's so cute when a boy makes up a fake boy just to test the waters.  no, no. oh, i can't wait to tell everyone.  tommy's taking me to the dance.  tommy's taking me to the dance.  chuckie, you've gotta believe me. uhuh she got it all wrong. ii don't want to take her to the dance.  tommy, how could you lie to me. i'm not. itit's all a mistake. suuure. the only mistake i can see is the one i've been making for about the last nine years, you know. thinking you were my best friend.  but it's not what it looked like.  dang.  like i said, we can't go to the dance together, nicole.  but you'll be there, and i'll be there, so we will be going together. you're so cute when you're confused.   you heard me tell her no, right. yep. then how come she didn't hear it.  sean is the perfect guy for me, and you know it. we are totally alike. well, he does stare at himself in the mirror as much as you do. so, you'll tell him you're not interested. i'm not interested. in him, or z. and i told them so. i wish they'd both just leave me alone. boy, you tell them no, and they come back for more.  hey. maybe sean's the kind of guy who likes rejection. my specialty. thanks, ms. nolongeranitemwithsean.  phew, i finally lost them at the book store. hey, susie. is it me, chuckie, or does valentine's day make people a little nuts. it's like kimi and i were never friends. d'aah.how can you say that. well, if we were, she would've believed me when i told her i didn't have anything to do with z liking me. well, yeah, but sometimes, the evidence is just so... i mean, isn't that the point of being best friends. you trust each other, even when everything is telling you not to. that's not crazy, is it. no.not crazy.not crazy at all. chuckie, you want to go to the dance with me. uh...okay. but just as guys, right.  susie really said that.   and i cut her out of a picture of us last night.  well, we can start taking new pictures. right now.   i arranged these in an ancient aztec symbol, denoting friendship. take one, and it'll say something totally different, like "cover your mouth before coughing." how valentine's day is that.  you're gonna get it right this time. i feel it. and when dil pickles feels something, it's not gas or indigestion. you don't need training. you need untraining. just let it go, lil'q, and be one with your muse.  let it go.  look, chuckie... nope, my turn ro talk. but my confidence tablecloth has been yanked out from under me, because nicole doesn't like me the way she likes you.  you're still my best friend.  and if you tell me you don't know what's going on, i believe you.  i'm so afraid sean butler is going to ask me to dance, and i can't stand him.what.. no, i don't need more longdistance minutes. huh.  hey, you are here with harold and his hiller hits. time to kick things up, so grab a partner.  don't think so.  go work that finster magic, chuckie, and ask her to dance.  we got ourselves an incoming.  let it go.   chuckie. yeah, i know, the last guy you want to see, but... would you like.... to dance. love to.  boy, i'll never get this game. you don't have to. and that "let it go" thing really worked. i'm back.   hey. boot girl, want to dance. but, i thought you...    oh. man, what was that.  hey angelica, did you see what. i'd love to. whoa. but i don't wanna dance. okay.  i just want to make one more shot.   that wasn't supposed to happen yet.  hey, could you ask my sister to dance, so i could eat.  whoa. lil'q. if this isn't rhuba...  dil, thanks for the pointer. lil'q.  oh.  if only you were cupid's arrow. ) )
