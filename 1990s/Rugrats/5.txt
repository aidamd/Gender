say, do you know anything about... dog food." listen up, dummy. this may be your birthday, but when the presents are open, i get first dibs on the toys. what about dog food." tommy thinks if you eat some, maybe you turn into a dog." you mean i could wear a collar with spikes on it." and chase cats." and howl at the moon." could i even bite the mailman." let's do it." yeah, let's get some dog food." that is one hefty hunk of health food." puppets, puppets, puppets. where are those puppets." stay cool, deed." betty, my future as a mother depends on this party, and the party depends on the

cries or something." i've heard about those things." only this one employs the latest technology. you can even talk back to the baby handsfree." wow. can i see it." squadron leader, this is concrete cowboy, do you copy, over." uh, that's a big tenfour, cowboy. i copy you loud and clear. say, this is kind of nifty." listen, let's take em' out back, and see what these things can really do." and
