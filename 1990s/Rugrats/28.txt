stay inside because of this stupid rain. maybe we should find a nice game to play inside. like what. you wanna eat the rest of my crayons.. how about "hide and go peek". that game's too scary. you have to be all by yourself when everybody hides. yeah, it's a stupid ga..... wait a minute. scary huh. yes i think "hide and go seek" is exactly the right game, and i'll figure out whose going to be the first "it"..... now up against the wall.  eenie meenie miney mo. catch a tiger by the toe. if he hollers, let him go. eeny meeny miney mo .... and my mother says to pick the very best one and you are not, not, not, "it" . huh.. well whatta you know. you're it, chuckie. i don't wanna be it.  it was your idea to play this game. o.k. i'm counting.... wait a minute, you could still see us. take off your eyes and turn around. my eyes. but i can't take 'em off. then you don't get to play with us. c'mon, chuckie. it's just your extra eyes. okay, okay, but only while i'm counting 'cause i don't

can't just disappear. we gotta keep lookin'. ow ohh ow. here. you babies can have these.  ehh ehh ehh. spike, it's raining. hey, we're outside, aren't we, spike. we're not supposed to be outside. spike, i don't think you're trying very hard to find tommy. if you're not gonna help me, i'm just gonna have to go and find him myself. tommy, phil, lil, there you are. you guys won't believe what happened.  remember when i took off my eyes to count to ten. well, i couldn't see and then things got scary of course, and there were monsters......... but, tommy, all we have are his eyes. how are we ever gonna find him. yeah, tommy. i didn't think hide and go peek was this hard. wait a minute. we got chuckie's eyes, right. yeah. well, maybe if we wear chuckie's eyes, we'll be able to see the rest of him too.. wow, this must be what chuckie sees. no wonder he's so scared. so then i bumped right into a soft thing with four legs and guess who it was. spike. yeah. isn't that great. tommy. phil. lil. don't you think that's great.  tommy. i think you need a new diaper.  waaa. you're not tommy. it's no use. i'll never find anyone without my eyes. . do you see him yet. i think so.  i don't see him. of course not. you don't have the right eyes. hey, chuckie. come down. it's us. tommy, uh, that's a bag of regables. it is. i gotta find my eyes. i gotta find my eyes. . oh... oh no. my eyes. .

these on. my eyes. i can see. me too. i thought they were broked. i stepped on them and made them go crunch. how do you see with those eyes anyway. when i putted them on i thought you were a bag chuckie... of vegables. i thought you were a bush. those eyes made me feel real dizzy, like when you spin around in circles. like this. . yeah. they make you feel kinda like throwing up. yeah, i think i know what you mean. i wonder why they didn't make angelica sick. oh. owwww. honey, you look a little sick.  oh, no. all over my new sweater. oh, come on. let's clean this up. hey, chuckie. yeah. if angelica had your eyes on the whole time, then what were these eyes you stepped and broke. darn ow o... now where in tarnation did i put my specs.  oh, didi, have you seen my glasses. ) )
