some parts of tomorrow's episode." i can't believe my grandpa's really leaving." whoa." ha, gotcha." here's what you missed if you weren't watching last time. i was singing my blandnew pretty song," and those dumb babies was all excited about fall until uncle stu's machine threw apples everywhere," and a giant reptar esploded in tommy's house," and made grandpa lou so mad, he moved away to live with all the other old peoples." then the deville kids gots new puffy diapers," and mr. chuckie's dad couldn't paints haycorn with finster," cause he was having dates with a bunch of ladies whose mommies looked desparate," now the babies aren't ecited about fall no more." but i still sing pretty." hey, hey, hey, hey. easy does it now, boys. that chair's a genuine antique." i can't believe my grandpa's really leaving." why does grandpa have to go, chuckie. do you think it was something i did." i think i had too much appley juice. i'll be right back, kay." you pack the same way you invent.

worry, chuckie, aunt betty promises this lady won't walk on her hands like the last one." i know it's different having all these women around, chuckie. we weren't ready for this. but it won't last long. i mean, really, how many single friends can betty have." i got seashells, rose petals, wedding bells, and wishing wells, but whyy would you ever want to fall in love. i've got the silver moon, and the month of june, jam and jellies sittin' on a spoon,but whyy would you ever want to fall in love. it's highly overrated, i think it's kind of dated, even falling for it since the caveman days, it's catchin' like the flu, they haven't got a clue, is there a vaccination for it on the way. i've got the staars, venus and maars, sittin' on a shelf in almond jars, but whyy would you ever want to fall in love." that tickles, daddy." tommy." tommy." what's that, tommy." tommy." tommy." it's okay, dilly. we're here." tommy. yippee." i wish you hadn't waked me up, dil. i was havin' fun with my
