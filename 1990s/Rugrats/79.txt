about that garage and but deed. stu, honey, if we don't do it now the dust bunnies are going to take over the house. the, the dust bunnies. you know what bunnies are chuckie. they're those soft fuzzy "aminals" that eat carrots and stuff. well, if they're so nice, why is your mom and dad so worried about 'em. they're worried 'cause dust bunnies aren't nothing like regular bunnies. dust bunnies are big, slimy, horrible monster bunnies. see these.dust bunny tracks. they sure got big feet. not big "humungrous". dust bunnies grow under the carpet all year long and can only escape when parents move the furniture. that's when the bunnies go searching for their "favortist" snack in the world: sweet, tender, little babies.they feel around with their long sticky ears and then they come after you. hop hop hop. and when they get you, they wrap you all up in their dust and drag you back to the kingdom of dust. no, no, no. no, no. don't take me away.don't, no. it's too late chuckie. the dust bunnies are out looking for delicious babies. and when they find you, they'll take you away and soak you in juice and stuff until you're soft and tender. and then the dust bunny king will eat you all up. ah. there's gotta be some place we can hide tommy. wait, angelica. if the dust bunnies only live under the carpetthe carpet, then that means we'd be safe in the kitchen, right. uh, sure... the kitchen. too bad it's all the way on the other side of the house. i guess you'll just have to stay here and get eaten by the dust bunnies. have a nice day. hahahahahstu in another room moving
