this is what i'm saying: christmas snagged all the righteous tunes. you've got your "silent night", your "white christmas", your "jingle bells, batman smells". what's hanukkah got. the dreidel song. yeah. that song makes no sense. why would anyone make a dreidel out of clay, when the plastic ones are basically free. hehey guys. my mom ever so slightly burnt 3 dozen angel cookies. they're ours for the gorgin'. sounds like your mom is already deep into the holiday spirit. she started cooking back in september. the frank insinger pork roast is looking particularly nasty.  what 'bout you, sus. you know, the whole carmichael family descending to pinch your cheeks, and hug you too hard.  i love the holidays. oh, did i tell you. i got a solo in the annual unity of faith concert at my church. way to go. we'll be there. wouldn't miss it. you know bro, that would be the perfect venue to premiere our soontobe classic hanukkah song. what hanukkah song. the one that's soon to be famous. pickles brothers are going to pay. you know, that's not such a bad idea. it's genius. i mean, how hard can it be to make up a song. i do it in the shower every morning. and guys, i sound good. so, angelica's seeing an aspen, phil and lil will be decking the halls. what have you guys got planned for the holidays, chuckie. oh, the usual: high expectations met by crushing disappointment.  it's amazing. 20 years of finster christmases on one convenient dvd.  and each one more depressing than the next.  awe com on, lighten up. your dad's going to love this gift.  when's your mom getting back from japan with kimi. christmas eve. my uncle's recovering nicely from the bad sushi incident.  i don't know what it is about my dad and christmas. fourth of july, awesome. the man's a maniac for arbor day. but christmas.  just once, i'd like a big, fancy celebration like everyone else. but you know what he'd say. "christmas starts with family, and ends with family."  maybe if he had better trees.  those are some of the sorriest christmas trees i've ever seen. now that you say it, they all are kind of sickly. and brittle. and brown.  if you've got a lousy tree, you're not gonna spring for the good tinsel.  and if you skip on the tinsel, why even bother with the mistletoe, the eggnog, and the gingerbread houses. it all makes sense now. 20 years of bad trees... 20 years of bad christmases. this time, when my dad and i go tree shopping, i'm gonna make sure we get a tree infected with the holiday spirit. and not termites.  here she is. top of the line. needles as soft as a cat's back. and just take a whiff.  wow.  it's like having the rockies in your own home. got anything less... majestic.  ohh. we've got some nice 5footers.  come on, dad, an eightfooter is a great deal. it's like buying in bulk. you like to buy in bulk. oh yeah, but only corn dogs and eye drops. the holidays aren't about the trappings, it's about being together. you know what i say.  christmas starts with family, and ends with family.  oh, how about those.  you mean death valley.  d'ohhh.  oh, how much for that beauty. 20 bucks.  15.  we'll come back for it tomorrow. it'll be down to 10.  thank you.  ohhh. oopsie.  they're throwing this out. you poor thing.  honey, where's the tree.  don't open, dad. don't open. don't open. upupupupup. okay, now... open.  wow. it's beautiful, chuckie. where'd you get it. it must've cost you a fortune. uh, not really. they were practically giving them away. so what do you think. oh gosh, i don't know. doesn't seem like a finster tree. i mean it's so... so... green. i just want to have a merry little christmas this year. if you don't like it... no, no. no. it's wonderful, chuckie. iii  thank you, son.  let's take a break. yeah, i'm dreidely spent.  get your new holiday drink samples. what are they. we've got honey baked java, yam latte, figgy pudding mochyato... i'll pass. maybe later. um, acid reflux. i'll try one. chuckie, wow. since when are you the brave one. what can i say. i'm full of christmas spirit this year. heehaw. hey, speaking of brave, did you guys hear about that christmas tree that was stolen the other night. where. right in front of the house on greenfield.  stolen. yep. the hillickis.  well, i guess that's one family that won't be having a merry christmas this year. what kind of person steals the symbol of love and human understanding.sicko.  i say we double up on our neighborhood watch. flush 'em out of town like the vermin they are. 'scuse me. looks like a big no for the fig latte. you stole a christmas tree.  i didn't know. help me, tommy. i don't want to get flushed out of town. i like this town. i know where everything is.  hey, if you thought they were throwing it out, then it wasn't really stealing.  it wasn't. sure. all you gotta do is tell your dad what happened, and take it back. he'll understand.  of course he will. he didn't seem to like it that much, anyway.  lookit, he hasn't even decorated it yet, tommy. this'll be a snap.  uh, dad. i need to tell you something. oh sure, just let me put these ornaments down.  you bought new christmas tree ornaments.  16 boxes. i started putting the old ones in old faithful here. i can't believe no one told me how shaudy they look. but dad, you said the holidays begin and end with family. oh. i smell gingerbread. you're baking cookies. no, houses. a complete gingerbread town. right down to the emergency call boxes.   so, you boys ready to see this puppy fired up.  your father's been workin' on it all day.  wow.  chuckie, is there something you wanted to tell me. what. uh...  uh, oh yeah... i uh, i wish kimi and kira were here to see this. oh, they'll see it. they should be getting on their plane right now.  oh chuckie, this is going to be the best christmas.  what do you mean we're bumped. your flight is full. you were bumped. next.  but we bought these tickets 3 months ago. yes, but you missed your first flight, which means you are on standby for this flight, which means you are bumped. next. mom. they can't get away with that. getting mad never solves anything. we'll just wait for the next flight.   thank you for almost flying japan international, where service is almost job 1.  i couldn't do it to him, tommy. he actually bought new ornaments. usually he just ducttapes the old ones. man, this is some rockin' gingerbread. tommy. how am i going to live with myself, knowing another family is going treeless, all because i wanted to have visions of sugar plums dancing in my head..  it's a metaphor.  i know. why don't i just buy the hillickis another tree. but you said those trees were megabucks. 50 dollars.. isn't there some way you can come down. 49.99.  come on, it was 20 bucks yesterday. supply and demand, kid. you saved up all year for that money. i know, but it's all worth it, knowing those 6 little hillicki children will have a tree to wake up to on christmas morning. besides, i still have 3 dollars and 58 cents left. hold on.  no. stooop. uh... tinsel, some lights, uh... maybe no one'll know.  yo susie, you got a word that rhymes with dreidel.  nothing rhymes with dreidel. maybe that's why hanukkah has only one song. hey mozart, where have you been. we've got moocho work to do.  what's the matter, chuckster. holiday blues got you down.  oh no. now i'm even sounding like my mother. well, who wouldn't be disappointed this year. we got some punk goin' around, stealin' christmas trees. that's why i'm puttin' in this here hightech survelliance camera. i wouldn't worry about those thieves. they'll get what's coming to them one way or another. what does that mean. you can't steal the meaning of christmas without the big guy upstairs not hearing about it. whoever took the hillickis' tree is in for a wicked smiting. smiting. you know.  heyhey chuckie, smile. you're on criminal camera.  chuckie.  oh christmas tree, oh christmas tree. how lovely are your branches.  oh, hello son, we were just rehearsing for the party.  you. a party. from now on, the name finster will be synonymous with christmas fun. hey, slap on a bonnet, and join the choir. we're singing "oh christmas tree."  oh christmas tree, oh christmas tree, how lovely are your branches. i think i'll go to bed.  i'm drained.  okay, we'll try to keep it down for you.  oh christmas tree, oh christmas tree. how lovely are your branches. don't cry, mummy. we'll have a tree next year.  oh, crooks are wretched thieves. now now, is that any way to talk on the lord's day. now let's say grace. chuckie.  yyes. it's meee. uh... mme who. who do you think. who's the burning bush guy.   aah.  i'm gonna be smited. i'm gonna be wicked smited. i said hawaii, chas. aloha. good news. chas, i have to go. i'll call you later.  you found our luggage. no, but i'm authorized to give you this itty bitty bag on macadamian nuts.   i'd rather you tell us where our luggage is. they are salty and delicious.  where's our luggage..  kimi, let's stay positive. i'm sure he's doing everything he can. they are very good with chocolate, these nuts. let's go to the mango club. their new fleece collection just came in. great idea. maybe they'll sell me 3 dollars and 58 cents worth of lint. what's up with him. it's two days to christmas, dil, we need a song. uh... how about a dance. that might be easier. a dance. yeah, uh, the hanukkah hustle, the dreidel hula. chuckie's with with me on this, aren't you, cman.  you. you're the cause of my misery. you're the reason the poor hillicki children are suffering right now. you. you with your soft branches, and perfectly spaced ornaments.  look at it, tommy. just standing here, mocking me. mocking me. what's he talking about, tommy. i, uh...  what are you looking at, fat man.. give me a break.  the holidays are stressful. well christmas is a sham. what do you say to that, huh.. i mean, look at this.  "away in a manager special." this is the meaning of christmas..  chuckie, let's go. fine, i'll go. but not without one of these.  hey, those are for customers only.   help me. what's wrong, chuckie. i've never seen you like this.  it's kind of attractive.  i'm the sicko who stole the tree. it was an accident, guys. he thought they were turfin' it. i made one little mistake, and now the whole town is after me. the man upstairs wants to zap me. i even have elves on my case. you know you're in trouble when the elves are after you. i'm sure whatever you did, chuckie, god will forgive you. i took the light and joy out of a family's christmas. if you don't get smited for that, what do you get smited for. i might as well stick a lightning rod on my head.  maybe you guys shouldn't be sitting next to me right now.  look for me at my dad's party. i'll be the one who's charred.  oh christmas tree, oh christmas tree. how lovely are your branches. i finally got the christmas i always wanted, and i couldn't be more miserable. hold on, everybody. that could be kira.  hello. oh, hi kira.  stuck in mexico. oh no.  they won't be home for christmas. this is all my fault. ever since i took that tree, everything's been turning bad. i wish i'd never seen it. well, you stole the tree. maybe you can unsteal it. how do i do that. you steal it.  nice work. psst. i was going to let you in.  go.   uh, guys. the door. no thank you.  gracias.  no thank you. i'm proud of you, mom. no thank you, gracias.  why. we're going to miss christmas. yeah, but through it all, you kept your cool. thanks, kimi. means a lot to me to hear you say that.  i've been through 3 states, and 2 continents.  i've been patient through 4 time zones. this cab is mine. mine. it's mine.  latkes all around...  in my ears and in my eyes... latkes is all around... in my nose and on my thighs... oh chuckie, i'm so sorry. dad, it wasn't your fault. it was those darn tree thieves.  why us. why.. betty warned me. i should've given you that dog early.  i'm getting a dog.. no. still, who takes a tree and leaves a kidmin x game. he probably thought they were all grandma sweaters. you got me kidmin x game. no.  well, kimi and kira are stuck in mexico, our tree is gone. christmas is officially ruined.  where'd all these pine needles come from. okay. okay. i did it. i stole the tree, twice. maybe three times. the way tommy said it, i'm still confused. just tell me what happened, son. i just wanted a big christmas, like everyone else has. now we have nothing. kira. kimi. you see, chuckie. we don't have nothing. we have everything. sometimes we... we all forget that. i know i did. wow. look at this place. hey, what happened to the tree. how about i tell you over breakfast. sure. in the meantime,  anything's better than the trees you pick out, sweetheart.  you're right, dad. christmas does begin and end with family. the first noel, the angel did say was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay. in fields as they lay, keeping their sheep, on a cold winter's night that was so deep. noel, noel, noel, noel. born is the king of israel.  now, representing our jewish brothers and sisters, here's a little something you probably haven't heard.  they're frying in the kitchen, they're burning in the pot. latkes all around us. get 'em while they're hot. latkes is all around us, in my ears and in my eyes. latkes is all around, in my nose and on my thighs. they're crispy, crunchy, salty. eat 'em by the stack. latkes all around us. gonna make you fat. hanukkah is coming, so shred those taters fast. be thankful it's a holiday, where you don't have to fast. ) )
