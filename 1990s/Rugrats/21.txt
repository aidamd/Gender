"there's something hanging from your left nostril. the snot sargent." oh man. pick me a winner brett.  phillip. so you wanna play alien elimanator after school. get away from me. now. i'll take that as a "maybe"... okay, a "no". wonderful. it's time now for everyone's favorite annual event: science projects and everyone gets a partner. brett and britney, howdy partners. next the dynamic duo, phil and lil. maybe you two should do a double helix project. get it. twins, double. please hold your applause. why are we partners on every project. it's always phil and lil this. phil and lil that. newsflash. we're not two heads on one body. we are just two seperate people who happen to live in the same house. he's phil and i'm lil. two names, seperated by the word "and". i am a thinking, breathing, independent individual and he's... phil. from now on think about me without phil. okay. okay.. uhhuh, yeah....no way. he actually said that. would you get off the phone. so what are you gonna wear. lil. let me call you back.what do you want. i wanna know how long you plan on vacationing on the planet mondo weirdo. i am not being mondo weird. yes you are. you don't wanna play anything, you're yelling at me, and your freaking out in front of everyone at school. just tell me this phase is almost over. first of all, i am sorry if i embarrassed you. second of all, this isn't a phase. this is real life. i am not doing this twin thing anymore, little brother. little brother. give me a break. so you're two minutes older. do you know what that is in girl years. now do you mind.. okay twinnies, it's that time when you choose which matching outfits your gonna where to twins canyon. they are our free ticket in. they just opened the vomitator 3. which of course your father will watch from a safe distance.  i can't wear those clothes. aw jeez, it was a two for one sale. i am not wearing any clothes there. but lil, it's not a nudie place. it's twins canyon. ugh. twins this, twins that. phil lil. it's never even lil and phil. there's too much "we". not enough "me". i am not wearing anything to that place because i am not going. ah you guys, you think it's possible to get shin splints in your shoulder. tommy, you're not listening. one minute, we're twins and everything's fine. and the next, it's "me", not "we". i mean, what's up with that. maybe a prehistoric mother worm laid her eggs in lil's brain. hey, sweat heads. why weren't you in gym, chuckie. i was exercising my right to say no to the president and his stupid test. i made a statement by refusing to show up.  chuckie finster skipped a class. actually i was hanging out in the nurse's office. you call pretending you're sick making a statement. chuckie, this test is important. maybe to you. it's like all that stuff we sweated over our whole lives. remember in third grade, the book report and macaroni box we did. well guess what. landfill, tommy, landfill. and the fourth grade state capital test. oskosh, trenton, timbucktu. who cares. it's like that "ebeforei" thing. like i'm ever gonna use that. you could get in serious trouble. so what. i've been humiliated year after year and now my suffering's over. today i am taking a stand for coordinatelychallenged kids eveywhere.  and tomorrow. tommy, don't ruin my moment. how about one twin half price. one twin dresses as both twins. one twin holding a picture of the other twin. just because one twin wants to assert her independence and doesn't want to come, doesn't mean she doesn't exist. besides, that leaves an extra seat on the vomitator three...yeah... well, "tough sticky buns" to you too. jeez.this is awful. i know, we even have to have another set of twins or actually pay for a vacation. no howie, we have a bigger problem than a lost vacation. our little lil is sad. right. she wants to be treated like her own person, and that's fair. although i am gonna miss seeing you on the tea cups of torture. hi diane, what's up.. hey brett, how you doing. i'm doing pretty good.  ahh. i get that a lot. what's up. look pup, here it is in a nutshell. we want to apolgize for treating you and philly like a single package all the these years. you gotta cut us some slack, you two came into our world at the same time. one of us came two minutes earlier, thank you very much. and that same one is growing up a little faster. so lay it on me, what can me and your father do to make you, lillian marie jill deville, feel like you have your own identity, huh. you have been vaporized. anyone here wanna be my copilot. reporting for duty. sir. okay, anyone else wanna be my copilot. phil, i've been thinking, and it seems we have the same problem we're both suddenly twinless. uh, dil. you've never been a twin. exactly. it's one more thing i can check off my "to do" list. sure i've never twinned before, but what the heck. plus it works out. you need a lil and i'm a dil. f.y.i. banana head, i still have lil. but she bailed. i can be a better twin. more hands on. you have been vaporized. we can do this all day, huh twinny. what.  what's going on. i'm moving out. what. mom and dad said i could move in to the office "slash" workout room. i'll miss that room. so your just gonna leave me here by myself. wasn't anyone gonna tell me. oh boy. twin problems come in twos. calm down philly, lil gets her own room but think about it, so do you, and the computer stays here. and you finally have room for that basketball hoop you've always wanted, and you can paint the place any color you like, except tangerine cause it makes your father wig out.  it's not like you lost her, she's just across the hall. ow. snap out of it howie, setting up my thighinator machine is a lot harder that plugging in your calculator. hey brother, let's get busy. okay, ready who am i. i don't look like that. and i don't walk like that. hey who know's better than your twin. so i thought we could bond over some beforeschool spitting. nah, that's kind of mine and lil's thing. she's the champ, she once hocked it across the street. okay, we won't spit, but hey, it's time for shirts. say twins. so where you hiding out today. janitor's closet. no, i told you, i am publically refusing to take that test. come on ladies. uhoh here comes pangborn, i'll be hiding in the bathroom.  i know what your thinking, cause i got that twin esp thing going. okay, what am i thinking. that this twin thing is working.  meet me up top. dil, we gotta slow this twin thing down. it's not like your not trying. i mean that mash potato sculpture of us arm in arm was pretty cool. i hated to eat it. you ate the sculpture. i saved the ears. they're in the freezer. say no more. in the world of twins, when you eat the potato sclupture, you've said good bye. uh, i guess your right. it's okay, i understand. it's time i was moving on. somewhere out there are real twins, yearning to make me their triplet.   yes. ladies, come on. come on. come on.  where's finster. uh when you say finster, do you mean elliot finster, or fritzi finster, or, or, four finger finster. can it pickles. or should i say, jar it.. ha ha ha. good joke, sir. never heard that one before. help. so my outfit for the party is all set. it's hanging in my room. did i tell you i got my own room. way to go girl. finster, come out, come out where ever you are. i never thought it would end like this, i wonder what they'll say about me in the school paper. i wonder what picture they'll use. i hope it's one from before i got my braces. oh look a shark...a shark. finster. what happened. what are you doing in here. drowning, sir. oh, and not taking the test. of course you're not, i can see that. i can also see some of the best controsity and physicallity since i wrestled a boise bloodletter in '88. one heck of a match. um, mr. pangborn, could you help me down please. oh right. you held it for over an hour. that's amazing chuckie.  yep, and i think by tomorrow i'll be able to put my arms down.  what you did was probably even harder than the presidential fitness test. okay finster, take a day for your arms to heal.  thanks mr. pangborn. i'll just plan on you taking the test tomorrow.  oh. lil, there's someone here for you. hey girlfriend. you look awesome. thanks, you too. let's hit it. well i think you two both look awesome and... and "rad". we got some really cool

looking, than i guess you think i am too. no, no, no... we weren't saying that. it's not like you don't know this, right. i mean, phil is kind of a jerk. hey. i can call him a jerk or a slob, but you guys can't. you don't even know him. he can actually be cool sometimes and fun and funny and loyal. sorry. we didn't mean.... the twin thing is a really strong bond and kind of magnetic. like i can
