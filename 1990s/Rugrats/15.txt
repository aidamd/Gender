taking diapers to work with him in his briefcase." now, listen, charles, i've been reading all about pottytraining in lipschitz, and it's really quite simple." so you just go off and have a good weekend. we'll take care of chuckie and we'll make sure he uses his potty." his what. oh. oh, yeah. well. okay. but if there's any trouble, call the hotel." we're not gonna have any trouble, we'll be

getting pottytrained. it's the worstest thing that's happened to me since my mom put me on the bottle." what are you gonna do." i don't know. i've tried everything." aybe you could put a lot of napkins in your pants and use em' like a diaper. i tried it." maybe you could poop in your room and hide it in your toy box." tried it." maybe you could just stop pooping altogether." tried it. it's no use. no matter what i do, it looks like i'm gonna have to be... pottytrained." ha. you little babies really make me laugh. first you cry for your mommies every time you get a little wet." and now, finally, you get to go without em' forever, and what do you do. chicken out. what's the matter. little baby scared to be without his diapers." no, that's not it. i'm not scared. i, i just don't want to be pottytrained, that's all. it's just not right." not right.. ha. that's a good one. don't you dummies know anything. everybody who's anybody is pottytrained." well, not me. i'm never gonna do it. they can't make me. i'm gonna wear my diapers forever, and no one is gonna stop me. not my mom, not my dad. not the present of the benited steaks."  because i..." chuckie." i..." what's the matter,

deed." well, according to lipschitz, we're supposed to wait righthere until he does his business, then give him plenty of praise so that he gets the right idea." we just wait." that's what the book says, we just... wait." oh." hmm. got any fives." hey, chuckie, are you okay." is it so much to ask, tommy. is it so much to ask. i just want things to stay the way they've always been." aw, come on, chuckie, why are you acting like such a baby." yeah, they're gonna make you do it anyway, why don't you just go along with it." oh. yeah, when it happens to you guys, maybe that's what you should do." happens to us.. nah." well, i guess i don't have to go after all." uhoh." thanks, honey." anytime, deed." you know, stu, i just cant believe it. i mean, chuckie was standing right next to the potty."

tough." i know, i know." yeah, i mean, how do you know when you have to go." what's it feel like, anyway." i don't know. that's really the hard part. i mean, sometimes i think i have to go, but i don't, and other times, i don't think i have to go, and i do. i really, really do. oh. now i'm so confused." perhaps we should do for chuckie what my mommy did for me." oh, no." what's wrong, chuckie." i don't know. i thought i had to go, but then i didn't." and now i do," and now i don't." do. don't. do. don't." oh, chuckie, you're funny. don't you know that going to the potty's is what you have to do when you get old. if you don't know how do it, you can't never go to school, or drive a car, or join the army, or none of that fun stuff." i don't care. as bob as my witness, i'm never
