appears, it's time to take the baby to the you know where. stu: i can't believe you wanna take him to the dentist. didi:  don't say dentist, you'll scare him. stu: oh come on, he doesn't know what a, you know is. didi: just say tooth fairy. it sounds nicer. stu: tooth fairy. that's who leaves quarters under your pillow. the other guys use drills and needles. i don't wanna think about it. didi: oh, just because you're afraid, of the tooth fairy doesn't mean tommy will be. stu: afraid. i'm not afraid of tooth fairies, or their drills, or their metal instruments.  didi: now let's see. i have diapers, wipies, a book, a cap, a change of clothes, bandages in case of an emergency and two extra bottles of juice.  didi: time to go see the tooth fairy.  dr. homer: open. open.  didi: the dentist, uh, tooth fairy doesn't want to hurt you. no no, he just wants to take a little peak inside your mouth.  dr. homer: dolly says, open. didi: come on tommy please, be a good helper and open your mouth. stu:  be a good helper.  dr. homer:  open the gate, for the truck to come through. didi:  open your mouth for mister snuggle bunny. dr. homer:  i'll give you this nice sugar free sucker if you open.
