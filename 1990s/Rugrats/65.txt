i've tried everything. decongestants, herbal remedies, chanting. have you got somewhere where i can put this handkerchief. uh, no. what's the matter, chuckie. uh, it's my nose again tommy. it's so stuffy i've got to breathe through my mouth and then my tongue dries out and sticks to my teeth. on really hot days, i suck the juice out of "grasschoppers." uh, it wouldn't be so bad except it makes the hair on my arm all crusty. and the solar cells on the sunflower power the electric motor. pretty ingenious, huh. on a sunny day, you can mow a whole park with this baby. well, it's very nice stu, but, wuh, couldn't you just push it. hm.. here's an invention you might be able to use, chaz. what's that. it says the famous sinus specialist, dr. brander, has come up with a devise that will clear up even the stuffiest nose. oh, yuck. i guess it's worth a try. mr. finster. i am dr. brander. uh, hello doctor. and you must be chuckie do you really think your invention can help chuckie. let me show you something. this is cheddar the rat, not the cheese. observe closely. um, no offense doc, but all rats eat cheese. ah, but let me show you cheddar before i treated him with the noserator. then i applied the noserator prototype. amazing. doc, chuckie's all yours. don't worry, little fellow. it'll be over in just a second. stand aside now mr. finster. hi tommy. it's me. oh, what happened. you sound funny. my dad took me to a doctor and she put a big spider and made it jump and then this morning i waked up and i could breathe, tommy. wow, is it real different. well, i guess so. what do you when you can breathe in your nose. hmmm...oh, try breathing this. that gives me a funny feeling in my nose. that's a smell, chuckie. wow. do other things have that. sure. aaaahhh. oooh. what else can we whatcha guys doing. ew. what's that smell. you'll get used to it. go chuckie. i've never seen him run so fast before. i think it's 'cause his nose isn't stuffy "no" more. i got him. hey, hey, come

vegetables.. isn't that funny. i didn't wanna. my mom made me. thanks, chuckie. uh, i don't have to give you nothin' do i. no, it's just great to be me. the "bestest" smeller in the whole world. hello. mr. finster, this is dr. brander. i'm afraid i have bad news. we, what is it doc. i think you better come to my office and bring chuckie. hi, chuckie. who is your friend. his name is cheddar. the doctor gave him to me as a present. i guess she figures we belong together. aw, i don't think you'll both fit in there. i mean, we belong together 'cause cheddar's nose is all stuffy again. pretty soon mine will be too. i'll just be another dumb baby who can't breathe in his nose or do "nothing" special. hey, carrot top. come on carrot top, sit up so i can kick sand in your face. no thank you. so you don't want to play, huh.how about if i beat you up and take your rat. hey, put cheddar down. he didn't do nothing to you. make me. give me that. hey, quit it. run chuckie. quick chuckie. jump
