navel piercing exactly like emica's. piercing. i fainted when my mother got contacts.  so, what's up with this "living skills" seminar. no books, no tests, what's the catch. i hear they pair everybody up in fake marriages.  just so you know, angelica, if we end up together, i'm going to have to put my foot down about that belly button ring.  unless you really want it.  guys, guys. did you hear.. did you hear.. i know. living skills class. no, about me. i was nominated for a national junior presidential achievement scholarship. big deal. i'm getting a navel piercing just like emica.  oh yeah, that'll get you into harvard.  i can't believe neil stant is going to be signing his rocking new shoes at the mall.  who.  only the world's greatest soccer player.  the man's a genius infield, with a boot like a cannon.  and i'll be stuck in school.  or maybe we won't.  what're you saying. we can't ditch school. we'll get caught. it'll be cake. we'll just leave the house like we do every morning, except we'll go to the mall. no one'll ever know.  oh, why'd you tell me that. now mr. shackley will ask me where you are, and i'm a terrible liar. ii blink when i lie. so, come along. you can shoot video for the local news.  i'm in.  hey t, i need you to walk with me to school tomorrow. i need to carry the entire solar system, and there's a couple of new nebula i discovered. aww gee, i can't.

three things my exboyfriend although lacked. the man has a sensitivity of a potato.  but i digress. after choosing mates, you will be assigned occupations, and together you will plan a wedding. learn to budget, and make provisions for children. excuse me, ms. o'keats. i'm not sure i'm ready for a wife. can't i just take home the class goldfish.  not a wife, charles. for this special class, you will be known as "spouse 1", and "spouse 2."  i have written half of the class' names on pieces of paper. the other half will choose a partner from this greasy paper bag.   darryl, darryl, darryl.  angelica, angelica, angelica.    harriet. who's harriet.  that's me.  great.  leslie kaminski. there's no leslie in this class. that's me.  fridge kamiski  your name is leslie.  heh, nice name.     susie carmichael..  angelica i can't be married to her. sorry. just like in life, you'll have to learn to live with your choices. tomorrow, we'll begin your fake life with a field trip.  now, let's see what disappointments the world of employment has in store for you.  bye, mom.  well, we're off to school now. like we do every morning. yep, here we go... to school.  you think i sounded nervous. not at all...  swamp thing. it isn't fair. darryl ends up being an internet zillionaire married to brianna, a supermodel, while i'm a plumber married to a waitress with 6 kids.  chillax, it's not even real. now the junior presidential scholarship. that's real.  prestigous high school, elite music conservatory.  i wow them with this speech today, and i'm gold. can't you put that on the floor. uhuh. that laptop has the only copy of my speech on it. it is staying where i can see it.  maybe i can still break them up before the wedding.  siddown. 5 hours from now, my life is going to change forever, and i don't want you messing with it. so, just hitch your caboose to the susie express, and ride your way to an easy a.  but before city hall and the marriage bureau, we would be visiting various shops to research wedding costs. oh, and i'd like to thank principal pangborn for volunteering to chaperone today.  i thought we were going to the zoo. now, why would i say "zoo". part of our first 'c', "communication", is listening. perhaps you'd like to cover this with the class. i can't. i have to face forward, or i ralph.  oh, how romantic. so uh, you want to be spouse 1, or spouse 2.  uh, i know this is kinda awkward, me being the breadwinner and you having to give up your career to raise our 3 kids, but i really think we could make this work.  i always wanted to get married on a beach, with bagpipes. you're kidding. so did i. what's your favorite sandwich. cucumber and onions... on wheat.  angelica, hurry up. we're not supposed to be trying these on. oh, lighten up. we can't afford this anyway, not on your crummy salary. maybe if you took a night job. it's not real. okay everyone, it's time to leave this graveyard of shattered dreams.  angelica, hurry.  uh oh. quick, get me out of this.  i'm stuck.  ow. my nose, my nose. stop complaining, and suck in your head. finster, kaminski. carmichael, pickles. here.  here.  y'know, for something so expensive, you think they could've thrown in a zipper.  oh no. they're gone.   well, i hope you're happy.  and this is where you get your marriage license. the first step in that amazing adventure called "life." fishing, fishing, fishing. that's all you ever talk about.  i'm a fisherman.  and there's your fairytale ending. clipboard, comb... can't help feeling like i've lost something.  where are susie and angelica.. i can't believe they left without us. this downtown air is not good for combination skin. stop whining. i got it wired: wer'e supposed to meet our class for lunch by the horse statue, and there it is.  that doesn't look like a horse. it's modern art. it's not supposed to look like what it is. besides, how many horse statues can they have in one park. they knew we were supposed to meet here. how many horse statues can there be in one park. we'll double back. knowing angelica, she probably got caught up shopping. i should've brought my car. i have flares. we're only minutes away from meeting the world's greatest soccer player. this was the best idea you've ever had. was that mom's car.. no. would you relax.. think about it. you can be at school right now, like the rest of the world.  whoa. actually, i think the rest of the world is here. guys. hey, guys.  hey, tommy. how'd getting out of the house go.  piece of cake. yo, t.  dil.  how'd you know i was ditching.  oh, i don't know.  frankly, i'm hurt you'd leave your little bro behind.  did i ever not invite you when i was in a fourth dimension i don't consider being thrown in the living closet to smell your farts another dimension.   i don't get it. they were supposed to be here for lunch. this is a disaster. tell me about it. this is just the kind of crisis that could bring brianna and darryl together. don't you ever think about anything but you, and your imaginary problems.. i need to get back to school for my interview.  you got any money. lipstick, lipliner, lip brush, cell phone... oh. cell phone. cell phone. yes. way to go, angelica. oh, no juice. way to go, angelica.  wait a minute. my backpack. where's my backpack. oh, i had it right here. oh, where's my backpack.. so what. your mom will buy you a new backpack. do you know how many backpacks i've lost by accident on purpose. did any of them have a laptop in it with a 3page speech that was going to change your destiny no, but one had an emica keychain in it that i really liked.  i left it at the bridal shop.  come on, we're gonna go back.  forget it. i'm waiting here for our class.  fine, i'm going.   eh, you want to buy some stereo speakers.  a live ferret.  wait up.   they left here an hour ago. an hour.. i don't think i can handle the stress.  doeth thith look thwollen to you. i'll notify the authorities. useless. just like arthur.   i don't get it. why don't they have heads anymore.  hey harold, i need your advice. you're a fake psychiatrist. how come fridge never listens to me. you have to find a common interest. ours is origami.  we're not lost. the bridal store is just around this corner.  wait a minute. this tattoo parlor wasn't here before.  right. they just put it up an hour ago.  tattoo parlor hmm... hey sorry hon, we don't do piercings unless you're 18 or older.  listen lady, i may look like i'm fresh off the pond, but i've been around the block. trust me, i've seen it all.   uh, i don't suppose i can leave her here with you.  i'm a good boy. i'm a good boy. i'm in a safe place. no one can hurt me now. knock it off. yeah phil, no one's going to catch us. yeah, it's not like the security guys in the mall are paying attention. they're too busy scarfing down cheese on a stick. security guys. yeah. the ones watching all those survelliance cameras.  i'm a good boy. won't get in trouble. i'm a good boy. you know, for someone who's always mapping out their future, you have one lousy sense of direction.  fine, i'll ask someone, okay. get off my back, woman.  excuse me, is there a bridal store arou....   excuse me, do you know if....   everything's in korean. really maybe that's why they call it korea town... boy, i must be really hungry, 'cause that duck hanging by its neck in that window is looking good.  hey, found a dollar. yes.  there's a payphone. ooh, we can get the number for the bridal shop, tell them to hold my backpack, have them call the school, the susie express is back on track.  ever tried kimchi. it's not bad.  and i got this whole thing for a dollar.  what. what. you just ate my future.   future, future, future, can't you talk about anything else.. it wouldn't hurt of you thought about yours once in a while. i think about my future.  did you know how long i spend every night laying out my clothes for the next morning.  this is getting us nowhere. i think it's time to use the 3 c's: communication, cooperation, and compromise. bossy. bigmouth. i wish we never got married. we didn't...  back off, sister. i got one hour to find my laptop and get to school, and i am not going to let anything get in my way.  can't take it, can't take it, i can't take it anymore. you might as well just bit me for that baberam right now, 'cause my future is dead. how's this sound.: "would you like fries with that."  come on, susie, we'll get back. i have a plan many i have to accessorize for tomorrow. how do you do that. do what. skate through life, focus on the most superficial things without any concern for the future.  we're 13, it's our job.  you know susie, you can plan every second of life. but won't that be kind of boring. all i'm saying is if you're only looking down the road, you'll never see the halfoff signs along the way. i've got kimchi in my pocket, and i'm not afraid to use it. what are you two girls doing way out here. we're lost. do you know that bridal shop near the park. oh, let's just go home. sure, i know it. got my dress there. want to see my wedding picture.  here you go.  there he is, phil. there he is. no thanks, i told you, it's rico.  what. you can't. sorry. hey. just you hold on. this is my sister. she's his biggest fan. she knows all his moves, she has all his posters... shh. they're gonna figure out we ditched. i don't care. i am not leaving until she gets his autograph.  and neither are we.  oh fine, this way.  thanks... rico.   i talked to the police, and they have staked out the school. they're sure the girls will turn up. i keep seeing their little faces. so alone, so scared. i feel so helpless.  you really care about these children, don't you. i never realized what a sensitive, caring... bald man you are. what can i say. i have so much love to give.  ack. help me. agh. help me.  ugh, i don't know anymore.  what do i have to do to reach you. just once, i'd like to hear "how's the egg salad, chuckie." um, um i'm sorry, did you say something. i, i'm deaf in this ear.  you're deaf. sure. i thought everybody knew that. look who you're talking to. i'm not exactly in the loop. wow.  all this time, i thought you were ignoring me. chuckie, right.  yeah. so uh, how was your egg salad. mr. pangborn, they're here. oh, joy. i better get a volume for this.  you know, you don't have to agree with me on everything. i feel the exact same way. see. like that. i'm moving out.  wow, i thought they'd be together forever.  you know, this marriage thing is a lot harder than it looks.  oh. you know angelica, i am glad we ended up together. you taught me you have to enjoy the journey, not just the destination. exactly. like if i hadn't gotten into that tattoo parlor, we wouldn't be making it back in time for your interview right now. oh, but we hadn't gone into that tat shop if you hadn't made us late in the first place. we wouldn't have been "late" if you hadn't lost your old backpack.  i wouldn't have lost my backpack, if your big head hadn't gotten stuck in that dress. bigmouth. bossy. i wish we never got married. we didn't... did anybody call the police, and tell them the girls are safe. whoops. oh well. we'll call when we get to school, mr...  pangborn. call me... estes.  estes...   i am never gonna wash this shirt again. or these socks, or these shorts. maybe i just won't bathe. i don't know why i got all agro, man, i knew we'd get away with it. we are a lean, mean, hooky machine. okay, we ditched. we admit it. i'm sorry. i'll never do it again. i swear. don't take me away.  he's a bad influence.  ) )
