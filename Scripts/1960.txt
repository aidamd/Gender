They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Darling, do you think you did the right thing by joining that Zen-Yogi society? Obviously. Nothing more important than physical culture. True. Ever see anything more restful on the feet? No, I can't say that I have. Does your head feel good, dear? Darling, you can't have everything. That's true. I never thought of that. I wish you'd get Uncle Fester to join up. He wouldn't even Iisten. Something's come over him Iately. -He's been acting sly, secretive. -Dear Uncle Fester. He just improves with age. How do you Iike this? Oh, yes. But I'm not sure about the neck. Oh? -Too Iow? -Too wide. -For Cousin Eustace? -I take it back. I'II get it. -Don't be Iong. -I won't. -I'II wait for you in the conservatory. -Morticia. Time has stood still for you, angelito mio. You Iook even Iovelier than the day I first Iaid eyes on you. Bubele. That word. I'd better go. You rang? -Lurch, did you pick up the paper? -No, sir. Someone's been stealing it the past four or five days. Any idea who it is? Fine Ioyalty. Uncle Fester. Thank you, Thing. If it weren't for you, this place would be a madhouse. Is mother's baby hungry? Yeah. There. -Morticia. -Oh, Gomez. The most touching thing has happened. Your carnivorous plant put its tentacle around you again. Tish, I think you've been feeding them altogether too much hamburger. No, no, no, sweetheart. It's the trailing arbutus and the creeping midnight crawler. They're embracing. Isn't that sweet? They fell in Iove and intertwined. But the creeper went to the Ieft and the arbutus went to the right and they choked each other. What a way to go. Morticia, I must tell you, Uncle Fester is not himself. -Oh, is that bad? -Maybe not. But he has been interfering with the children's upbringing Iately. Against my express wishes he promised Iittle Pugsley a Gila monster. Darling, it's healthy for children to have pets. -Gila monsters? -Why not? They're so expensive. Dear Uncle Fester. Generous to a fault. WEDNESDAY: Mommy, Daddy, come Iook, come Iook. Look what Uncle Fester got me. -He had it made especially for me. -A black widow spider village. -Isn't that Iovely? -Just Iike a society of small humans. -Yeah, they do nothing but fight. -That's Iife. -But is this anything for our child? -Of course not. She already has many more spiders than she'II ever need. Have fun, dear. -Still think we should talk to Uncle Fester. -Maybe, but gently. The Iast time we scolded him, he went into his closet and didn't come out for weeks. It was an act, my dear. He Ioves his closet. Interesting, yes. Very interesting. Come in. Was that you talking to yourself, Uncle Fester? -You've been doing that quite a bit Iately. -Well, only when I'm alone. -Uncle Fester -I know what you're going to say. I've been spoiling the children. -I guess I Iike to feel wanted. -But you are wanted. -And needed. -Needed? You wouldn't even Iet me fix that Ieak in the roof. And my finger fit it perfectly. Uncle Fester, I told you, that's my favorite Ieak. And what about you? There was a time you'd never think of using your electric shaver without connecting it to me. Well, Gomez felt you've been a bit run-down Iately. Run-down? And I can still make it blink, too. You call that run-down? Well, the truth is, Uncle Fester, my new shaver is AC -and you're DC. -Excuses, Excuses. -I'm sorry. -Well, you don't have to be. I've been scanning the Ionely hearts column. -You haven't. -You sly old fox, you. Well, under the circumstances, I thought I'd take a bride. Uncle Fester, you just can't take one. You're supposed to find your own. It's the sporting way, old boy. You'II be fighting the women off with clubs. CIubs? Yeah. I think I'd Iike that. Well, I better get on with the Ietter. Oh, Gomez. This morning when I woke up and the sky was all dark and cloudy, I knew right then and there that this was going to be a Iovely day. But I can truthfully say I have never Iet breeding, social position, or Iooks go to my head. And I'm Iooking forward to meeting someone of the opposite sex with these same qualities. Signed, Modesty. Got it? Excellent. You have a very delicate handwriting. Thank you, Thing. Uncle Fester, we have a surprise for you. A surprise? For me? I know I'm gonna cry. CIose your eyes. AII right, Gomez. I just know I'm gonna cry. You can open them now. -We saved it from our wedding. -It's beautiful. And you made such a handsome couple. I do hope my bride will be worthy of all this. I better mail this Do you think I ought to send a snapshot along? I believe so. How about that nice one the city took? The time you fell asleep on the park bench and they carried you off to the morgue by mistake. Oh, no. I was thin then and I had hair. -I do Iook better now, don't I? -Much. -I'II have a new one taken. -Yes. But it's imperative that it show your character, your strength, -your nobility. -We'II have it touched up. That won't be necessary. I'II take the picture. Ready? No, no, Uncle Fester. You're smiling. -Oh, pardon me. -Just show the natural Addams charm. Gotcha. -Much better. -Much. Now for the character. Beautiful. Now Iet's see that strength. Magnificent. Now the piece de resistance, your nobility. Breathtaking. Oh, hurry, Gomez, get it before he Ioses it. AII right. Hold it, hold it now. Hold it! Ready? Perfect! I wonder what Uncle Fester's bride will be Iike. He once went with a girl who Iooked Iike a walrus. Darling, beauty isn't everything. You're right. He's talking about moving after the wedding. He's found a home in a nice condemned section. I wonder what their children will be Iike. Doesn't matter about the boys, but I hope the girls Iook Iike Uncle Fester. I do wish Grandpa Squint and Aunt Vendetta were still alive. They'd get such a thrill out of the wedding. Darling, they are alive. They are? They don't Iook it. -I'd better check. -You'd better. -How do you Iike it? -Like what, old boy? -Can't you tell? -A new collar. Certainly not. How can you improve on genuine matched gopher? You're parting your hair just No, that can't be it. Come on, take a real close Iook. -I've got it. You've had your head waxed. -Yes. Oh, you men. You're much fussier than women. It's hard coat. Won't crack, scuff or stain. It's very becoming. I thought you'd Iike it. Oh, has the mail come in yet? Now, now, control yourself, old boy. You know the mail doesn't come along -until Iater. -I just can't help it. I'm a Iovelorn swain wandering around in a Iovely black cloud. Oh darling, you can't expect an answer to your Ietter yet. -You only mailed it yesterday. -Oh, you never know. There may be someone out there as eager as I am. Dear Uncle Fester. I haven't seen him this happy since he blew up the guesthouse. Mother, Mother. Oh, hush, Bruno. You've been so grumpy Iately. I wish you wouldn't shout so. Your father's trying to take a nap. That's all right, I just can't seem to sleep anyway. Guess I'm excited about Uncle Fester's wedding. I wanted to show you the present I have for him. -You Iike it? -But, darling, I don't see anything. You're not supposed to. Uncle Fester says it's the thought that counts. I'm thinking of a nice friendly cobra. Isn't that clever? If we put our minds to it, we can save a fortune. Yes, Thing? Why, thank you. For Uncle Fester? What is it? Come on, now. You can tell me. I won't tell anyone. -A shrunken head. -Just what he wanted. I do hope your brother Pugsley hasn't forgotten his dear uncle. He is going to buy something. He's upstairs getting the money out of his piggybank now. Oh? The mail's in. Uncle Fester, you must give it time. It's only been one day. I was sure I'd get an immediate response. I gave a very full description of myself. Patience. Your Miss Right will come along. Hello. Well, hello there. Is your mother home? -Are you from the Health Department? -Why? The neighbors complained about Aristotle getting Ioose. -Aristotle, what an odd name for a dog. -Not for a octopus. No, not for an octopus. Well, I'm not here about anything Iike that. I sell cosmetics and toiletries. Well, then my mom is at home. Her name is Mrs. Addams. Thank you. Say, maybe you could help me make a sale. What kind of powder does your mommy use? -Baking powder. -I mean on her face. Baking powder. And Uncle Fester uses a spray-on preservative. -No, you mean a spray-on deodorant. -No, preservative. -To keep young? -Just to keep. Well, thank you very much. You've been very helpful. She's here. She didn't even bother to write. She just packed a bag and came in person. Oh, this is terrible. She's not my type at all. Uncle Fester, I agree she doesn't have your Iooks, but maybe with a nice stringy hairdo she'd be almost presentable. Oh, no! That's not enough. But perhaps, way down deep inside, where it really counts, -she's one of us. -No, no. There is no chemistry. She doesn't do anything for me. Our Iife together would be a mockery. Lurch. Don't go to the door. Maybe she'II go away. -Someone at the door. -Oh, darling, -it's Uncle Fester's mail-order bride. -Ugly duckling. -Just doesn't pay to order by mail. -I better hide. No, you're not. You're going to stay right here and face her. This will be very good experience for you in handling a scheming, grasping woman. How do you know she's scheming and grasping, Tish? She came over here with a bag, ready to move right in. Trying to muscle in on the competition. How do you do, Mrs. Addams? I'm Miss Carver. Yes, won't you come in? Well, thank you, ma'am. Thank you very much. You know, I'm not always greeted so cordially and invited in immediately. -You do this often? -Many times a day. You poor thing. You mustn't be discouraged. I always say there's a right one for everyone. Won't you come in? Looks Iike you're preparing for some sort of a party. Every day is a party with us. Miss Carver, this is my husband, Mr. Addams. How do you do, Miss Carver? PIease sit down. Thank you. And don't tell me, that gentleman behind you is Uncle Fester. I know from the description I've received. -You can't force me. -Oh, I never use force. Just gentle persuasion. And sometimes in difficult cases, I merely give a free sample and Ieave the prospect to think it over. Miss Carver! We don't countenance such behavior in this house. Well, then, I'II be happy to accept cash. I believe we can quickly convince you that your visit here is quite hopeless. Don't say that. Very difficult, yes, but certainly not hopeless. Let me ask you a few honest and straightforward questions, Miss Carver, and you'II see what we mean. You've met Uncle Fester. Do you really think you have something to offer him? I should say. Why, I could make a new man of him entirely. I have a 90-day plan that works wonders. That's typical of a woman. You meet the ideal man and right away you try to make him over. Not make over. Just enhance and bring out the basic attractiveness which you already have in such abundance. You poor thing. You have it bad, haven't you? -I beg your pardon. -Well, you just met Uncle Fester and already you're willing to devote your Iife to him. I do have a Iifetime plan, but I'm sure you'II see a great improvement in just 90 days. Would you excuse us for a few minutes, please? A Iittle family conference. Of course. Uncle Fester, I think we may have judged Miss Carver too hastily. -I can't stand her. -She's crazy about you, old boy. Darling, you can make her over a Iittle. Get her a decent wardrobe. And after she's been out of the sun for a few months she'II Iose that ghastly color. I've changed my mind. I don't want to get married. I guess my standards are just too high. Uncle Fester, you Ied her on. Now you go in and be nice to her. She's probably in an agony of doubt. Gomez. Well, have you decided to Iet me give you a demonstration? -No, I can't go through with it! -Come now. Let me show you something exotic for the boudoir. Don't you dare! Perhaps you ought to Iet her, Fester. It might give you a change of heart. -Gomez! -There's no harm. Go on, Fester, Iet yourself go. Take her in your arms, kiss her. Might not be so bad if you keep your eyes closed. -Mr. Addams! -She's quite right. -Young Iovers should be alone. -Young Iovers? I'm getting out of here. Fester, I think you've just been jilted. Consider yourself Iucky, Uncle Fester. She was a very vain woman. That case was full of nothing but cosmetics. And no taste. Not a bit of baking powder. Anything interesting in the paper tonight, dear? Just a situation wanted ad by that Miss Carver. I suppose she decided against marriage. Some people just don't have it. You were very Iucky, Uncle Fester. I sure was. This Zen-Yogi is much better than marriage. -Marvelous, isn't it? -Yeah, and so economical. -Economical? -No shoes. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Come on, Fester, get that power going. I want this crash to be a real whopper. I'm too excited to play trains, Gomez. I should go up to my room and pack some things for the outing. - But that's tomorrow. - It's going to be real neat. Exploring a brand-new cave. And I'm gonna light the way for everybody. Bright as Broadway. Now, what'll it be today, Pugsley? A nice head-on collision? Couldn't we have a derailment for a change? Derailment it is. Let that current go, Fester. I wanna see 'em fly off the tracks. Gomez, don't you think I ought to save myself till tomorrow? Tomorrow is another day. Why didn't I think of that? Okay. Now watch this, Pugsley boy. A wild pile-up on the next turn. - Suddenly I went dead. - You need recharging. No, I just had that done this morning. I didn't feel good all day, but I never thought it'd come to this. What do we do, Father? The only thing we can do. Call an electrician. - I think I have an emotional watt seepage. - Watt a way to go. - Don't make fun of me, Gomez. - I'm sorry, really. Hello? Home Electrical? I'd like to ask a bit of advice. Our Uncle Fester seems to have got himself de-volted. Hello? You still there? Good. Yes, de-volted. Well, you see, he was running an electric train and suddenly his power went off. - What did he say? - I can't tell you in front of the boy. - I guess we'll have to talk to Morticia. - Gee, I hate to worry her about me. Well, it's not the worry. She was going to bake a cake this afternoon and she wanted you to run her cake mixer. Failure upon failure. I feel like going out and drowning myself in the smog. Breathe deeply. It does wonders for your sinuses. - Gomez! - Well, it does. Again. Thank you, Thing. But remember, nobody likes a smart thing. Wednesday dear, that was lovely. You're really improving. I think you're almost ready to start on the new piece I bought you. Dance of the Hyenas. That sounds pretty. Thank you, Lurch, that will be all. - Mother. Uncle Fester's sick. - Are you sure? When I saw him at breakfast this morning, his face fairly glowed with that lovely jaundiced color. Maybe he blew a fuse. Oh, darling, I'm sure he's funning you. He probably wants you to put a penny behind his ear to make him go again. I doubt that. No, his malady is a bit of a mystery. Children, why don't you go into the kitchen and help Grandmama sort the toadstools from the mushrooms. She's going to make a lovely toadstool soufflé. - Yummy! - Yummy! That reminds me, darling. If you're going to bake that cake I'll have to run out and get you a hand mixer. - Then Uncle Fester's really ill. - Not a watt. Oh, darling. I'm afraid this will cancel our outing for tomorrow. We could take flashlights. But the light would be too harsh. And too bright to explore new and unknown caves. Besides, when Uncle Fester switches to neon, the effect is truly spectacular. The children will be so disappointed. Little Wednesday was looking forward to collecting some new spiders. - You know how she adores her pets. - I know how you were looking forward to some hemlock seedlings for your garden. Darling, we're being very selfish. We're thinking of ourselves, and we shouldn't. We should only think of how to help Uncle Fester. How like you to think of it that way, querida mía. You are a gem. Tasty one, too. Darling, do you remember our second honeymoon at Niagara Falls? - In Niagara Falls. - It was a divine cave. Free showers, anytime of the day or night. That was living, mon ami. Tish. When you speak French you drive me wild. Speak some more French, Tish. Anything. Tout á I'heure. La plume de ma tante. Mademoiselle from Armentieres. Anything. - You are a devil. - Yes. I'm just gonna pack my bags and leave. Uncle Fester, what seems to be the trouble? Mama called me an outing pooper. - Oh, I'm sure she meant it kindly. - Of course. From Mama that's flattery. And that's not all. Thing refused to Indian wrestle with me. And the piranha fish wouldn't even take a bite out of my hand. That is unfriendly. It's worse than that. I asked Lurch to bring up my bed of nails so I could get some relaxation and he absolutely ignored me. We'll see about that. You rang? Lurch, I'm afraid you're going to have to apologize to Uncle Fester. That's better. Dear Lurch, he expresses himself so well. I don't blame anyone for rejecting me, the way I've ruined the family's outing. Uncle Fester, Gomez and I aren't rejecting you. - We want to help you. - But the question is how? I believe it has something to do with your diet. Impossible. I always eat a very simple, wholesome meal. Now, for breakfast this morning I had walnut shells and sour milk. Oh, you should have had green persimmons first. Naturally. Gosh. If there is something wrong with me, I hope it's one of those rare tropical diseases. You know, Morticia. Something glamorous. I hope so too, dear. But in the meantime, we must get you well before tomorrow. Oh, you better go along without me. I'll probably be an outing pooper. Well, back to the smog. Poor Uncle Fester. He sounds suicidal. At least he'll go with a clear sinus. Uncle Fester! Don't try to discourage me, Morticia. Uncle Fester, I've been thinking. Have you been getting enough moonshine? Morticia, you know I don't drink. Morticia's referring to moonbathing. The moon has marvelous restorative powers for us Addamses. Provided you don't take too much of it. There's a full moon out tonight. If I get too much I get freckles. Nonsense. A good moonbath is just the tonic you need. Well, I don't know about Uncle Fester, but you've talked me into one. Catch. You little minx. - Isn't this fun, Fester? - Oh, yes. But I'm not out here for fun. I'm out here to get my health back. I'd watch myself with that reflector the first time around. You should work up gradually to a nice coat of grey. Very wise, darling. Uncle Fester, would you like some of Mama's goose grease? Well, I had some. It was delicious. Uncle Fester, you're not supposed to eat it. - You're supposed to rub it on you. - Oh? Maybe that's why I don't feel any better. Oh, now on top of everything I've got myself a severe moonburn. Shucks. Oh, Gomez, you were a handsome little boy. - Darling, that's our son Pugsley. - Oh? You're right, I thought he looked familiar. Hello, Uncle Fester. You still alive? - Well, don't I look it? - Of course, darling. That moonbath did wonders for you. Don't let this outdoorsy, athletic exterior fool you. I feel rotten. Thing doesn't look so hot, either. He couldn't get past threesies four times in a row. I think there is something wrong with him. Thing, are you all right? Gomez, this is becoming serious. I think there maybe something contagious going around. You may be right. We'd better check Zelda. Zelda, dear, are you all right? She sounds fine. Gomez, isn't that sweet? She's molting. Beautiful. Zelda, darling, you're not eating your lunch. Dear, there is something wrong. She's not eating, and that's her favorite dish. Dry bones. Wouldn't eat her dried bones. This is serious. There's only one solution. We've got to call a doctor. A doctor? Which one? The only one. Our family witch doctor, Dr. Mbogo. Who did you want again? Oh, Dr. Mbogo. Wait a minute. I'll see if I can get a hold of him. Hold on. Tish, remind me to get myself a hollow log. Save a lot of time by dialing direct. They are taking a long time getting through, aren't they? Yes. Well, he's probably got a hut full of patients. Give old Doc a good tsetse fly bite case and he can't tear himself away. Hello? Doctor? Gomez Addams here. Jambo to you too, Doctor. Doctor, we're having a spot of trouble with Uncle Fester, and we'd appreciate it if you Really? Business is that good, eh? Well, if that's the way it is. Goodbye. What's the matter, dear? Dr. Mbogo isn't making any more house calls. Well, we're right back where we started from. Well, now what in the world are we going to do? I should've engaged that Pygmy witch doctor when I had the chance. He was reliable. Besides, he could travel for half fare. This really cancels our outing, doesn't it, Gomez? Well You mean I won't get to catch any spiders? I need some new ones. I know, darling. But we will go someday. MORTICIA: After all, Uncle Fester isn't feeling well. I'm an outing pooper. There's only one thing left for us to do. Tish, remember, please. Nothing rash. But I'm afraid the situation calls for it, dear. We'll have to call a regular doctor. Why, thank you, Thing. You're still very efficient. Darling, would you mind handing me the phone, please? - Certainly, my dear. - Thank you. I'll get it. - Dr. Milford. - This is Mrs. Addams. Addams. Yes. We have the house across the street and down the block from you. No, that's not empty. That's us. We call it our honeymoon cottage. Oh, yes, Mrs. Addams. Now I get you. What can I do for you? A member of our family is feeling a bit under and we wondered if you could stop by today? I'd be glad to. Thank you. Goodbye. You think we did the right thing? Darling, if this doctor proves inadequate, we'll send out West for a medicine man. Hello. Hello, little girl. This is the Addams house, isn't it? Are you the doctor that's going to cure Uncle Fester? Well, I'm certainly going to try my best. Where's your mask and spear? My what? The last doctor we had came like that. Yes, well This was the best I could do on the spur of the moment. I hope you can cure Uncle Fester. He can't even make the trains go. Trains? We haven't had a good wreck all day. So that's what a family doctor looks like. He certainly doesn't inspire confidence. Not like Dr. Mbogo. And I'm afraid I won't be able to settle his fee for a few painted beads, either. What's that little black bag he's carrying? I don't know, dear. But I'm sure, because it's black, it's something to help you. I don't think I'm gonna like him. The white hair and those glasses. How un-medical can he get? Dr. Milford. How do you do, Doctor? This is my lovely bride, Morticia. And this is our patient, Uncle Fester. I feel fine. Go away. I'm not going to harm you. I don't like quacks. You'll have to forgive him. MORTICIA: He's used to our old family doctor. But he's busy with his tribe. Oh. Wonderful doctor. Cured my pneumonia by dousing me with kerosene and pouring ashes over my head. Sometimes the old-fashioned remedies are best. Well, Doctor, would you like Mrs. Addams and me to leave? You're not gonna leave me alone with him. No. That won't be necessary. Not for the moment, at least. All right. Make yourself comfortable. Doctor Now if you'll just take off your coat, I can start my examination. I never take my coat off. I just couldn't. He's really very modest. Well, all right. I'll try and work around it. Sit right here, please. Fester. Right. My dear. Now open your mouth and say "ah. " This is most unusual. Your tongue is bright blue. Blue? It's supposed to be green. FESTER: I am sick. Don't worry, old boy. We'll pull you through. Just think about how nice it's going to be tomorrow this time. That's the only thing that's keeping me going. Hoping little Wednesday gets some nice Black Widows. Most unusual. Most unusual. Well, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take one arm out of your coat for this test. - Never! - But No! Very well. I'll try it over your sleeve. Most unusual. I daresay I'll have a paper for the medical journal from this one. Interesting patient, isn't he, Doctor? Unbelievable. He does have some unusual methods, doesn't he? Yes, indeed. I wish he'd shake his rattles or yell a few times as Dr. Mbogo does. Makes you feel like he's accomplishing something. Will you open the front of your coat, please? Of course not. Not in front of Morticia. I'll look the other way, Uncle Fester. Very well. What is it, Doctor? Don't spare us. What do you think? I think I'd better forget the medical journal. Contact Believe It or Not. I'd better take your temperature. GOMEZ: I took his pulse just before you got here. And? Well, either my watch has stopped or he's been dead for 20 minutes. He exaggerates so. I'm not so sure. Three below zero? By Jove, he's broken the family record. No wonder I felt a little bit chilly. I'd better close the windows. No, no, no, that can't be right. I'd better take another reading. It's very tasty. What have you done? I was so hungry Poor dear hasn't touched a thing all day. Even when he does eat he can't resist those between-meal snacks. May I use your phone? I'll have to alert the emergency hospital. Hey, Doc, you got another one of those things? Really hits the spot. The thermometer? Do you realize you've swallowed almost a full ounce of mercury? Well, it's a real picker-upper. Now he's beginning to look like his old self again. He is? Dr. Milford, you're a genius, an absolute genius. - I am? - I could kiss you. - Please. - That was a real medical coup. Pure mercury with Well, some of medical science's greatest discoveries have come about by accident. - Accident. Isn't he the modest one? - Yes. Doctor, before you go, we have one other patient we'd like for you to look at. Thing hasn't been feeling well at all lately. - Thing? - Yes. I'm all out of thermometers. Oh, you won't need a thermometer for Thing. This way. Thing, we have a surprise for you. Dr. Milford has cured Uncle Fester and now he wants to have a look at you. - What's the matter with him? - Maybe he caught what you had. Nonsense. He probably just remembered an appointment he has. Well, he won't be able to do much without his little black bag. Hey, these are tasty. You know, calling a family doctor is like having your own delicatessen. I suppose that lets out Dr. Mbogo. It certainly does. Unless it's something really serious. Darling, isn't it wonderful that Thing wasn't really sick? Just depressed over our having to cancel our outing. Quite so, cara mía. Thing always has the family's interests at heart. Back to your usual jolly yourself again, eh, Thing? Looks like you're planning something special for us, Uncle Fester. This will be the greatest family outing we've ever had. Watch. Bravo! Bravo, Uncle Fester. You've really outdone yourself this time. From now on, Uncle Fester, no more Christmas trees. We'll hang everything on you. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Lurch. When you finish there, I wish you'd milk Pugsley's octopus and shampoo Mama's alligator. Yes, Mrs. Addams. Oh, and when you make up our bed, Mr. Addams' pillow is getting soft again. I think you better add a dash of cement. Morticia, that mad music sets my warrior blood on fire. Oh, Gomez-san, my mongrel chieftain. That's Mongol. - That's enough for now, Lurch. - Yes, Mr. Addams. I don't want to wear you out. Lurch? The bed of nails needs filing. I want those points needle-sharp. Yes, Mr. Addams. When I stretch out on that thing, I want my pores to really open up. Dear Lurch. He just loves playing samurai with you. And he's so graceful at it, like a ballet dancer, isn't he? Good at concealing pain, too. You'd never guess he aches all over from that beating I just gave him. I'm a little worried about Lurch, though, darling. You think I overdid it this time? Took too much out of him? No, but I do think we're overworking the poor dear. We just work him day and night. All the rest of the time's his own. You know, I think Morticia's right, Gomez. There is an awful lot of work around this house. That boy ought to have help. Very well then, he shall have help. The best that money can buy. You mean you're gonna hire him an assistant? Hire? In this age of automation? I'm gonna build him one. Fester? Meet me in the playroom. And tell Pugsley to bring his Erector set. - Right. - Dr. Addams has work to do. Darling, you always come up with such practical solutions. This'll be another Addams first. I'll have the only custom-built second butler in town. Yeah. All the parts you wanted are right here on the operating table. Thank you, Fester. I'm working on the mechanical brain, Father. I'm going to make him talk and everything. - Good boy. - And I got all your tools ready. - Good man. - Thank you, Gomez. Well, have another look at the chart. The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone. The thigh bone's connected to the hip bone. The hip bone's connected to the backbone. Backbone connected to the neck bone. - And the head bone's up on top. - Good. - Wrench. - Wrench. - Pliers. - Pliers. - Screwdriver. - Screwdriver. Delicious. He sounds absolutely charming, Gomez. I can hardly wait to meet him. Where is he? Just waiting for us to call him, my dear. Pugsley, you may do the honors. You rang? Oh, he is splendid, Gomez. And what a fine, intelligent face. We taught him to obey spoken commands. Yeah. So anything you want him to do, you just tell him so. Smiley, go over there and brush the ashes off of Mr. Addams' coat. Wow. Isn't he the efficient one? - He can do everything Lurch can do. - Maybe even better. Not better. Certainly not better, Lurch. It's just that we know you've been working so hard lately. Mr. Addams thought you might like some help. Fester and Pugsley helped me build him for you, Lurch. This is Smiley, your assistant. Assistant? Pull the noose, Lurch. You rang? You see? With Smiley helping, you can take things a little easier, relax a bit. Not only that. You'll no longer be a plain butler, Lurch. Now, you'll be head butler. Head butler. - Well? - Good. Well, you chaps run off and get acquainted. Lurch here'll explain the work to you, Smiley. Follow me. - Head butler first. - Yes. Sir. Yes, sir. Better. Oh, dear Lurch. He's so pleased with his new helper. Always was a warm, friendly sort. - Your turn again. - Well, what's the score, Gomez? I believe I'm ahead Hey, it's really close this time. Darn, another near miss. I just peeked into the kitchen and saw Smiley washing the dishes for Lurch. Splendid. I hope his hands don't rust. I think this is the beginning of a whole new era around here. I sure hated the old one. With Smiley doing the menial tasks, Lurch will be free to do all those special favors we love so. The things that only Lurch can do. Nobody does a back scratch like Lurch. It's those talons of his. You rang? My back itches, Lurch. You know the spot. You rang? Scratch. The next time Gomez wants Smiley to scratch his back, he'd better wear armor. Smiley is a bit overanxious, but I think Lurch will train him. There, good as new. Where's Gomez? He's playing tug-of-war with Thing. Those two have fun together, don't they? Gomez, darling, be careful with him. Give up, Thing? I have you now. Better luck next time, Thing. Think I'll teach Thing samurai. Not getting much competition from Lurch. Morticia, where's Lurch? I suppose he's teaching Smiley the household chores. Why? Is something wrong, dear? Well, my head needs waxing. Oh, yes. It is beginning to get a little scruffy and dull-Iooking. You're right. You rang? Wax job for Uncle Fester's head, Lurch. You rang? Wax job, Uncle Fester's head. Yes, sir. I wanted Lurch to put it on. He does it so nice and smooth. Now, patience, Uncle Fester. You must give Smiley a chance. He's gotta learn to work if he's gonna take the load off Lurch. I don't mind him taking the load off of Lurch, but he's taking the skin off of me. Busy with your art again, eh, my dear? Yes. I'm doing a portrait from one of our old snapshots. Good old Cousin Crimp. I'll never forget him. Or her, either. They were such fun on a double date, weren't they? Mighty handy when we needed a third or a fourth for bridge, too. Well, you go on with your work. I'm gonna take a little bounce on the trampoline here. Loosen up my muscles. I love a man with loose muscles. Alley-oop! That nearly loosened my teeth. You rang? Would you mind tightening up the trampoline, old man? Seems to have lost its bounce. Yes, Mr. Addams. You rang? Tighten, more bounce. Yes, sir. Very capable, Lurch. Seems to be learning quickly. Tightened. Alley-oop! Well, as long as I'm upstairs, I think I'll lie down and take a nap. Oh, I'll have to try that. It can be tiring walking up those stairs. There's mother's baby. It was the worst breakfast I ever ate. Lurch should be ashamed of himself. Lurch didn't cook breakfast, Mama, Smiley did. Lurch was much too tired. Oh, the mail's in. Thank you, Mama. And thank you, Thing. - Darling. - Thank you, my dear. Occupant, occupant, occupant. Dear, do we know anyone named occupant? We're always getting mail for those people. Send it back. Say, here's interesting news. Says national fitness week begins today. How nice. I think I'll start with one of those invigorating rubdowns Lurch used to give me. Oh, that would be nice for you, dear. Relax you and improve your muscle tone. Yes, I need it. My muscle tone is terrible. Yes, it is. Perhaps Lurch can get you back in tune. You rang? A rubdown, Lurch. Meet you in the playroom. Yes, Mr. Addams. You mean he sent Smiley to give you a massage? I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Better make that my back. I'm wondering if Smiley wasn't a big mistake. But he's such a perfect dear. He's ruining a good butler. Can't get a lick of work out of Lurch now. He has the robot doing everything. Oh, darling, Lurch is just going through a phase. He'll get over it. He will, but I won't. After all, dear, you did build Smiley so that Lurch could take it easy. Tish! French! Speak some more. Darling. Lurch now, "ooh-la-la" later. Later. - Where were we? - Lurch. Oh, yes, Lurch. You're right. I've been unreasonable about him. From now on, I'll insist that he relax and enjoy himself. Good. He's such a shy, sensitive soul. I'm sure if he thought you were displeased, he'd be miserable. Probably off somewhere now, worrying himself sick. - You rang? - Going for a walk. - Get my good suit. - Yes, sir. Darling, why don't you call poor Lurch and reassure him? Capital idea. Smiley, shoes. I've been yanking on this bell for 20 minutes. Why doesn't Lurch answer? You want me to go up to his room and see if he's dead or something? If he's resting we shouldn't disturb him, and if he's dead there's no point to it. Irrefutable logic, my dear. - Oh, Lurch, how nice you look. - You going for a stroll, old man? My constitutional. Excellent idea. You look better already. Keep it up, Lurch. Don't worry about a thing, we're getting along fine. Better than ever. Than ever? Back soon. There's no need to hurry. Stay out as long as you like. Have yourself a good dinner downtown and see a nice movie, Dracula and the Wolfman. Have yourself a few laughs. Yes, do. We really don't need you at all. Don't need me? - Not a bit. - That Smiley is terrific. Now, you run along and have some fun. Changed mind. Work. - Querida. - Darling. Oh, my favorite flowers. Nothing is quite as festive as a vase of chrysanthemums. The blooms are so large this year. Superb. You were born with a green thumb. Really? Must have been very attractive. I'm sorry we couldn't talk Lurch into taking the evening off. We must insist on it. Told Smiley to keep these cigars lighted. - You rang. - You rang. A light, Smiley. I was addressing Smiley, Lurch. You've been working too hard. Relax, get some rest. Smiley'll take care of the work. Thank you, Smiley. - Consolidated just hit 175. - Really? What did you pay for it, dear? Two hundred and seventy-five. It's the best I've done all year. How exciting. Darling, would you move my chair over here? I'd like to watch you. - You rang. - You rang. I rang for Smiley, Lurch. Smiley, will you move Mrs. Addams' chair over here, please? Yes, sir. That will be all, Lurch. Yes, Mrs. Addams. You're to go upstairs and lie down and take a nap. Do you understand? Who'll cook dinner? Smiley will cook dinner this evening. Now, you're to take a long rest. And don't come back until we call for you. And, Lurch, that's an order. Bravo, Gomez. You're a born saboteur. It was all right. Darling, you always love a good, crunching wreck. Is something wrong? Well, I have a little indigestion. Smiley's dinner wasn't quite up to snuff. Yes, he isn't half the cook Lurch is. That roast aardvark was rather disappointing. It didn't even look good. Can you imagine, a roast aardvark without an apple in its mouth? It's like It's like a martini without the egg. Oh, darling, please. I know what you need. Why don't you have a go at your sword swallowing. That always settles your stomach. I give up. Now, now, darling, you must learn to be a good loser. I'm winning. But it's no fun. Smiley can't cheat like Lurch. I taught Lurch everything he knows about cheating. Now, darling, nobody's perfect. Smiley's doing his best. Right. I'm sure we can all put up with a little inconvenience for Lurch's sake. Is he still resting? He's been up in that room for three hours now. Calm, relaxed Finally at peace with himself. Smiley wants my job. They like him best. Pile of tin junk! It's unfair. Thank you, Thing. I'm through. Finished. What can I do? You're a real friend, Thing. Gung ho, my lord and master. Samurai time again, darling? Yes, but it won't be much fun without Lurch. But he has to get his rest. I'll teach Smiley. Smiley! You rang? No, Smiley, I called. I'm gonna make an ancient Japanese warrior out of you, Smiley. - First thing I want you to do - No! Follow me. Isn't that sweet? I don't think Lurch is jealous of Smiley anymore. He probably wants to play with him. Well, this house always has bred peace and harmony. - What was that noise all about? - And where's Smiley? Resigned. Well, Gomez darling, it's been a long day. I think I'll go upstairs to bed. Be right up, my dear. One more round on the trampoline and it's beddy-bye. Don't be long, darling. Oh, Lurch, look at this thing. It needs tightening again. Yes, Mr. Addams. Good thing Smiley's not tightening that for you. You almost went into orbit after he fixed it. Well, Smiley was only a robot, Fester. When something needs a really delicate adjustment, Lurch is the only one I trust with it. Thank you, Mr. Addams. - Fixed. - Thank you, Lurch. Alley-oop. Gomez Yes, the trampoline. Well, darling, as you always say, - this is the age of automation. - Querida 
We're off! Morticia, why are you sitting there? I'm all dressed. Lurch is waiting outside in the car. We're all set. - We are? - But this is the night we look forward to all year. The night the bats come back to Capistrano. - Give them my regards. - Dear, this is our great fun night. - Listen. - Fun, fun, fun. - There's more to life than just fun. - There is? A person must contribute something to the world. I contribute plenty. Have you seen my tax bills? Darling, you don't understand. I want to do something creative. My dear, you are creative. You are a creative mother, a creative cook. - And above all, a creative lover. - Pish-tosh. What does that all add up to? I'll tell you what it all adds up to. It adds up to la dolce vita. Not bad, eh? Gomez, listen to me, a life must have some fulfillment. I want to do something artistic, that the world will remember. Life is not all lovely thorns and singing vultures, you know. You could develop a new strain of henbane, like Luther Burbank. Take some grapes and cross them with poison oak. No, darling, I'm tired of breeding plants. Look, I crossed daffodils with roses, and what did I get? - More petals. - Dress designer. No one knows more about fashion than you, my dear. Oh, sweet Gomez. But am I not more than merely a seamstress? Yes, it should be something big, like Madame Curie, Louis Pasteur, Bluebeard, Michelangelo. Michelangelo, that's it. He was a painter, and then a sculptor. - I am a painter, and now - That's right! - All you need is a hammer and chisel. - And a rock. - Oh, I can hardly wait to get started. - Neither can I. Ready? Lurch? Right this way, Lurch. Good man. Good Careful on the steps. That's it. Right over here, now. Don't drop it or Mrs. Addams will have her studio in the basement. There we are. Thank you, Lurch. Fester, have you got the hammer and chisel? Here they are, but it's only a loan. I need them for my correspondence course. - Correspondence course? In what? - Brain surgery. Where is the discus? Thank you, Thing. Ready, querida. Oh, it's gorgeous. Rock, rock, beautiful rock. I got it for you myself, knowing that only you could do justice to it. I think I'll do an abstract. Well, then we'll get Cousin Vague to pose for you. He's about as abstract as you can get. Oh, no, darling. For an abstract, I'm going to do it right out of my own little head. - Now, sponge. - Sponge. - Hammer. - Hammer. - Chisel. - Chisel. Already, I feel like a different woman. By george, Morticia, what wonders you've accomplished in a short three months. It does have a certain je ne sais quoi. Tish, that's French. You know it drives me wild. Darling, you almost made me ruin my masterpiece. Oh, sorry. Now, then. I'm right in the middle of that left eye. Perfect! No, that was the whole eye. Luckily, he has three. Come and get it. Lunch break. - When are you gonna start? - Start? - Uncle Fester, I'm almost finished. - Fester, don't be a clod. - Don't you know art when you see it? - I know a rock when I see it. Oh, it was ever thus. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. - Perhaps you're standing too close. - Yes, why don't you back up a bit. How's it now? - Well? - Well Hey, from here it looks great. Well, darling, what do you think? Leonardo da Vinci never did anything like that. Oh, I wonder what Mr. Bosley Swain will say. Being the city's leading art critic, what else can he say, but Just a moment, Bosley. If you have any suggestions, speak up. Well, as a matter of fact, I do have a suggestion. Bore a hole in it, put in a few sticks of dynamite - and blow it sky-high. - Is that your final word? No, I have one more. Goodbye. Darling, what did Mr. Swain say? He was too overcome with emotion to discuss it, but he did show a lot of feeling. That's a most wonderful compliment. My, you are a nervous one today. Why don't you just tell Morticia she's a flop? And break her fragile little heart? What do you take me for, Fester? A Rasputin? We must convince her somehow that statue's a success. Somebody must be interested enough to buy it. All right, I'll buy it. No, I haven't got a dime. Why don't you buy it? For a stupid suggestion, Fester, that's positively brilliant. I'll hire some broken-down art-dealer to buy it. I'll put up the money, Morticia will be delighted, the money goes back in the bank, and everybody's happy. For a brilliant idea, that's pretty stupid. Where're you gonna find an art dealer that's crummy enough to do a thing like that? Simple, I'll hire Sam Picasso, the crummiest art dealer in America. - Shapeless mess? - Look deeper, that's an abstract. That I have seen better abstract made by a chain gang. I'm not asking you to criticize it, Picasso, just buy it. Not even with your money. Don't you understand? I will not sell my soul. There'll be a $200 fee. At those prices I like a man with integrity. I wish I knew one. Now, there's your $200. Plus $50,000 to buy the statue. You keep all of your money in the drawer? Just petty cash. Big stuff's upstairs in the mattress. Mr. Picasso, my husband's been telling me about you. That's a lie. I run an honest gallery. My dear, Mr. Picasso was just telling me how much he likes your statue. Oh? Ah, yes, "A thing of beauty is a joy forever. " That's Keats. Now tell me, how much do you like my statue? Picasso, start with a reasonable offer, or the deal's off. That's an idea. Come back here and face this like a man. My dear, Mr. Picasso has just had a change of heart. He remembers he has a rich buyer. Undoubtedly a man of exquisite taste. All right, let's get it settled. All right, $50,000? That's a nice round figure. - It's a steal. - Petty larceny. - Your money, senora. - Thank you. Please excuse me. - What's going on in here? - Morticia just sold her statue. - Well, how about that? - Yes, and now I'll have to name it. Let's see I think I'll call it Miracle of the Ages. Like from the Stone Ages. Well, I'll take the $50,000, my dear. That mattress could use a little stuffing. Oh, no, darling, I earned this money with my own hands. And I'm going to use it to help aspiring artists like myself. Morticia, that's ridiculous! I mean, you're not gonna give them $50,000? Why, of course not. This is just the first installment. From now on, every penny I make goes to help starving art students. Darling. What are you gonna do now, moneybags? What any level-headed man would do. Shoot myself. Clatsworthy, you're my business manager. Of course you can speak freely. Well, not that freely. So my bank account's overdrawn. Who cares? It makes my wife happy. It makes the bank unhappy? I'll just have to raise some more cash. But I'll tell you one thing, Clatsworthy. I'm changing banks. I don't like dealing with spoilsports. I'll say one thing about Morticia, she's got drive and she's quite a chiseler. Enough to drive me to bankruptcy. I'm being forced to dispose of some of my most valuable assets. My game preserve in Nairobi. Bamboo plantation in Bali. What hurts most of all, a savings and loan in Siberia. You'd better call Blooker the broker and have him dispose of my Consolidated Fuzz. You know, if you were smart, you'd hold on to your Consolidated Fuzz - and sell your AT&T. - It's not just the prices she's getting from Picasso, it's the cost of all that rock. What's that thing she's making in there now? Can't you tell? It's the head of a dinosaur. - Or is it the foot? - How many has she sold? I've lost count. You broke it. - Mr. Picasso? - Well, of course. You were expecting some bum? Follow me. And if you will behave yourself, I might give you a very big tip. Mr. Picasso. You're just in time to view my latest work. Senora, I can hardly wait. I call it Motherhood. Why not? When this will be displayed, all the mothers in the world will be after you After it. Oh, then you think it's worth something? $30,000 if it's worth a nickel. I just won't sell it for more than $2,000. I have finished several others. Then for this one I will give you $40,000. Not a penny more than $3,000. I call this My Afternoon of an Evening. I couldn't bear to part with it for less than $45,000. It's a bargain. Those starving artists must be eating better than I am. And this is my master masterpiece. I call it World War II. - $80,000? - $75,000. How about that? You saved $5,000. - Throw them in the truck with the others. - Where are you taking them? The Tip Top Quarry. You know they pay me $30 a ton. Those scoundrels! I buy my rocks at Tip Top and they charge me $100 a ton. But I return the rocks damaged. Speaking of money, Senor Gomez, you know, I will be needing some, if you want me to buy more of the masterpieces. - Can't you bargain a little? - You want me to insult an artist? - That's no artist, that's my wife. - It's only money. Well, Gomez, so far you're batting zero. Never mind my batting average, it's my bank balance that's falling so fast. - It's time I put an end to all this. - You're gonna tell Morticia the truth? Exactly. But first I'm gonna tell her a few more lies. - Do hurry, Lurch. I must get back to work. - Yes, Mrs. Addams. You're a very good grinder, Lurch, almost as good as Mama. Dear Mama. Her great-great-great- grandmother sharpened guillotines. Dear old Great-Great-Grandmother Slice. The belle of the French Revolution. Oh, Gomez, you're just in time. May I, dear? Anything. - Well, back to work. - Morticia, wait. Wait? When art is calling? Well, you can't keep up this mad pace. Look at yourself in the mirror. Pale, wan, sunken-cheeked. Yes, sculpting does agree with me. Believe me, you're working yourself to death. Well, then, my prices will go up. Look at it another way. You're flooding the market. Darling, Mr. Picasso doesn't seem to think so. He keeps paying bigger and bigger prices everyday. Even he's going to run out of money sooner or later, and a lot sooner than later. You worry too much, bubele. - But the way things are going, I - Gomez, I called you bubele. Oh, yes. Still drives me wild. Darling, chisel now. Bubele later. Lurch, have you ever been on relief? Ruined? No, not if we make you a one-armed thinker. Just sort of put it behind your back. Yes, that's much better. Oh, dear. May I? Yes, that's much better. Now, I just have to remove that piece of thumb from your chin. I think I got a bit too much. May I? It just keeps improving. Now, hold still while I give it the final touch. Lurch, I think I've really hit on something. Good night, Mrs. Addams. Well, good night, Lurch. We'll work on it again in the morning. Morticia, it's 3:00 in the morning. Wonderful. - I still have four hours of nightlight left. - But aren't you coming to bed? Oh, darling, how can I sleep knowing that somewhere there's a stone uncut. - How about a husband uncuddled? - Noble Gomez. It's not like you to think of yourself when I'm in the throes of creation. But the whole house has changed! We never dance anymore, or Well, dance, darling. Go right ahead, dance to your heart's content. Alone? Querida Why don't you call Mama? She's always ready for an old-fashioned cha-cha-cha. With all these rocks around, there's not even room for a cha. Darling, you're right. I have been selfish. - You mean you're gonna give up sculpting? - Oh, nonsense. Since I'm crowding you here, I'm going to find myself a lovely garret. - A garret? - Of course. You can visit me on weekends. Pugsley! Wednesday! Darling, your children are here to see you. Hello, children. Poor little things. You haven't seen your mother in days, have you? Sure we've seen her. She's been right there chopping on those rocks. How true. You little youngsters, feeling Ionely and neglected, you've come to plead with your mother to come back to you. No, we were just on our way to the kitchen. Do you hear that? Not only Ionely and neglected, but starving, too. Starving? Nonsense, darling, there's plenty of cold yak in the refrigerator. Querida, it's 3:00 in the morning. Oh, yes, cold yak might upset their stomachs. Heat it up, dear. Children, tell your mother what it's been like, the last few days without her. - We've been having a ball. - We've been staying up all night. Oh? Well, just make sure you sleep late in the morning. Darling, they can't sleep late in the morning, they have to go to school. - We haven't been to school in days. - Do you hear that? - They haven't been to school in days. - But, Father, it's vacation. Come on, Pugsley, let's go in the kitchen and finish the fudge. Little darlings. Fudge? Gadzooks! Is she going to sculpt in the kitchen, too? Wednesday, Pugsley, what are you doing? Will you look at what's cooking in that pot? Chocolate-marshmallow fudge! Where did you pick up that habit? Children, what do you have to say for yourselves? - We're sorry. - Have you ever tried fudge? - Don't be insolent. - Off to bed, this minute. Go on, scoot, scoot, scoot. Go on. Oh, Gomez, fudge. I have been neglecting the children. - From now on, I'm turning in my chisel. - No! No, don't try to talk me out of it. My mind's made up. I'm going back to the most important role a woman can have. - Lover. - Mother. - Oh, that. - And lover. You rang? Lurch, clear those rocks out of the living room. We're going to dance till dawn! - Do I hear music? - Yes. You know when I told you to call Blooker the broker and sell? I thought you said buy. Did I get you in a jam? You certainly did, tax-wise. That stock went up 50 points. I made $600,000. Wonderful. Now I can buy back all my lovely statues. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -Lovely day, isn't it? -Yes. The chill goes right through you. Look at them. Oh, they have such good times together. -Well, here we are. -Is this the Addams house? Yep. Are you sure this is the place you wanna go to? Why, yes. Okay. You know, it's not too Iate. I could still take you back into town and turn you over to those Travelers Aid. -No, thank you. -Okay, Iady. I wonder who that could be? It may not be a who. It may be a what. You optimist. A relative. -Morticia? It's me. -Cousin Melancholia! Oh, darling! Gomez, you remember Melancholia. Who could forget that face? I know I should have called, but everything happened so fast. -Everything? -It's Fred. -My intended. -He jilted you. Well, I can't really say. He just took back his ring, sold his farm and joined the Foreign Legion. That is kind of indefinite. I just didn't know what to do. I'm glad you came to us in your hour of trial. And you remember Mama? I always said that you'd grow up to be a beauty. Oh, Mama, you haven't changed a bit. And you haven't Iost a bit of your Iooks. The vain old thing takes hours to get herself together. It certainly shows. Darling, why don't you go upstairs and freshen up and we'II talk it all over Iater. Follow me. MELANCHOLIA: Oh. It's so good to be where you feel at home. I'd better make her a nice hot cup of henbane juice. MORTICIA: Thank you, Mama. Gomez, is there anything we can do to help Melancholia? Well, if we can't help her, who can? -We have to find her a man. -But where? Darling, you have so many vast business interests, you must know someone. Well, Iet's see now. There's old Charlie Carlisle the accountant. -No, he's dead. -He wouldn't be right. Melancholia needs someone dashing, handsome, charming. Like you, darling. Carinito, you're really making it tough. Now, now, now, CIeopatra, you're much too young to take tea. GOMEZ: Yes, indeed. That's right. Mmm-hmm. Well, she'd make a perfect wife. Yes, I see. Uh-huh. Well, then, it's obvious I have the wrong number. -Any Iuck? -Seven refusals. Fortunately, three of them were wrong numbers. We just have to keep trying. What about Ed Franzen, the fellow who works at the monument company? -Much too flighty. -You're right. Even when he's carving those inscriptions he can't stop giggling. -Darling, have you tried your salt mine? -No, by Jove! They used to have a pretty Iively crowd down there. I just know this is gonna work. It's got to, I'm running out of companies. Hello? Sutton? Addams here. Say, we've got a ravishing young cousin here who's just dying for some company. Oh, well, thanks anyway. Keep the salt rolling. -Nothing? -Nothing. But don't despair, we'II find someone. -How about a marriage broker? -Capital idea! I know just the one. Hasty Marriage. The same one we got for Cousin Gripe. Hasty Marriage? How are you fixed for grooms? Really? He says they've got a complete selection. How romantic. Tell them to send over a few, and then Melancholia can take her pick. How about sending over a few samples? Oh, you know, one tall, one short, one fat, one thin. Better make that two thins. The name is Addams. Hello? Hello? I think we were disconnected. It's just as well. I think we should get one of our own. You're right, we should. -Lurch. -Oh, dear, not Lurch. -He's such a playboy. -That's all an act. You'II see. You rang? Lurch, have you ever given thought to the blissful joys of marriage? You see? Underneath that devil-may-care, he's a sentimental softie. Lurch, we have a Iovely girl for you. Sweet, soft and soulful. I thought you wanted him for Melancholia. I'm talking about Melancholia. Now, now, Lurch, control yourself. You mustn't appear overanxious. Now, about the wedding date. -Obviously he prefers a Iong engagement. -Nonsense. Two people so ideally suited. Why wait? -How about eloping tonight? -PIease. Well, it is a bit hasty. How about tomorrow night? We'II all go together. We'II make it a combination elopement and picnic. Darling, somehow I don't think Lurch takes to the idea of an elopement. AII right, forget the elopement, we'II just go on the picnic. It's a Iovely idea! But I do believe Melancholia would rather be married. No. By Jove, Morticia, I'm beginning to believe you were right. He is a playboy. Very well, Lurch, you may go. But, remember, there will never be another Melancholia. Never. They would have made a Iovely couple. I just Iove weddings. They always make me cry. Oh, thank you, Thing. Thing? Have you ever given thought to the blissful joys of marriage? The Things of today. Forget it. I think Melancholia would prefer a professional man. A doctor. Or a Iawyer. HARVEY: No, no, no. Not me. I will not go back to that Addams house, never. But a deal Iike this. Think of your wife and children. -I have no wife and children. -Then think of mine. -This deal could mean millions. -Not worth it. Come on now, Harvey, you have to. This is the chief reason I brought you back into the firm. You're the only Iawyer in our office who's had any contact with them. I would rather have contact with a nest of scorpions. Oh, come on, now. So the family is a Iittle eccentric. The point is we have a job to do. If it means going back to that house, I am not going to do it. What am I asking you to do? An important client wants something Addams has. AII you have to do is go over there and discuss it with him. Go on, make an appointment. I knew I could depend on you. Mr. Addams, please. Oh, he's not home? The whole family's gone on a world cruise? The whole family's gone on a world cruise. Try it now. First I need a good stiff drink. It's no use, I can't find a man anywhere. Oh, poor Melancholia. Doomed to spinsterhood. Oh, Melancholia, darling, we were just talking about you. -I know. Nobody wants me. -Oh, what nonsense. No. I'm cursed. Fred isn't the first tragedy in my Iife. I got as far as the altar with EImer. -What happened? -I got there but EImer didn't. -He just ran off. -Foreign Legion? -South America. -That is better climate. Well, darling, it's obvious. They felt unworthy. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Addams speaking. Oh, hello, Mr. Harvey. Just a moment. Darling, it's that nice young Iawyer, Mr. Harvey. He wants to talk to you. Not now, this is all too disturbing. Mr. Harvey, I'm afraid Mr. Addams can't come to the phone right now. He's involved in a Iittle family problem. Oh, I see. Well, I'm sure an old bachelor Iike myself can't be of any help. Bye. It's no use. He didn't even get on the phone. Your problem is solved. -Mama! What in the world? -Love dust. Don't you remember? Worked wonders for you and Gomez. Oh, of course. How thoughtful of you, Mama. -It'II bring the men howling. -Are you sure? Well, we'd better use a double dose. -There, that ought to do it. -Thank you, Mama. What's so funny? -Gomez, she's crying. -Oh. Darling, don't you worry, we'II find you a man. You may have to Iower your standards a bit. Oh, I feel just awful bothering you two. And interfering with your business. -You probably offended that man. -Oh, no, Mr. Harvey's very understanding, -even though he is a bachelor. -Yes, he's a very -Bachelor! -Bachelor! Yes? Oh, of course. Mr. Addams. -Look, I don't want to impose. -Impose? My dear fellow, to you the Addams home is Liberty Hall. It's just a Iittle business matter. -Excellent. PIan to stay all evening. -Thank you. -Well, how does it Iook? -Wonderful. Mr. Harvey is a very suave, sophisticated man. So Iet's get rid of these homey things, shall we? You can wear anything of mine that you Iike. Oh, they're gorgeous! -Oh, Cousin Morticia, you're too generous. -Darling, what's family for? Now come along to the mirror. I want to pluck your eyebrows. When I finish with you you won't recognize yourself. -Is Mr. Harvey a real good friend of yours? -Oh, yes. He's a Iittle bit shy and reserved. I'm afraid you'II have to take him in hand. In both hands. Are you sure he'II come? He's probably dying to come. They're not home. Well, some other time. Harvey, old man! -So good to see you again. -Nice to be back. -Lurch, a drink for our friend. -Oh, thank you, I'm not thirsty. Nonsense, it's something special. The Vat '68. Look, Mr. Addams, I don't wanna take up your time. I know you're a very busy man. But all we want is an option on an itty-bitty, worthless piece of African Iand you've got. Worthless? With all those fine subterranean bat caves? Come, come, Harvey, you're not talking to a child. Here we are. Superb. -Really, I don't want any of that. -PIease, Harvey, I never drink alone. Besides, you Iook as though you can use a drink. You must've had a pretty hard day. Oh, the day was all right. It's the night. -Well, drink up, there's plenty more. -I'II bet. It really hits the spot. Harvey, you're not drinking. Wait. Now we have something to drink to. To the Iadies. Ever seen two Iovelier girls? I know the one on the right is your wife. But what is Who's the other one? That's Mrs. Addams' cousin, Melancholia. You Iike her? -Oh, yes, she's Iovely. -Good. She's your date. -Am I dead? -Of course not, silly. Oh, too bad. -Where are the others? -They thought we'd Iike to be alone. I don't know about we, but I would. -I've got to put something in my car. -Something in your car? -What? -Me. Out for a Iittle air, old man? This has been a rather heady experience. -You gave us quite a scare. -I gave you a scare? I thought I was gonna be a widow before I was a bride. -I beg your pardon? -Melancholia does that to a man. But don't you worry about it. You'II feel a Iot better when you get some food in your stomach. Mama is cooking up a real surprise. I am so hungry I could eat a wolf. Gomez, you guessed it! Superb dinner. That belladonna sauce really brings out the flavor. -You didn't eat much, Harvey. -The excitement. Love is that way. I suddenly felt all chilled and goosebumpy, too. Well, a Iittle bicarb and you'II be fine. Would you two Iovebirds Iike to dance? -No, thank you. -Love to. Only first I have to fix my face. Now, if you'II just Iook over these contracts What was that? Love dust. Mama is an incurable romantic. AII she ever thinks about is Iove, Iove, Iove. Well, all I ever think about is business, business, business. Excellent, a woman needs a good provider. Especially Melancholia. She's a bit extravagant, I'm afraid. But she's so much in Iove she's about to burst. Well, that would solve everything. I mean, your cousin's a Iovely girl. Too Iovely for just one man. So why don't I call you tomorrow? We can talk over the deal on the phone. -You wanted something, sir? -Just out. Oh, nonsense, the evening is just getting underway. -I'm back. -You see? Oh, Melly. You Iight up the room. I am sure you and Melancholia have Iots of things to talk about. So why don't you just sit down? But watch him, Melly darling, he's a charmer. -He's one of our most dashing bachelors. -Is that nice, Mr. Harvey? When did you decide to become a bachelor? Just tonight. Now, about this deal My! You're a jumpy one. Mr. Addams, it seems they've discovered oil on your game preserve in Nairobi. -Did you say oil? -Oh, just a few drops. Oh, Gomez, Mr. Harvey doesn't want to talk about any old oil. But I do, I do! Oh, I can't wait to hear him say that to a preacher. -Now, if you'II just sign right here -I have to think about it, Harvey. After all, I do owe something to the bats. But we don't want all of it. Just one teeny Iittle well. Oh, Gomez, give it to him. Nairobi's such a romantic place. Those Iovely nights with the hyenas howling. Makes a perfect spot for a honeymoon. You're so right, Mrs. Addams, you really have a good business -Honeymoon? Whose honeymoon? -Why, yours and Melancholia's. -Provided she accepts your proposal. -I accept. -Welcome to the family, old man. -But No buts. I'II take these into the Iibrary and Iook them over. In the meantime, you two can go in the conservatory and make your plans. We'II drink a toast to the bride and groom. You rang? Champagne for the newlyweds, Lurch. Mr. Addams, maybe I better go with you and explain some of those clauses. And Ieave your Iove-starved Iittle dream girl all alone? -Nonsense. -But Don't they make a handsome couple? He's a man, she's a woman. Perfect match. Hard to believe we just met. This whole evening has been pretty unbelievable. -Don't you think it's fate? -No. Just my Iuck. Oh, what a Iovely thing to say! -Kiss me. -Kiss you? You don't want me to tell Gomez you're afraid, do you? No, no, please, Iet's keep him out of this. Well, then. Kiss me. I'II keep my eyes closed. -Is it all right if I close mine, too? -Of course, silly. Oh, no! You are a bashful boy. Maybe this will cure you. I just Iove weddings, don't you, darling? Mmm-hmm. -They're so romantic. -Out of my way. -AII right, where is she? -Who are you? Gomez Addams here. Never mind that, where's Melancholia? Fred. I thought you'd joined the Foreign Legion. Not the Foreign Legion, you rock-head. The American Legion. -But, dear, you took the ring back. -I had to. Your finger was turning green. -I brought you a nice brass one. -Oh, thank you! Oh, Ralph, this is my fiance, Fred. Fred, this is my fiance, Ralph. You mean I'm gonna have to fight for you? -Oh, no, no. -Okay. This is so romantic. Come on. Thanks for the hospitality. Well! Oh, Mr. Harvey? Mr. Harvey. Wake up. Wake up, Mr. Harvey. -Am I still alive? -Very much. And here are the signed papers. You've got a deal. Don't you worry about that ungrateful Melancholia. I've got Iots of cousins. I have to get this nice and clean for Pugsley. -What is it? A telescope? -An African blowgun. That reminds me. Do you miss Melancholia? No, indeed, my dear, I'm glad she's gone. Ungrateful wench. Now, now, remember blood is thicker than water. Thank heaven. She certainly wasn't the right girl for Harvey. -He's a nice man, isn't he? -Yes, indeed. I ought to give him more of my Iegal business. I think that's an excellent idea. Why don't you call him? I think I'II do that. There. It's all finished. What do you think, darling? Do you think Uncle Crimp will Iike his new sweater? I hope so. Looks Iike a perfect fit. Mr. Harvey, please. Oh, I see. He's Ieft town. -For Iong? -I'm afraid so. He's joined the Foreign Legion. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Mama! I didn't know there was anyone down here in the playroom. I just came down here to relax. Uncle Fester! I see you're relaxing, too. Very sensible. Something the matter with that door. -You rang? -This door wants attention, Lurch. Dear Uncle Fester, is there anything I can do for you? No, I'm very comfortable. This feels so good. Thank you, Lurch. That's much better. I just Iove creaky doors. We both thought we'd rest up a bit before going on our spider hunt. That reminds me, have you seen Iittle Pugsley's octopus? It's been running all over the house. Aristotle! That animal's just plain spoiled. I know, Mama, but you know how children are with their pets. That's not right, Morticia. Children need discipline. I know, Mama, but they also need Iove. That's why I Ieft Gomez and Pugsley alone upstairs. They need some time together. You know, father and son. Father, could I go to the circus? What's come over you, Son? Why would a healthy American boy wanna go to the circus? What was that thing you got yourself involved with Iast week? -The Boy Scouts? -Oh, yeah. The Boy Scouts. -This week it's a circus. -I'm sorry, Father. Well, just this once, mainly because he happens to be a friend of mine. The gorilla? No, the owner of the circus, Oscar Webber. I'd rather know Gorgo. I've got Iots of people friends, but I don't know one gorilla. Oscar was a sword-swallower when I first met him. "Oscar, the Human Knife-Nibbler. " That's a nice name, but I'd still rather know Gorgo. He'd make a wonderful pet. You're right. I'II have Lurch get the car ready. We'II have a grand old time. We Addamses always had a way with gorillas. You rang? The car, Lurch. I'm taking Pugsley to the circus. Thanks, Father. Gomez? You simply must do something about that bell. Lurch says he can hardly hear it. Morticia, I'm taking Pugsley to the circus. Do you really think you should? I mean, after all, I'd feel a Iot better if he was home playing in his bat cave. This circus can't be so bad. It's Oscar Webber. You remember Oscar. Oscar Webber, of course. But what in the world is he doing with a circus? -He owns this one. -Lovely. You know, I'II never forget the wonderful times we had when we double-dated with him and his girl. What was her name? That Irish girl with the pictures all over her. Tattoo Ralloo Raloora, the IIIustrated Colleen. That's the one. I especially Ioved the one that Picasso did on her chest. Well, you two run along and have fun. I must say it'II be especially Ionely here with the others off on a spider hunt. I feel so guilty running out on you, Tish. Oh, darling, don't. I'II be busy with my plants. My coniferons, bless them. They're eating Iike pigs. Especially since I switched them from pot roast to hamburger. Say, why don't you invite some neighbors in? I would Iike to have that Iovely Miss Magruder. You know, the one with the beautiful hatchet face. This is Mrs. Magruder. Mrs. Addams! The woman in that strange house. She wants to join the Ladies' League. Heavens. -Inviting us to tea. -Think we should? We are on a membership drive. We'II be delighted. Oh, yes, we know the house. The one that Well, it does Iook sort of haunted. Why, thank you! And thank you, Thing. There, that wasn't so difficult, was it? Darling, being married to you makes me the world's most fortunate woman. You always were so frank. -GOMEZ: Ready, Pugsley? -Be right down! Just want to get some money out of my piggy bank, Father! Whew! Ready. Ready. Look who we're going to see, Mother. The mighty Gorgo. -My, he is a handsome fellow. -Yeah. GOMEZ: Business really Iooks bad for Mr. Webber. There he is! I'm going over to find Mr. Webber. You go play with the gorilla. I just couldn't wait to see you, Oscar. How Iong have you owned the circus? I bought it three years ago. But this past season, everything's gone wrong. The fat Iady fell in Iove. Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. -Lost 240 pounds. -That could be noticeable. Then Marvin the Midget, he got himself on a vitamin kick. Little punk started growing again. -Oh, no. -Yeah. I went along with it for a while. But when he hit 5'8", I had to fire him. as the world's tallest midget? Tried that. "The World's Skinniest Fat Lady. " But it didn't work. The only real attraction I got Ieft is Gorgo the gorilla. I saw him as we came in. He's quite a fellow. Good voice. But even Gorgo doesn't bring in the customers Iike he used to. If you've seen one gorilla, you've seen them all. What are you gonna do, Oscar? Well, I'm gonna close down early tonight and go to Springfield, see if I can pick up a couple of new acts. The funniest thing happened to me in Springfield. Wish I could remember what it was. My word, the afternoon has flown, Oscar. I must be running along. It's been a Iot of fun, Gomez. Now, you promise you'II call us the minute you come back from Springfield. Morticia and I wanna have you for dinner soon. We'II prepare something special. Eye of newt. -Eye of newt? -Baked. Pugsley! Time to go home. Fine-Iooking beast, isn't he, Son? Yeah, we're buddies. I told you, we Addamses have always had a way with gorillas. Bye, Gorgo. MORTICIA: I'm so glad Pugsley enjoyed the gorilla. Fine type. -Could I hang Gorgo's picture in my room? -Well, of course you may, darling. He has such a fine sense of beauty. -Goodnight, Mother. -Goodnight, darling. Goodnight, Father. -Sweet dreams. -I hope they're about gorillas. That boy, cute as a bat's ear. Gorgo! It's you, it's really you! You'II wake the family. I just wired Oscar in Springfield, told him Gorgo is with us, there's nothing to worry about. You know, I've been watching him play with Pugsley. They've been racing to the top of that tree. -Pugsley's won every time. -A true Addams. Of course, the boy has an advantage. Gorgo can't hang by his teeth Iike our son can. That's true. I never thought of that. A snack for the plants. No, thank you, Lurch. They're getting much too fat. Lurch, have you seen our new houseguest? -He's the smartest ape I ever met. -He seems to have Iovely manners. Sets a fine example for Iittle Pugsley. Lurch, you will show him the usual Addams hospitality. Fine man, Lurch, but a bit of a snob. We've been having such fun. This is my mother, Gorgo. He is a playful one, isn't he? We want you to feel quite at home here. -Just happy to be here, I guess. -Pugsley, darling, try to make your friend understand that expressions of gratitude aren't necessary. And, by all means, forget you were in a cage and just act Iike one of the family. -I'II bet you youngsters are hungry. -I'II ring for Lurch. Lurch, Iunch. Perhaps a bunch of bananas. Bring two, I'm going to eat as much as he does. -Isn't he darling? -Yes, as I've always said, any boy who Ioves cobras, toads and apes can't be all bad. I'm so happy. Oh, no, I'm not. Angel. I did so want everything to be all right -when the Iadies come for tea. -Why shouldn't they be, sweet? Well, with Mama away, and all my tea Iinens need Iaundering If only I wasn't so busy with my plants. That is a problem. The problem is solved. Me? Laundry? -Dear Lurch, I knew you would pitch in. -It's the old Addams spirit, Lurch. Yes, sir. -Now Iet's see, what shall I serve? -Let's think. Darling, you're always there with the right suggestion. Excuse me. Lurch, to the harpsichord and play. -While I'm doing the Iaundry? -No, no, now. It helps me to think. Ole. That's very nice, but you're still missing the wrinkles. Sorry. Oh, well, it's all right. You've never worked as a Iaundress before. Have you? I'II try again. Now, you mustn't be impatient with Gorgo, Lurch. Very nice, but you're still missing the wrinkles. Oh, I think I'II do the dining room curtains, too, Lurch. I should've bought black curtains. BIack is so much more cheerful. -Isn't it amazing? -Congratulations, Gorgo. Well, Lurch, there are some things you can do and some things an ape can do. Darling, I'm afraid you hurt poor Lurch's feelings. AII I said to him was, "Lurch, there are some things you can do "and some things an ape can do. " What could be fairer than that? I know, dear, but Lurch is very sensitive. Besides, I think he's jealous of Gorgo. He probably thinks Gorgo is after his job. That's absurd. Lurch has been with us too Iong. I better explain it to him. You rang? Lurch, something been bothering you? Perhaps you resent our houseguest. Well, Lurch, you shouldn't, because we feel that you're his equal in every way. He has talent, true, but you have charm and personality. No question about it. Come on, Iet's see you turn a Iittle of it on. I'd Iike to see the woman who could resist that. Well, we just wanted you to know how we feel about you. We hope the feeling's mutual. -Good. -That will be all, Lurch. Darling, you handled that beautifully. Well, there's nothing Iike a good heart-to-heart talk. -She's almost finished, Pugsley. -Looks Iike a real space rocket. WOMAN: Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Is someone there? Addams residence. One moment please. -Mrs. Addams. -Oh, thank you, Lurch. Ready for the countdown, Pugsley. Went right through Uncle Fester's room. Too bad he's not home, he'd have gotten a bang out of it. That was Mrs. Magruder. She and Mrs. Page are on their way over. In that case, I'II take a run over to my dentist. He's got some wonderful new drills. But, darling, I did want you to be here when the Iadies arrive. No, I don't. I know the effect you have on the opposite sex. Sometimes it frightens me. I Iive in constant fear that some woman will steal you away from me. Banish the fear mi querida. You are the only cactus in the garden of my Iife. I'm sure glad gorillas don't act this way. I'm so delighted you Iadies could come. -Our pleasure, Mrs. Addams. -We'd heard so much about your home. You certainly have some unusual furnishings. I was afraid the white curtains would give it a dreary Iook. That's a very unusual clock there. Oh, thank you. It keeps perfect time. Well, I'm afraid it's 10 minutes slow. What strange plants! Well, they're really not at their best. I think they need some more hamburger. -Hamburger? -Their favorite food. Well, I never heard of it as plant food. I wonder if it would be good for my daisies. I wouldn't know. I've never raised daisies. Won't you Iadies be seated? If you'II excuse me a moment, I'II see if the tea is ready. That's excellent. I'II ring when I want you to serve. I serve. -Are you ready for tea? -Thank you. That bell! -Oh, we're having it fixed. -I should think so. Oh, thank you, dear. Gorgo's so handy around the house. And a fantastic Iaundress. Now, Iemon, cream or saccharin? Mrs. Magruder? Gorgo! -My sweet, you mustn't be so distressed. -But I did so want to join their club. And Gorgo spoiled everything. You know, I once read somewhere where some people are afraid of gorillas. Nonsense. Who could possibly be afraid of a gorilla? No, it was just that he served so abominably, spilling the tea out of the pot. I can imagine, spilling the tea. I hope you didn't punish him. Oh, no, I tried to cheer him up. I gave him some more clothes to iron. Thoughtful of you, Tish. I'II get it. Oscar! How good to see you. I just got in town and came right over to pick up Gorgo. -Come in, come in. -Thank you. Gorgo, your master is here. -He's ironing clothes? -He Iearnt it all by himself. Show him how well you do it, Gorgo. Gorgo, the killer gorilla, a Iaundress! I'm ruined, I'm ruined. Not while there's an Addams on the scene. There must be a solution. Eureka! And now, Iadies and gentlemen, I bring you the great attraction that you have all been waiting to see, the attraction that has brought thousands of people to my circus this week. Gorgo, the world's most domesticated gorilla. Darling, did I tell you I spoke to Mrs. Magruder? -She saw Gorgo at the carnival. -And all is forgiven? She apologized for being so hasty when she realized we were training him for a friend. Gorgo. Guess he was won over by his association with a typical American family. Darling, you're so right. However, the next time I serve tea to Mrs. Magruder, I'm going to do it in the usual way. Never spills a drop. 
Thank you, Thing. Congratulations. Darling, you remembered. How could I forget our 13th anniversary? It started on the stroke of midnight. Oh, I'm so excited, I can't get it open. Oh, thank you, Thing. Oh, darling, what a sensible gift. A bat net. Querida, it's a nightgown. Lace. For our 13th. Oh, darling, it's beautiful. And my favorite color, too. Black. You're ravishing. Congratulations! Congratulations! Happy anniversary! Thank you, darlings. Well, now, this is a surprise. You didn't think we'd forget your anniversary. Not the 13th. That's the lucky one. Have you and Father really been married 13 years? Oh, yes. And there were those who thought it would never happen. I still can't believe it. Mama and Morticia, let's not go into that tonight. Oh, that's my favorite story next to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Please tell us. Well, all right. Let's everybody get comfortable. Now, originally, your father wasn't supposed to marry me. He was supposed to marry my sister, Ophelia. Aunt Ophelia? - She was the catch of the season. - Aunt Ophelia? - Whoever said that? - Her mother. Granny Frump, my old school chum from Swamp Town High. I'll never forget that day. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. I knew we were in for trouble. Gomez, are you gonna spend your whole life sitting there when romance is on the way? How can I think of romance when my bronchial tubes are collapsing? You're the one that's collapsing. Been sitting at that contraption for 22 years. It's time you tried a girl. I don't like girls. Well, you can't marry a vaporizer. I'll get it, Lurch. Who could that be? It can be the big surprise I've arranged for you. Mrs. Frump and her daughter Ophelia. Pull yourself together, Gomez. You may be meeting the girl you're going to marry. Lurch, they're ganging up on me. What'll I do? - Run. - Run? But where? The Foreign Legion? It's too far. How about the American Legion? Esther Frump! Oh, it's good to see you again, Frumpy. You haven't changed a bit since Swamp Town High. And neither have you. And this is my beautiful daughter, Ophelia. That is my handsome son, Gomez. Give him your hand, Ophelia. Go, go! - Why so pale and wan, fair Gomez? - My head's stuffed. Oh, poor, poor laddie. I know just the thing for that. - You do? - Yes. - Well, how is it now? - It's gone to my back. Oh, how nice. - Boys are always falling for Ophelia. - She's a handy one. It was not for nothing she had all those judo and karate lessons. Every girl should know judo and karate. I lost one. - One what? - Daughter. My young one, Morticia. Oh, there she is. Come on, Kitty cat. Oh, you're so stubborn. - I'm Gomez Addams. - I'm Morticia Frump. That's my pet pet. - Kitty cat likes to eat. - I like cats. What's in there? - My plant. - Plant? In there? Oh, she bites. Her name is Cleopatra. And this is my doll. Her name's Marie Antoinette. I chopped off her head. That's my Morticia. I'm keeping her under wraps until my Ophelia's married. Had to bring her along 'cause I couldn't get anybody to sit with her cat. Well, it's not easy to find lion-sitters these days. After eating, Kitty likes to exercise. We've a nice garden. She can run around it. I'll show you. Gomez? She can find it herself. Gomez, why don't you and Ophelia take a walk in the garden? - Oh, it's too chilly out there. - Ophelia will warm you up. I'd better get my coat on. A coat? In July? Well, it is more becoming. I just wanna keep my bronchial tubes warm. Yeah, you wouldn't want a son-in-law with cold bronchial tubes, would you? Now, you and Ophelia run along and have fun. Fair Gomez, take my hand. Coming. - That boy of yours is all boy. - So is that girl of yours. Well, let's plan the wedding. What else do you like to do? On rainy nights, I like to snuggle into bed with a mustard plaster. "We are such stuff as dreams are made on. " - Do you like to dream, Gomez? - I have better nightmares when I'm awake. My dreams are of D'Artagnan, of Don Quixote who will tilt his lance against the foe. Like this! Come on, now, Cleopatra, have some nice zebra burger. All right, I'll up the dowry to 3,000, make it a six-layer cake, and supply the food, music and preacher. And I'll supply the guests. Fair? It seems fair. I hope Ophelia finds Gomez to her taste. She's very particular. - Back so soon, Gomez? - It's getting chilly out there. I have to get my cape. Would you like to join us in the garden? Could we dig some graves, for my dolls? I like to, but I'm afraid it would be too strenuous for me. Well, then I'd rather stay here. This one's name's Anne Boleyn. My favorite person in history is Ivan the Terrible. Oh, he was sweet. Fair Gomez, is there anything you'd like to do? Yes, go into a coma. Oh, he does have a delicious sense of humor. - And he shall be rewarded. - You're going to leave? Nonsense. I'm going to amuse thee, sire. - I told you, she's all talent. - And beauty. Isn't it wonderful, son? I I I've never heard anything like it. And would you believe it? She's a great cook, too. Here, hold my strings. I'll whip you up a lunch you'll never forget. I'm sure of it. Ophelia cooks all day just so she can do dishes. She loves to do dishes. - She does? - She loves water. She's forever jumping into fountains and little brooks. Even tubs and sinks. Her cooking's good, though. - Gomez, you didn't eat a thing. - I never eat lunch. It spoils my dinner. You didn't eat much, either. Oh, Ophelia's a marvelous cook but I don't like those kind of lunches. What kind do you like? Oh, crunchy things, like fried eye of newt, or barbequed turtle tips. - Or cold yak? - Oh, yes, yes. Morticia, stop talking about those crazy dishes of yours. Yes, Mama. They don't sound crazy to me. They sound yummy. Oh, Gomez. You better go now. Good idea. She's not outside, silly, she's in the kitchen. - I know. - Go on, you bashful boy. Your bashful girl is waiting. Come in, come in, the water's fine. Come along, come along. You can dry. It's like playing house. Thanks. Come, come. Dry, dry. - I think I chipped that one. - Slightly. Must be the hard water. Oh, no. It's just a funny-shaped dish. Did I do that? No, our Aunt Trivia sent us a whole dozen of these cup handles. It's beautiful. This one's unbreakable. Well, it used to be. Gomez. Let's play hide-and-seek. - But my bronchitis. - Nonsense! Here, you hide here. No, no, I'd find you there. That's the first place I'd look. I know. I'll hide and you seek. Tell me, do you think I'm sweet, kind and unselfish? You say the sweetest things. Thank you, Thing. Has anyone ever told you you have the softest brown eyes? No. Besides, my eyes are blue. No wonder no one has ever told you. - You found me! - It wasn't easy. Now, you've earned your reward. Drink to me only with thine lips. - How was that? - That was green. - Now, you hide and I'll seek you. - Good idea. No, no, no! Not that way. That way is the primrose path of dalliance. That way. - What color did you say your eyes were? - Blue. Keep them that way. By the way, how old are you, pigtails? - 22. - Really? I thought you were much older. Oh, there you are, Gomez. Congratulate me! Congratulate me! Gomez and I are going to be married. - Hallelujah! - Love at first sight! And I only twisted his arm once. Morticia? - You will be my bridesmaid. - Thank you, Ophelia. - Your bridal bouquet. - Thorns? Oh, no. I want daisies, buttercups and fresh weeds. I'll go down to the bogs and pick you some. - Congratulations, Gomez. - I tried to run away. - You'll have beautiful children. - I won't have them. She'll have them. - You'll both have them. - That's what I'm afraid of. I don't want to marry Ophelia. Oh, my, that is a problem. Oh, what lovely trains. I just adore trains. You do? Well, let's give them a whirl. These trains always take my mind off troubles. What's that? That's my friend, Thing. - What a charming helper. - He's been my companion since childhood. You You don't think he's peculiar, do you? Of course not. We must accept our friends for what they are. Here, you run the trains. Isn't it exciting? One train going east, the other one going west. I have an idea. What if they crash, head-on? Better still, I'll blow them up! Now, you take that switch. When they meet at the bridge, wham! - You spoke French. - Yes. Say it again. - Something strange is coming over me. - What? For the first time in my life, my sinuses are clear! How's your bronchitis? It's gone! My bronchitis is gone. I don't know what I'm doing, but I can't help it. I could help it but I don't want to. Speak some more French. Anything. Oh, Gomez, please. We must think of your betrothed. My darling sister. Oh, yes. What'll we do? - I have it. - What? I'll call my Uncle Fester. Why, thank you, Thing. Sweet old Uncle Fester. He used to write an advice-to-the-Iovelorn column. He'd still be doing it, too, if everybody hadn't started suing him. Darn it. A person just can't relax around here. - Hello? - Hello? You'll have to talk louder. Hello, Uncle Fester? It's me, Morticia. Morticia who? Morticia Frump. Morticia Frump? I'm your niece. That Morticia Frump. Uncle Fester, I'm madly in love with Gomez Addams but he's engaged to marry my sister, Ophelia. What should I do? Forget him. Anybody that'd marry your sister, Ophelia, must be a nut! - What did he say? - He wasn't home. I'll speak to my Cousin Itt. He's had lots of personal experience in affairs of the heart. - A real ladies' man. - Oh, he sounds perfect. - Where is he? - In his favorite nook, up the chimney. Up the chimney? Well, sometimes he prefers the broom closet. As a matter of fact, he sort of looks like a broom. Well, not really a broom. A mop! - Sounds fascinating. - Yes. Don't go away. Say something else in French. Cousin Itt! I know you hate to be disturbed. But I've got to talk to you. Cousin Itt, my whole future is at stake and all you can think of is your own selfish pleasure. Is that your final answer? Well, at least you're keeping an open mind. Cousin Itt, you've got to help me! If you come down, I'll let you play with my octopus. You can use my vaporizer! I'll let you blow up one of my trains. Cousin Itt, I knew I could count on you. I always said blood is thicker than water, and everyone says you're thicker than both. Itt, I'm in love. No, she hasn't got a friend for you. Please, you've got to listen to my problem. Thank you. You're such a suave, sophisticated man of the world and I thought you could give me some advice. You see, I'm engaged to one girl and I love another. What should I do? Isn't that against the law? Oh, come on, Itt. An old roué like you ought to be able to figure something out. Think. Boy, you really are thinking. Really? Well, you sure make it sound like a sensible way out. I'll tell Morticia. She's the one I'm in love with. Thanks a lot, Itt. Underneath all that hair, you really are What are you underneath all that hair? Roots? Makes sense. You better get up the chimney before Mama grabs your place. Enjoy yourself! And thanks a lot, Itt. Hello, birdie. My, you sing pretty, too. Morticia. Cousin Itt has the perfect solution to all my problems. - What did he say? - He said I should shoot myself. It does sound rather simple. I'll join you. Be my guest. Well, au revoir. That's French. Not here, darling. In the hereafter. In the hereafter. - And did you die? - No. We had the guns at the ready and just as I was about to say "three," Thing reached out and snatched them away. Thing never could stand noise. But what happened with Aunt Ophelia? We'll tell you the rest some other evening. That's right, children. It's time for bed. - Come on. - Go on. I almost forgot my shortcut. Dear Uncle Fester. Every time he hears the story of our romance, it gives him such a lift. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -The mail's in. -Never mind, Lurch, I'II get it. My new carving knife. Nice knife. Can I play autopsy with it? Well, darling, autopsy's a fine game. But this is for carving works of art. Well, either I've got tough hair or this knife needs sharpening. There, darling, I think it's sharp enough now. Lovely, Morticia. querida mia. -Hurry up, Gomez. -Are you getting tired, Uncle Fester? No, I Iike to pose. It's so artistic. -Good. I want to get the inner you. -Not with that. -Well, that's just for carving. -That's what I'm afraid of. Not for carving you, for carving your Iikeness. Now, Iet's see a Iittle more of the Addams character. Now we're getting somewhere. Yes. Now, a Iittle more to the right. More. Keep going. Excellent. Are you sure you're getting enough of my personality? Try it in reverse. Back up a Iittle. Keep going. Perfect. Yes, but are you sure you're getting the real me? You're right. Let's have the real, the true, the unadorned you. Beautiful. And now for immortality. Don't move, don't Iook, don't even breathe. -Don't worry, I'II -Don't! That's it. Hold it. By Jove, I think I've done it. Why, Gomez, you're the Michelangelo of Halloween pumpkins. How do you Iike it so far? Darling, you have the soul of an artist and the touch of a surgeon. Halloween always inspires me. Are you Iooking forward to the guests who might come in tonight for trick-or-treat? Oh, yes. And the children are so excited about going out. Good. -I'd better see to the punch and cookies. -AIways the perfect hostess. GOMEZ: Give us the smile. -Lurch, I see you have the bowl ready. -Yes, Mrs. Addams. I think I'II start the punch and Iet it mellow for a while. -You may fix the sandwiches, Lurch. -Very good, Mrs. Addams. Divine. Thank you, Thing. Gomez! -Morticia! -Yes? Wednesday and Pugsley are all dressed up for trick-or-treat. Well, bring them down, bring them down. -Hear the siren? -That's a police siren. Great, the tank's dry as a bone. Listen, next time we pull a stickup will you get gas? AII right, all right, I forgot. Yeah, and you dropped your gun in the getaway. Boy, this sure ain't your night. Come on, Iet's get out of here before the cops spot us. And I'II take the Ioot. I don't want you to forget it. I know, you're always mad, Marty. Hey, the whole area's heating up. We've gotta take cover someplace. -In there, quiet, behind that tree. -Okay. Hey, hey. I could've sworn that gate was closed. Man, you're beginning to give me the creeps. Come on. What's the idea? Why'd you slam it so hard? I was gonna ask you the same thing. -How do we Iook? -Mama, these are far too I agree, Gomez, they're much too startling. They'II scare the wits out of people. Yes. When you knock on neighbors' doors, you'd better say, "Do not be alarmed. We are only Iittle children. " PUGSLEY: Can we go now? As soon as your father finishes the jack-o'-Iantern. How do you Iike it? Think it Iooks Iike Uncle Fester? Better! Good eye. A true Addams. This joint gives me the willies. Will you get off it? It's probably the house of some sweet Iittle old Iady. Now, children, are we ready for trick-or-treat? -We're ready, Father. -Yeah, Iet's go. Fine. Now, these are to hold all the goodies you'II get. I've got mine. AII right, Mama, we'II escort our Iittle goblins on their Halloween rounds. -There's somebody coming, Marty. -Yeah, I hear. -Will you put the mask away? -I don't want them to recognize us. Look, Father, we have visitors. -WEDNESDAY: That man has a mask. -They must be trick-or-treating. -Yes, yes, of course. -Don't come any closer. Mama, you must be right. Better make your speech, children. -Do not be alarmed. -Do not be alarmed. -We are only Iittle children. -We are only Iittle children. We're on our way to play trick-or-treat, too. Yeah, we're out for Halloween, too. A perfect night for Halloween. You must come in and celebrate with us. Sorry, we got other plans. On second thought, we'II take you up on that offer. Splendid. Mama, I'II Ieave the children in your capable hands. Don't keep them out too Iate. -Just Iong enough to fill up our bags. -Goodbye, Father. Morticia, our first guests have arrived. This is my wife. Morticia, this is How ridiculous! I forgot to ask your names. Look, Mac, if you're thinking you're going to be I'm Marty and he's CIaude. Welcome to our home. Hey, that's quite an outfit you got on, Iady. Thank you. I always wear this one for Halloween. Looks real good for Halloween. We always try to get our home in the Halloween mood, too. Yeah, you sure do. I heard voices, Gomez. Who is it? Do we have guests? Indeed we have, Uncle Fester. This is Marty and CIaude. PIeased to meet you. You You folks sure don't hold back on Halloween. It's our favorite holiday. And this is our butler, Lurch. -Pal, you top 'em all. -Yes, Lurch is tops. Most efficient, too. I forgot to Iight the pumpkin. It Iooks just Iike me. Excuse me. Gentlemen, come over here and I'II give you a treat. -Open your bag. -Don't start getting cute, mister. Now, now, there's nothing to be ashamed of. I think it's rather heartwarming that adults get in the Halloween spirit. -Yeah, but just the same, I ain't -I told you he was efficient. -Excuse me, Lurch. -Why, you dirty Take it easy, Marty. Let's see what happens. It's full of money. Okay, pal, you had your Iook. Now just hand it over. Morticia, our neighbors have given these gentlemen hundreds of dollars in trick-or-treat. Makes one proud to Iive in such a neighborhood. And I was going to give you apples. My apologies, gentlemen. There, that's better. Happy Halloween. -Would you excuse us a minute? -Of course. Go right ahead, gentlemen. -Did you see what I saw? -Yeah, a drawer full of Ioot. Yeah, and the mask the big guy's got on. We ought to wear something Iike that the next time we pull a job. I'm gonna find out where he got it. Friend, we've been admiring the mask. Mind telling us where it come from? It is mine. Yeah, I know, but where did He's for real. They're all for real. Must you go? We better, we better. Just when things were beginning to perk up. -Can't you stay a bit Ionger? -Not this season, Iady. Well, since you treated us so nice, I guess we'II stick around for a while. Capital! We'II celebrate in the old tradition. -I'II see to the punch. -I shall help you, my dear. Fester, get the Halloween poems from the Iibrary. Lurch, you get the tub ready for the bobbing game. You gentlemen make yourselves at home. The cops sounded Iike they were right outside. Yeah, guess we better stay put for a while. And as Iong as we gotta stay, we may as well make the most of it. Okay. I'm kind of hungry. Not the food, stupid. You saw that drawer full of money. They probably got a Iot of jewelry, too. We'II clean them out, and then we'II scram when the coast is clear. I'm with you, pal. I do think our guests are charming, don't you? Yes, especially the one with the scar. He reminds me of Rupert Styx. He has the same beautiful, beady eyes. I thought we'd agreed, Morticia, never to mention the name of Rupert Styx again. -Gomez, darling, you're not still jealous? -You were engaged to him. Oh, well, I was just a silly young girl then. I was fascinated by his Iong fingernails and the way his Iip curled when he smiled. He was a handsome devil. Morticia, please never mention his name again. I promise, bubele. querida mia. When we're together, darling, every night is Halloween. The punch is ready. -It's Iocked. We gotta get a key. -We may have to rough 'em up a Iittle. Yeah, well, that's my department. You just watch. It's a good thing one of us is all there tonight. Hey. Here they come. We take 'em. Okay, folks, this is a stickup. MORTICIA: I'm so sorry the children aren't here. They'd be so amused. Let's not rush the food. The punch is ready but first Gomez will read us a Halloween poem. -Here's the poem, Gomez. -Thank you, Uncle Fester. It's our favorite. No Halloween would seem quite complete without it. Won't you gentlemen please be seated? -Poem? We'd be better off in jail. -Shut up! I'II fix the Iights. It'II put us in the proper mood. FESTER: Lurch! To the harpsichord. "It was Halloween evening and through the abode "Not a creature was stirring, not even a toad "Jack-o'-Ianterns are hung on the gallows with care MORTICIA: "To guide sister witch as she flies through the air" Drawn by eight beautiful bats. "And she calls out to them "Come FIitter, come FIutter Come FIapper and FIyer "Come Chitter, come Chatter, Come Vicious Vampire" Excuse me. Is something wrong? Good heavens! What in the world brought that on? It's obvious. They just don't Iike poetry. Gentlemen, I'm so glad you decided to stay. You are staying, aren't you? -If you say so. -We Iike you folks. Wonderful. Now we'II have some real fun. Yes, we're going to play an old-fashioned Halloween game. -Game? -Yes, a bobbing game. PIease, if you don't mind, we'II just sit here quiet for a while -and then scram. -No, you must play. -Okay, okay, if you say so. -Sure. We used to play the game. Marty, you remember. Yeah, that's where everybody kneels around a tub and bobs for the apples. -Apples? Apples? -Well, what do you bob for? Look, Marty. We call it "Bobbing for the crab. " A real challenge. -Yeah, but that crab's alive. -And full of snap, too. That's the challenge. -GOMEZ: Great sport. -I'II go first. Uncle Fester, no. -That honor belongs to our guests. -Oh, no, no. You go ahead, pal. -No, I was rude. -We Iike rudeness. PIease, we insist. -After you, CIaude. -No, be my guest. I'II get it. It's probably some more trick-or-treaters. Darling, ask them in. I just Iove Halloween. Well, now, those are interesting costumes. These are not costumes. We're police officers. GOMEZ: Well, come in. Just checking the neighborhood. Everything all right here? Yes, fine. We're just getting into the Halloween spirit. Care to join us? -No, thanks, we're on a manhunt. -Nice night for it. -You won, you won. -Both won. Ole, ole. PIease get it off. Get it off! Isn't that absolutely amazing? Would you Iike to try it again? -Try it again? I'd rather wrestle a Iion. -Would you? Wonderful. MORTICIA: Kitty? Here Kitty, Kitty. -No! -No! Poor Kitty. Just terrified of people. Well, it's my turn now. Cops or no cops, we'd better blow before we get killed. But it bugs me to Ieave all that Ioot in the drawer. They wanna play games, we'II play 'em a game. A game that'II get us the Ioot. -Look, money isn't everything. -It's enough. Hey, folks. CIaude and I got a game we wanna play. It's called hide-and-seek. Hide-and-seek? Sounds rather mild compared to bobbing for crabs. -It'II fool you. -Goody. Let's try it. I'm not having much Iuck down here. Well, Claude and I'll be "it," see, and everybody else scrams and hides. -Then what happens? -We find you. -Yes? -Then we hide. And you find us. -Yes? -That's it. Excuse us for a moment. My dear, I think we made a terrible mistake inviting those two men in. -You do? -Hide-and-seek? Well, I'II admit it is a bit eccentric. And they are rather strange. But, after all, they're guests in our home. You're right. Addams hospitality. -You're ready? -Ready. Okay, now everybody hides and we'II count to ten. MARTY: Pal, we're ready. Goody. I Iove games. You, too. Okay, here we go. One, two, three, four, five, six Knock it off. Get the drawer open. -Hurry up! -Okay, okay. Oh, boy. I can't wait to get out that door. -Okay. Come on. -Okay. This Ioot will pay us back for all the trouble we went through. -It's Iocked! -Now what? Break the window. -Did you -Let's get out of here! -They're not seeking very hard. -Strange game. -They must want us to win. -Very sporting. Now, two of them went in there and the big guy's back there. This way. Let's go. What's the matter with them? Well, they ask us to hide and then they just run off. Couple of oddballs. They'II be all right. Look. Those nice policemen are helping them into their squad car. Probably going to give them a Iift home. Darling, did you pay your dues to the Zen-Yogi society? My dear, I'm a paid-up member. This is their Iatest position. -Are you comfortable? -Don't I Iook it? Of course. Is there anything new in the paper tonight? Nothing much. A revolution in South America, a war in Asia, a flood Oh, here's something. It says our friends, Marty and CIaude, were sent up the river. Good. They needed a vacation. 
Missed. That's breathtaking. - My painting? - The thunder. Your painting is absolutely indescribable. It is inspiring, working between the flashes of lightning. - It does something for one's eyes. - It gives your work character. Evocative of the great artists of the past. Really darling? Like whom? Well, Toulouse-Lautrec. - No, this is a much smaller canvas. - Whistler's Mother? Darling, she never painted. That's right, she was too busy whistling. Pugsley, Wednesday, why aren't you in bed? I thought we put you to bed hours ago. We couldn't sleep. It's so nice and gloomy. This is the best storm since lightning put the short circuit in Uncle Fester. Remember all those red, white and blue flashes coming from his head? - It was a beautiful sight, wasn't it? - It was indeed lovely. But this is no time for sentimental reminiscences. Come along children, I'm going to read you a nice bedtime story. But we don't want a bedtime story. But darling, I was going to read one of your favorites, dear Mr. Poe's Murder in the Rue Morgue. Poe does have a way with whimsy. We'd rather hear the rest of the story about how you and Father got married. Now, let's not go into that old chestnut. Gomez, darling, what a terrible way to talk about our beautiful romance! Darling, I'm not talking about our beautiful romance, it's what led up to it. Nonsense. It's a true-to-life adventure and the children should know all about it. - All right. - Now come along. Let's sit right down here, and get comfortable. Now, where were we? You just talked French, and Father just kissed you. No, they were going to shoot each other because Father had promised to marry Aunt Ophelia. Now then, plans for the wedding were in full swing. Your Aunt Ophelia was still trying to amuse your father. I was just sitting there, cutting out paper dolls. Faster, Lurch, faster. - I told you, she's all talent. - And beauty. Isn't it wonderful, son? Well, that's all settled. We can have the wedding right here in the living room. Well, it's not exactly the main ballroom of the Ritz but I guess it'll do. My Gomez and your Ophelia do make a lovely couple, don't they? Would you mind singing some other song, please? - Kiss Me Again? - I can't, - my lips are chapped from all that vapor. - Oh, poor, poor laddie. A sudden change in altitude is good for the sniffles. I do hope your vaporizer won't interfere with our honeymoon? By george, it will. Shall we call it off? No. Mater? - Fair, shy Gomez doth seem reluctant. - Reluctant? He's always at your feet. Methinks he's trying to weasel out of it. Poor dear. He must really be sick. - Well, the dowry isn't settled yet. - Well, settle it, settle it. Details bore me. What are you two whispering about? Ophelia refuses to go through with the ceremony, unless Gomez puts his Brazil nut plantation in her name. Well, we already gave you half his elephant herd. Including the tusk rights. I think it's a very generous offer. - That's clever. - It's yours. How do you do that? I don't know, it just always comes out that way. Morticia, this is your sister Ophelia's wedding, not yours. Yes, Mama. Now how about coming up with a decent dowry? - Not a nickel over 5,000. - Oh, come, come now, you can do better than that. That's an insult. Insult me some more. If we push the ceremony up to 2:00. What do you say, son? He accepts. Oh, fair Gomez, from now on your vapor is my vapor. Come child. You need a wedding dress. I know a seamstress that is fast, cheap and fairly accurate. You'll have to excuse me, I have a wedding cake to bake. We're alone. Together. - Morticia. - Gomez. - Morticia. - Gomez. - May I call you Tish? - Of course. I've waited for this moment, Tish. So have I. Congratulations. - They shouldn't leave us alone like this. - It's torture, madness, and very bad judgment on their part. How can I marry Ophelia when I love you? - What does Emily Post say? - Not a word. - It's not that your sister isn't a nice girl - Sweet. - Muscular. - An angel. A doll. It's just that I can't stand her. - Why don't you tell her so? - Because I'm a weak, sniveling coward. Besides, I gave her my word. But what does the word of a weak, sniveling coward mean? Means I'm going to be married at 2:00. Uncle Fester. Oh, how wonderful to see you again. Morticia, I wouldn't have missed your wedding for anything. Well, it's not me who's getting married, Uncle Fester. It's Ophelia. Ophelia? What kind of a nut did she finally snag? That one. Gomez, I'd like for you to meet my Uncle Fester. - So you're the lucky bridegroom, eh? - Bridegroom, yes. Lucky, no. Uncle Fester, Gomez and I are madly in love. Then why don't you two get hitched? Ophelia's my sister. I couldn't betray her. Besides, it would break her heart. It's bad for the digestion. All we have to do is find her another man. Who's the little guy talking to the servant? That's my Cousin Itt. He's the family intellectual. The longhair of the family. He looks it. Is he married? Free as a tumbleweed. He looks that, too. He'd be a perfect groom for Ophelia. He'd never see what he's getting into. Oh, fair Gomez, I'm back. You two run along and leave the matchmaking to me. Uncle Fester shot the arrow that brought my mother and father together. The arrow and the gun. Leave it to me. Uncle Fester, how sweet of you to come to my wedding. Biggest mistake since Uncle Tic married Aunt Phobia. But they were a perfect match. He had two left feet, and she had two right ones. It was a mere physical attraction. I love Gomez's soul. For 50,000 fish, you're entitled to a lot more than that. Now, there's more your type. That's Gomez's Cousin Itt. I'll introduce you. Cousin Itt, this is Ophelia. Charmed. I love a mystery. Yes, she is direct. Now, if you two kids are smart, you'll get married before 2:00. Exactly 11:31. - Flatterer. - He means it, too. It isn't every girl he calls a geekle-gackle-gookle. Would you like to pick some daisies? They have very deep roots. Why don't you go out in the garden? They have some lovely deadly nightshade and some wonderful poison sumac. Nay! I do not like poison sumac. It will not grow on my head. Yes, perhaps I should have my head examined. - They do have some lovely weeds. - Weeds? Why didn't you say so? Silly, silly. - Sorry, sorry. - Let's go, Cousin Itt. Weeds are my favorite flowers. The seed has been planted. The plot cannot fail. Oops! I forgot to tell them about the quicksand. A few minutes under the hair dryer and you'll be as good as new. And you, couldn't you see where you were going? - Of course. I fell in, didn't I? - Fine time to go wading in quicksand. You're supposed to be getting married. I'd be willing to postpone it for a few years. Oh, no, I'll jump right into my wedding dress. I like feeling damp. That was my favorite song, until just now. Isn't that sweet? The bridegroom's getting nervous. Come on, we'd better help the bride dress. I haven't been this excited since Aunt Trivia's funeral. Uncle Fester, what happened? I tried, but I guess Cousin Itt just wasn't her type. No accounting for certain tastes. She doesn't even like poison sumac. - What do I do now? - Lf it'll make you feel any better, you can cry during the ceremony. Well, that will make me feel a little better. - Oops! I forgot to turn off the dryer. - Great Scott! What do I do? A little stretch on the rack and he'll be as good as new. Couple more minutes under there, he'd have disappeared completely. Really? Maybe I should try that dryer. Well, he's not up in the tower room. He's not in the basement. I looked there. Cousin Itt, you shouldn't have looked in the chimney. One spark, and you'd have gone up in flames. Well, let's face it. Your Gomez is gone, and my Ophelia is upstairs in tears. Well, don't panic, he's around here somewhere. You rang? Lurch, have you seen my son Gomez? No, Mrs. Addams. Where can that boy be? The river? Imagine, a jilted Frump. We'll find him. Now all of you spread out, and keep your eyes open. You do the best you can. To marry, or not to marry? That is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous Hello, there. How did you find me? I heard you calling. That wasn't me, that was Cousin Fungus. I'd better turn off the echo. Thing? - Is Cousin Fungus coming to the wedding? - Oh, no, he doesn't get out much. He's lived in a cave in back of the tunnel for 30 years. What exquisite taste. Do you like it? It's a divine tunnel. - Then stay here with me. - Just the two of us? No, the four of us. Cousin Fungus and Thing. We can play four-handed solitaire. You do paint a lovely picture. But we can't. You must think of Ophelia. I did. That's why I'm here in the tunnel. Think of all the many romances that started out a bit wobbly and then worked out. Think of Romeo and Juliet. They died. But what fun they had those last three days. I suppose there's nothing we can do. Courage, mon ami. - You spoke French. - Gomez, now control yourself. We don't want to give Cousin Fungus the wrong idea. - Yes, yes. - Now come along. Poor Ophelia's crying her eyes out. That might be an improvement. Come on out, Gomez. You coward. Come on, Gomez, come out and get married. Uncle Fester, I thought you were our friend. I am, but we can't have a jilted Frump. It'd be a stain on our family escutcheon. And our family escutcheon is messy enough. Why don't you just tell Ophelia the truth? - Gomez is a weak, sniveling coward. - That's right. Wouldn't you rather be a strong, masterful he-man? - Too dangerous. - It doesn't have to be. Not if you go about it right. Why don't we try it? Uncle Fester, you be Ophelia. You're kind, sensitive, quiet and understanding. She certainly has changed. And you are the new Gomez. You're decisive, direct and definite. - I'm afraid. - That's pretty definite. - Thank you. - Uncle Fester, you're Ophelia, you're here, playing with your lyre. - Gee! I didn't know I could play this thing. - Uncle Fester. Now, Gomez, put these things down. There. Now, don't be frightened. Go in there and talk to her. - Ophelia, I don't want to marry you. - Gee, thanks. No, no, no! - Thank you very much? - No, Uncle Fester, you have to put up more resistance. - Gotcha. - Now. Come on. Go again. - Ophelia, I won't marry you. - What! - Uncle Fester! - I'll shoot you this time! - I was just fooling. - Let go of me, I'll shoot him in the back! - Uncle Fester, no, no. - Just fooling. Dear, this isn't working out at all. I know, I'll play Ophelia. Shucks! That isn't fair. - Well, you can play my mother. - All right. Ophelia, your voice needs tuning. It's that just that I'm so excited about my nuptials. Here comes my betrothed now. Here comes my betrothed now. - Ophelia, I - All right, son, speak up, speak up. Mrs. Frump, I'm afraid I can't marry your daughter. - What! I'll shoot him in the - Uncle Fester Mother, please. Let the dear boy speak his mind. You were saying? I was saying, there is only one person in the whole world I could ever marry, - and that one person is - Who? - You. - Gomez. - Morticia. - Gomez. - Morticia. - Gomez. Morticia. It's beautiful. Hey, we better hurry, that minister charges by the hour. Come on. Coming, coming. Aren't you glad you decided to go through with it? Delighted. - My, doesn't she look lovely? - A real Frump. Great Scott! Who is that? Well, that's just Morticia, with her hair all combed out. - Sloppy kid. - A lovely child - has become a breathtaking woman. - Ophelia? - Morticia. - Who? Ophelia. There is a customary question I have to ask. Does anyone object to this ceremony taking place? Yes. - Who? - Me. I know this will come as a shock to you, Ophelia, but I must tell you the truth. I'm unworthy of you. - Really? - I'm sheltered, I'm spoiled, cowardly. - That's true. - Not only that, I'm I'm irascible and unpleasant and stupid. That's true, too. - I have some endearing qualities. - Like what? Well - I'm rich. - That's a very nice quality. - Thank you. - But you're still unworthy. Besides, I think I've already found my true love. My D'Artagnan, my Don Quixote, my knight in shining armor. Sounds like me. But I'm her uncle. I couldn't bring myself to hurt you, Gomez, shatter your dreams. But since you've confessed your unworthiness, you leave me no alternative. Come, my love. I might remind you that, as the saying goes, I get paid whether the ball game's rained out or not. Fear not, a wedding will be held here this day. He's looking this way. Do you think he means me? The woman for me is that graceful, elegant creature standing over there. He does mean me! - Will you marry me? - I thought you'd never ask. Oh, your hair That dress, it drives me wild. I'll never wear another. - Do you really want to marry this man? - I certainly do. - But you've only known him a few days. - What better way to get acquainted? Right. Friends, we're going to try it again. We're going to proceed with the marriage of Gomez Addams and - What's your name, child? - Morticia Frump. My favorite Frump. That's how your father and I got married. - Did you like the story? - Yes, it was so romantic. - Pugsley? - All romances are a little goofy. Did Aunt Ophelia marry Cousin Itt? No, I'm afraid it was just a summertime romance. Cousin Itt turned out to be too much of a playboy. I'd like to hear more about that. It's much too stimulating this time of night. Now you run upstairs and pop into bed, while you can still enjoy this lovely thunderstorm. - Run along. - Go on. Perhaps we should go upstairs and enjoy the thunderstorm. Oh, darling, I can't. I have to finish my painting. Querida, must you paint tonight? I want to capture this wonderful lightning. Gomez, darling, look. I've captured it. Oh, yes. 
Oh, I love coming down to this old room. Such charming mustiness. In many ways the most attractive room in the house. A regular treasure-trove of memories. I'm sure we'll find 100 things down here to give to the charity bazaar. Oh, Gomez, darling, look. - Your wedding dress? - Yes. You're not giving this dress to the bazaar? Of course not, darling. It has a special sentimental value for me that no one else could ever appreciate. Perhaps I'll give this lovely mirror. Remember the day I cracked it? Yes. We had those seven wonderful years of good luck. We couldn't part with that, of course. Seems like everything down here is a priceless family heirloom. Morticia, let's forget the bazaar. They haven't even asked us to donate this year, anyway. Yes, and I can't understand that. Our old insurance man, Mr. Henson, is in charge this year, and he's been to our home. He knows what lovely things we have. Behaved very strangely the last time he was here. Perhaps he's one of those people with no taste. Last year, they auctioned off my stuffed vulture for 35 cents. Your live one would've gotten much more. I suppose we should just give junk, things we want to get rid of. Excellent idea. But, darling, that isn't the real spirit of giving. We should give things of value, things we really cherish. All right. I'll give them my grandfather moose clock. The least I can give is this beautiful old table. But, Morticia, that's priceless. The original flogging table used by Ivan the Terrible. I know, dear, it hurts. But that means it's right. Just picture the addition it will make to someone's home. As always, cara mia, you are right. Darling, I'm going to call the bazaar headquarters and tell Mr. Henson that we're going to contribute after all. I know he'll be thrilled. No, no, no. No more Addamses. We already have too much. Mr. Henson, we can never have enough charity. Yes, we can. Of course. We welcome your donations, Mrs. Addams. I'm dreadfully sorry we overlooked you. I don't know how that happened. Well, I do. I deliberately passed them up. Mr. Henson will be over with our truck. Yes. Goodbye, my dear. In charitable work, we can't allow personal feelings to interfere. All right. All right, all right, I'll go. But I'm taking our biggest, strongest truck driver with me. That's fine. And please, examine all this monstrous junk they contribute very carefully. And if you come across a shrunken head, look closely. It may be mine. Isn't it exciting, darling? The whole family is getting into the spirit of giving. Excellent character building, especially for the children. The most important thing is that we're all giving the things we cherish the most. Look. Look what Mama just donated. That's giving with real pain. Her old friend Dr. Livingstone. You're setting a shining example for us all, dear. I'm donating Mary Queen of Scots. Darling, that is your most precious possession. I can chop a head off another doll. I know, but not all the heads come off as nicely as this one. Are you sure you want to donate Mary? Yes, but I'll never be able to look her head in the eye again. Uncle Fester, I haven't picked up your donation yet. Charity begins at home, you know. Would you mind turning this just a little bit? I'm trying to get rid of a headache. That's so soothing. Uncle Fester, I'm ashamed of you. Even little Pugsley has given generously. Not his favorite wolf's head clock! No, but he has given his toads and his lizards and his Gila monster. And you know how he loves them. I think the least you could do is give that old suit of armor. No, not my suit of armor, please. I need it to feel secure. Like Pugsley needs his wolf head clock. That armor is the only place I can find to hide in to take my afternoon's nap. Uncle Fester, the whole family has given until it hurts. Well, I like to hurt as much as anybody, but don't ask me to give my armor up. I have to wear it practically every day to scare off those neighborhood kids. They annoy you? Not me, but they keep waving sticks and throwing stones at my new pet falcon, and he's getting a nervous stomach. Uncle Fester, that bird is simply going to have to learn the difference between a gopher and a cocker spaniel. Morticia, please, not this armor. They're not making suits like that anymore. Look at the cut of that pasguard. And the hang of the jambeau. It even came with two pair of cuisses. You can keep the extra pair of cuisse and wear it with a matching coat of mail. Make a nice sports outfit. Let's get it all nicely polished up. Mr. Henson will be here shortly. Morticia may send this to the bazaar, but I'm going to make sure it comes back. Pretty clever, huh? I'm glad you agree with me. Here you are, Cleopatra, some nice, fresh walrus burger. Darling, come along. Eat. Cleopatra? Oh, Lurch. I've decided to give the baby strangler to the bazaar. Taking it away from its m-a-m-a? Yes, the baby's been weaned for several months now. Would you put the baby in the sack, while I cover the mother? She'd carry on terribly if she knew. You can polish Pugsley's shoes later. Now, Cleopatra Quick. Put it in the sack and take it in the living room with the other things. Oh, darling, don't carry on so. Oh, yes. Oh, you know, don't you? You have a mother's intuition. But we must all give till it hurts. You're sick. What've you been eating? Or whom? Pugsley! Pugsley. What did you do with Pugsley? You murderer. You get three good meals a day. Out with him. Out with him! There's no need for you to eat between meals. Cough him up. I've heard of biting the hand that feeds you, but this is too much. Pugsley! Pugsley! - You want me, Father? - I hear you, Pugsley. Keep talking, boy. I'll find you. Pugsley. Pugsley! Thank heaven you were indigestible. Thank you, Thing. Stuck. Unstuck. We've come to pick up the donations for the charity bazaar. Follow me. It's all right. He's really a nice fellow. Yeah? He looks like parts of three nice fellows. Oh, Mr. Henson, how nice to see you again. How do you do, Mrs. Addams? This is Jason, our truck driver. Charmed. I do have a lovely collection for you. - Surprised? - Not a bit. Mr. Jason, you may start loading these things. Lurch will help you. Would you gentlemen excuse me? Henson, good to see you. Well, we certainly outdid ourselves this year. - So I see. - Have you seen the clock - I'm giving you folks? - Does it explode? Certainly not. I wouldn't tamper with a valuable old timepiece like that. Come here. - How about that? - How about that? Well, it looks like The rear end of a moose? You have a very discerning eye, Henson. Ever seen any moose ends like that? Definitely not. At least it's just not a plain old head staring down at you. No, those are so common. Is it trying to get through the wall, or back out? It's a clock, Henson. The tail switches on the half hour, and goes all the way around on the hour. Henson. A rare and valuable clock. You really mustn't part with it, Mr. Addams. It's We mustn't deprive you of it. It's much too lovely. Exactly what I was thinking. Besides, it would be a shame to deprive Pierre of the choice view that he's had for over 50 years. After all, how many other mooses are lucky enough to see themselves as others see them? Besides, an ordinary man wouldn't appreciate a collector's item like that. Little Pugsley has an amusing conventional clock up in his room. I'm sure he'd be glad to donate it to charity. I'll run right up and get it. - You all right, Mr. Henson? - You tell me. Henson, here we are. Just a simple child's timepiece. It's a variation on the cuckoo clock. Watch. - Wonderful, isn't it? - What do you feed it? Feed a clock? You're pulling my leg, Henson. I'll be interested to see what it brings at auction. Yes. Who knows? Someone may just be furnishing a nursery. A nursery. Perfect. Why all that gay, toe-tapping music? What's the celebration? I thought a little light music might bring Pugsley out of his depression. Great Scott, he's not still up the chimney? He's been up there for hours. He says he's never coming down. Well, I imagine it is nice up there, at that. You know he's sulking because you gave his wolf's head clock to the bazaar. I know. I should have asked his permission first, but I was so sure he'd want to donate it. He says it's the only thing he's really ever loved. The lad should learn that if you give till it hurts, it's fun. I know, dear, but you try. I'm exhausted. Pugsley, what do you say we visit the zoo? You can see a live wolf's head there. Really pretty. Darling, this may be a traumatic experience for him. Perhaps we'd better try and get the clock back. Nonsense. Some of the finest men in the Addams family have been shaped by childhood traumas. Still, it tears at my heart to think I've alienated my son. Well, darling, perhaps we can get Uncle Fester to make him a new wolf's head clock with bigger and better fangs. By the way, where is Fester? I haven't seen him since yesterday. Oh, dear, I do hope he hasn't gone into one of his trances. The last one went on for five days. I thought he was a goner. Dear Uncle Fester, he does love to play dead. Matter of fact, I haven't seen Thing since yesterday, either. Don't worry, Thing can handle himself. Well, I'm gonna have one last try with Pugsley. I tell you what, Pugsley boy That does it. I've just got to repair this tragic rift somehow. You rang? Yes, Lurch. I'm going to the bazaar and get Pugsley's clock back. I can't bear to see him and his father separated over such a silly thing. Oh, dear, I do hope the bazaar people will give it back. - Buy it back? - That's a marvelous idea, Lurch. Oh, but don't tell Mr. Addams. I want it to be a surprise. Yes, Mrs. Addams. Still looking for bargains, eh, Mr. Clayton? Well, the auction will start in about an hour. Well, nothing very exciting. Oh? What are you hiding back in that screen up there? Those must be the things the Addams family donated. - I don't know why Mr. Henson hid them. - Let's have a look. Well - Mr. Henson. - Don't be absurd. - The chin's much too strong. - Well, thank you. Excuse me, Mr. Clayton. Now, ladies and gentlemen, these are real conversation pieces. I direct your particular attention to the scrollwork. - Now, how much am I bid? - $10. Sold. The value of some of these things may not be apparent to the naked eye but if you look real close Well, I wouldn't advise that either. Anyway, let's get on with it. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to this rather unique collection of items. Let's first see what we have here. Yes, oh. There's always one practical joker at every bazaar. And now we come to this truly rare little number. Anyone care to offer anything for it? Anything at all? $10. Did I hear $10? - Going, going - $20. gone. $20? Oh. Perhaps you can't see it clearly. $30? $40. $50. $50? For this? - $60? - $70. Perhaps you'd like to come up here, where you can examine it more closely. Awfully spirited bidding for a worthless piece of junk. I think Henson's up to something. $100. $100 Well, I must say, you are a very charitable group. - 200. - 300. Dollars? Do I hear a five? Yes, the gentleman here in the front row says 500 Would anyone else care to bid $500? I'll give $1,000. Morticia. I'll give $1,100. Is that all? - Darling. - Querida. Very well, sold! To the gentleman over there for $1,100. I love you. Pugsley, darling, please. We tried. Won't you come down and talk it over? Come on down, Pugsley, lad. Darling, I don't think he should stay up there much longer. He might learn to love it. That's the way it went with Cousin Slosh. Down the city sewer in a fit of pique. Completely disowned the family. Made a whole new life for himself. Well, at least the bazaar people were happy. They never made so much money before. I still say we didn't get a fair chance at the bidding. Mr. Henson closed it so fast. But he's such a fragile man. Nothing but raw nerves. We were lucky to get Thing back on the first bid. Well, I know Uncle Fester's happy. Nobody bought his armor. Lots of people were interested but I discouraged them. Will you help me out of this thing? Somebody spilled pink lemonade all over me and I'm all stuck up. - I'll take a blowtorch to you later, Fester. - A blowtorch will roast me. Nonsense, the heat will put a nice crease in your cuisse. What are we going to do about Pugsley? Lurch, wonderful. Pugsley! Pugsley! Here's your clock! Oh, boy. Thanks, Dad. And how in the world did you ever get it away from Mr. Clayton? Did he sell it back to you? Gave me $5 to take it. Gomez, darling, it's been a long and difficult day. - It's time to retire. - You're right, my dear. I'm trying to synchronize these clocks. Pugsley complained that his was off three seconds. Probably got shaken up. Some people just don't know how to handle delicate timepieces. I think this ought to do it. Oh, dear. The poor thing's not well. Never fear, the old clockmaker is near. I think I'll try this one first. Perfect synchronization. 
Wonderful, darling. Such precision. It's not easy. Terrific. I wish that doctor could see him now. Doctor? You know, the one that said our family was unbalanced. Gomez has got plenty of balance. Just takes practice. As soon as I get a little more practice, then I'll unhook it. Well, Lurch, you may take it down now. I hope you have it perfected by Wednesday's birthday. We have plenty of surprises for Wednesday. For one thing, we're going to put on a play. A new drama by that great new dramatist, Tennessee Addams. And we're all going to be in it. Come with me to the casbah. Heathcliff, where are you? Lady Chatterley, I love you. By george, this house is a veritable cesspool of talent. Wednesday will be so thrilled. - Gomez, what's the play about? - Well, it's a most unusual plot. There's this young couple, Claude and Mabel. And they're in love. But their families are feuding and they refuse to let the young lovers get married. How delightfully tragic. Thank you, my dear. Well, there's no use telling you the rest. We'll have a play read. Places, please. Lurch, a little mood music. "And then he takes poison, "and then she takes poison. "And they both die happily ever after. " Oh, what a lovely finish, Gomez. Real togetherness. Quite a twist, eh? Well, now for the casting. Morticia, of course, will play the girl. Mama will play her mother. Fester Of course we want you in it, Cousin Itt. What would the play be without you? I just want to find the right part for you. Hey, Gomez, if you put this to music, he could play a Beatle. In fact, all four of them. - You need any singers? - No. No, there's no part for a sheepdog, either. Don't say that, Cousin Itt. You are not useless and good for nothing. You most certainly are good for something. We just don't know what it is. Gomez, darling, Cousin Itt's inferiority complex is getting worse all the time. I have it. Cousin Itt, you are going to be the star of our new play. The hero, Claude. I think I'm allergic to you. Here. You do? Isn't that amazing? He knows the part after only hearing it read once. Now, let's see. We'll start with the love scene at the top of Act Two. Claude, the hero, is looking up at Mabel's balcony, and says Marvelous. What feeling, what emotion. Such passion, such depth of feeling. Querida, play the scene with him. At the top of the balcony, go on. There, Act Two. Oh, thank you. "We must flee, my love. "If my father catches you here, "he will shoot you, kill you, and break your glasses. " Wait a minute. You changed one of my lines. That's different. Are you sure this part doesn't call for a taller man? Someone like me. No, Cousin Itt is perfection. But Uncle Fester, you could be the understudy. You mean, if something happens to him, like if he gets clobbered, I could play Claude? Of course. Itt. Let's go down to the playroom. We can rehearse together. Lurch, you can be the second understudy. That means if Cousin Itt can't make it, and something happens to Uncle Fester, you play Claude. Darling, I'm so happy. I think Cousin Itt has finally found himself. That isn't easy under all that hair. To make sure the play is a success, I'm going to hire a big director. - Where will you find a big director? - In the directory, where else? And I, Eric Von Bissell, will make the decisions. Remember that, Bennie. I am the director. You are only my agent. Okay, okay. Only just don't blow the job. How come this guy Addams to call you, anyhow? Probably remembered some of my more distinguished pictures. Pretty good memory. - When was your last one? 1932? - Never mind that. Addams says he has a great play and a great cast. This could be the start of an entirely new career. Fine start. I do not direct home-talent plays. Oh, what he means is that his fee is too high, Mr. Addams. I'll do better than that. I'll give him 50 thousand. - Dollars? - Dollars? I think there's $60,000 there. You can keep the change. Well, money isn't everything. My talent, my reputation. Excuse us just a moment, please. Come with me. - What do you think, my dear? - Don't worry, darling. When they read your play, they'll be dying to do it. Was Cousin Itt yelling for help? That's the scene from the third act, when Mabel's father is after him with a sword. My, he certainly makes it sound convincing. Well, he really puts feeling into it. Excuse me, my dear. Mr. Addams, my client has decided to do your play, after thinking it all over. I knew you'd come around, old man. Of course, this living room is hardly a Broadway theater. By george, you're right, this play should be on Broadway. What? Wednesday's party will serve as an out-of-town tryout. That does it. Get another director. - Think of the challenge. - No. - Think of the prestige. - No. - Think of the money. - I do it. - You rang? - Call Cousin Itt, will you, Lurch? - Gone. - Nonsense. Have Fester help you find him. - Gone, too. - Gone? But who'll play Claude? Me. Something is rotten in Denmark. Not in Denmark. In the playroom. Gomez, the old chest. Quick, open it up. Great Scott! I know you're shy, Cousin Itt, but this is ridiculous. Uncle Fester? How shocking. - Help! Get me out of here! Help. - Gomez, darling. Get me out of here. Uncle Fester, how could you do that to Cousin Itt? Him? What about me? Somebody grabbed me from behind and threw me in there and locked me up before I knew what was happening! I think I'm beginning to understand. Come out, Lurch. There will be no more of this. If anything happens to Cousin Itt the play is off. - Come. - Come along, Itt. Well? Oh, stop worrying about your reputation. Nobody's going to see this crummy play anyhow. That's right. Put it on and run like a thief. Gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We give you our star, Cousin Itt. What is that? - That's Cousin Itt, our leading man. - Really a new face, eh? New face? I don't see no face at all. - I am a director. Not a barber. - Von B. But a true artist overcomes all obstacles. Oh, Gomez, darling, I do so adore temperamental artists. Thank you, darling. Well, all right, let's run through the opening scene now. Mrs. Addams, will you please stand over there? You and that. Now, you're madly in love, but your father has forbidden you to marry him. And so you are telling Claude. - Go. - "Darling Claude, "my father has forbidden our nuptials. " Stop it! Stop it! - Is something wrong? - "Something wrong"? - Terrible! - Sounded fine to me. Oh, that's impossible. I will not work with such insanity! Please. Cousin Itt is very sensitive. Where'd he go? Where any sensitive artist would go when his feelings are wounded. Up the chimney. Come down, Cousin Itt. He didn't mean it. Oh, dear, now see what you've done. He likes it up there. Think of your career, your public Well, anyway, it was a soft answer. - Please tell him you're sorry. - Sorry for what? - Say it again. - 60,000 bucks. He looks like a raccoon and talks like a gopher, - but he has possibilities. - Thank you. Cousin Itt, did you hear that? I knew you wouldn't let a little clash of temperament wreck a great work of art. - Come on. - Gomez. Mr. Von Bissell may have a point. I do think Itt's voice is a bit too fast for the average listener. - I never noticed that. - Yes, I noticed it in that last scene we did. Perhaps we'd best take him down to the playroom and work on his voice. Bring out that fine timbre. Great idea, but we'll have to watch out for splinters. Now, let's try it once more, Cousin Itt. And slowly. "The rain in Spain "stays mainly on the plain. " No, no, no. Slower, Cousin Itt, much slower. Let's bring out those nice pear-shaped tones. Excuse me. Maybe he'd give us pear-shaped tones, if we gave him a pear-shaped head. That's a brilliant idea. Let's try it. Oh, not too much, dear, just a nice pear shape. There. That ought to do it. Now. "The rain in Spain "stays mainly on the plain. " Oh, dear, it's not a bit better. No wonder. I got the wrong end of him in here. His voice is much too high. I wish we could lower it. Maybe we should drop him down a well. Sorry, it was only a suggestion. Gomez, darling, I do remember reading somewhere where if you put marbles in your mouth, it gives you nice round tones. You're right, querida. Use mine. Here, Cousin Itt. Put these in your mouth. Now, let's try it again. "The rain in" They're delicious? But you're not supposed to eat them. Cousin Itt, they were my good dibbies! I won them off of Pugsley. Really, Cousin Itt. Now, here. - No, no, no. - Oh, no, darling, it's all right. Here, just put these in your mouth, and hold them. Let's try a new phrase. "The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch. " Yes. "The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch. " "ditch is mainly full of" By Jove, I think he's got it. No, now try it again, nice and easy. "The witch's ditch is mainly full of" Again. "The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch. " He has got it. "The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch!" "The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch. " "The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch. " "If you love me, gentle Claude, "I pray thee, tell me so. " Itt, we're waiting. - What's the getup for? - Lf you go Hollywood, go all the way. - Which one is their cousin? - Maybe both of them. Cue again. "I pray thee, tell me so. " "Lady, by yonder blessed moon" Pardon me. You may go out and play, Throckmorton. "Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, "that tips with silver all these dead treetops, "while vultures croak in ecstasy, "I dare to love thee, ere my head your father chops. " Bravo! Bravo! Von Bissell, a star is born. It's a miracle. It'll take more than a miracle. - But I'll try. - Good. Fester, get the cast together. All right, everybody. On stage. Come on, Itt, over there. Really, old man, you're not addressing a peasant, you know. You're speaking to the star. I shall inform you when I'm ready. "Soft! What light through yonder window breaks" If the play is a success he'll be absolutely impossible. Isn't that wonderful? Well, I think I'll go fix my makeup. Querida, use that baking powder number four. It looks absolutely magnificent on you. - Bubele. - That word. Darling, please. Bissell now, bubele later. Yes. And to think that I once directed for a producer like Sam Derrick. Sam Derrick! By Jove, there's a real producer. I can see it now. Derrick producing, you directing. Sure hit. I'll have my office draw up a contract and get him over here. Oh, no! Please. Oh, that would ruin me. Thank you, Thing. Hello, Addams here. I want you to get Sam Derrick, the big producer, over here immediately. Fine. He'll be here tomorrow. Von Bissell? Bennie? Then they just ran out the door and disappeared. Just as well. I was going to dismiss the old boy. Dismiss Von Bissell? He tended to limit my artistic capabilities. What do you mean by that, Lurch? Just That's quite enough. You may go to your room. I simply can't abide insolence. Dear, we've never had this sort of ill-feeling before. That's true, Itt. Besides, Lurch is much more than a servant around here. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to Mommy, Daddy. Hello, Wednesday, darling, welcome home. Did you enjoy school? Pugsley flunked spelling again. A real Addams. I didn't flunk anything. I was too excited about my birthday play. I'm sorry, child, you'll have to forget about the play. Forget about it? I have no time for that sort of foolishness. I've decided to do Hamlet for Mr. Derrick tomorrow. "It's a far, far better thing" No, that was Dickens. We'd better get some hair remover and see if that's really Itt under there. Darling, you run along and play. Everything is going to be all right. Oh, it's all my fault, Gomez. When I changed his voice, I changed his whole personality. Oh, it's not your fault, it's just It's just Well, come to think of it, it is your fault. If we could only get his sweet voice back again. I know he'd be his dear self. Morticia. These may help you get through to him. Oh, yes. Thank you, dear. So now I realize what a mistake it all was. - A mistake? - Yes, with your new voice, you sound just like any other actor. Mr. Derrick wants something new and different. You may have a point there. And your old voice was wonderful. We must get it back. It was so original, so different. That's true. I'm so glad you have an open mind about it. Well, we might just as well start now. Now, repeat after me. "The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain. " No, speed it up, Cousin Itt, speed it up. Now let's try a different phrase. Now, try that, very quickly. "The bats in hats stay mainly on the flats. " Rather silly expression, don't you think? Please let's try to concentrate, Cousin Itt. We must get your old voice back. Now. I'm sorry, my dear, but it simply won't come out that way. If you'll excuse me, I must rehearse. Big day tomorrow, you know. "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio. " "To be, or not to be, that is the question. " Poor Wednesday, she's so upset because Cousin Itt won't do the play. Itt will be on his way to Broadway tonight. I kind of hate to see the little pest go. Mr. Derrick. How do you do? I'm told you have an actor you want me to meet. Well, I am a very busy man. "To be, or not to be, that is the question. "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, "or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?" Amazing. Incredible! We leave for Hollywood tonight. - Hollywood? - But I thought Broadway was in New York. Madam, I am on my way out to Hollywood to do a picture. The Hairy Beast from the Mars Canals. And he'll be perfect in the title role. And we'll play it with no makeup. The Hairy Beast of Me? Play the Why, you Lurch! Follow me. But - Good old Cousin Itt. - He's his own sweet self again. Pugsley and I just traded dynamite caps. Uncle Fester, Gomez is writing a new play. "If you prick us, do we not bleed? "If you tickle us, do we not laugh? "If you poison us, do we not die? "If you wrong us, shall we not "revenge?" Wonderful, darling, sounds so original. Oh, oh, thank you. You should hear the big scene. This character, Charlie, can't pay back the $20 he owes. This other fellow, Pete, demands a pound of flesh. $20 for a pound of flesh? - Sounds fine to me. - It does? Yeah, you should go in the butcher shop and see the prices they're getting. That's true. Well, enough work for tonight. To bed, querida, to bed. Yes. To bed, darling. 
Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred. - There, that's that. - Thank you, Mother. That new cactus brush really makes my head feel nice and tingly. Well, I'm glad, darling. I'll just go upstairs and throw away your old porcupine-quill brush. - And thank you, darling. - My pleasure, cara mia. - In fact, why don't we go to 200? - No, thank you. You can't improve on perfection. Thanks to you, Fester. Thanks. And thank you, Thing. But I would suggest that you trim that scratcher. I think I detected a slight hangnail. Well! What was that all about? He'd be a real sorehead, if he had a head. Thing has been a bit off lately. Moody, he's morose. Hardly ever plays his castanets for us anymore. Tish, doing those fiery flamencos with you always made my blood run hot. Come, querida, let's do one now. Oh, no, darling, it's just not the same without Thing's castanets. I could click my teeth for you. No, Uncle Fester, I'm afraid you don't get the same beat. You don't have very musical molars. - Darling, why won't Thing play for us? - Who knows? Temperament. Mama. Has Thing been acting strangely lately? Why should I know? To me he's always strange. Wednesday? Fester? If you ask me, Claude Cuticle is a spoilsport. Darling, why is everyone so resentful of Thing? Well, he has been a bit stubborn of late. Can you imagine not wanting to play fast draw with the children? Well, would you if you couldn't say "bang" and win once in a while? - Lunch. - Oh, thank you, Lurch. And it's so nice that you're your same sweet, lovable self. Thing, Lurch has announced lunch. You may ring. Thing! Oh, he's really in a mood. I'll ring. Thing All right, Mr. Fingers, you asked for it. You know, Tish, there are some times I wish your name were something like "Oo-oo. " "Oo-oo?" It's almost impossible to blow smoke rings and spell out "Morticia. " Well, darling, it's the thought that counts. Lurch certainly outdid himself with that lunch. Marinated gizzard of lizard. En crouton. Still, it wasn't the same without Thing at the table. He's so handy for passing. And fanning hot soup. Oh, darling, do you remember the time he spilt the salt and he almost went mad trying to find a shoulder to throw it over? Now. It's odd. The one in the middle always comes out that way. - A spare leg could come in handy. - That's true. Oh, I see my roses need trimming again. No matter what I do those smelly petals keep growing back. Hand me my shears, please, Thing. Thank you, Thing, I knew you'd come around. Thing! - Oh, darling, I thought it was - Nonsense. Thing only likes to hold hands. You know, dear, I'm getting very concerned about him. I think we ought to find out what his trouble is. Capital idea. Thing? Come on, Thing, I want to have a man-to-hand talk. Thing? Thing? - Sounds empty. - I'm going to get to the bottom of this. If there is a bottom to it. Thing. Thing? Thing. Haven't seen Thing around, have you? I thought not. Find any clues? No, dear, but I found this in one of Thing's favorite boxes. Thing's parents. Probably their wedding picture. - Lovely couple. - Yes. Darling, doesn't it strike you as odd that Thing would go away - and leave a treasure like this behind? - Yes. I mean, he just wouldn't pack up and Darling, do you suppose Thing has met with foul play? - Exactly my thoughts, querida. - What are we going to do? The only thing we can do with a mystery. Solve it. I shall conduct an investigation immediately. Fingerprints! My own. Where were you on the night of March 3? - Gomez! - Sorry, my pet, I tend to get carried away. But we do have to chercher la femme. Tish, you know what you do when you speak French to me. Darling, please remember you're on a case. That's right. A case. Now, what was that about chercher la femme? An old saying I just made up. "Find the woman. " Oh, very clever. Then you do suspect me. No, my dear. The other femme in our house. The mischievous, petite femme. Wednesday Addams. I won't talk without a lawyer. She's a shrewd one. But the psychological effect of the hose makes them all crack. - How about you? - I claim the Fifth Amendment. - What's the Fifth Amendment? - Darling, you went to law school. I was absent that day. Hey, everybody. What's going on? Fester, I'm right in the middle of a very important interrogation. So that's what happened to the hose. Don't you know that the whole cellar's leaking all over the place? - Well, we found out one thing. - What's that? We need a plumber. - I'll fix it. - I'll help you. But I haven't finished my interrogation yet. - Interrogation? Whose? - Yours. Well, Thing and I had a slight brush. Is this what you call the third degree? - Is it getting to you? - Oh, yeah. Say, you can take it up to the fourth degree. Uncle Fester, please, you're not cooperating at all. What is it you wanna know? We want to know what happened to Thing. Well, why didn't you say so? Thing's disappeared. We know that. We want to know if Thing met with foul play. Well, the way Fingers has been acting lately, I'd call it fair play. Uncle Fester, how can you be so callous? I've been practicing. That does help. Say, why don't you question Mama? She and Thing had a terrible fight in the kitchen. They did? Mama. Thing ruined my blackbird pie, that's what he did. - Let them get away. - Let who get away? The blackbirds. All four and twenty of them. Insisted on helping Lurch pour the tea. - Lurch. - Of course. Lurch! It's always the butler. Lurch, I'll thank you to wipe that smile off your face. You seem pleased that Thing is gone. Thing gone? Well, I guess we're right back where we started. Sorry, old man. - Darling, why don't we call the police? - The police? Well, I suppose so. Just to handle the details. Of course, bubele. Tish, that word. Darling, remember you're on a case. You're right, a case. Operator? Please connect me with the police department. Well, of course it is. If your family Thing was missing, wouldn't you consider that an emergency? Hello, Police Department? This is Mrs. Addams. I'd like to report a missing Thing. What? Just a moment. Darling, shall I ask for the Burglary Division or Missing Persons? Well, that is a moot point. Find out if they have a Miscellaneous. But if it isn't a person, just what sort of a thing is it that's missing, Mrs. Addams? Is it a pet? Well, it's a family retainer. Oh, so it's a servant. Well, isn't that a person? Not necessarily. "Not" Well, have you got a picture of him? Yes, I believe we do. Just a moment. Darling, is that family portrait still around? Yes, but I'm afraid Thing isn't in it. Don't you remember? He took the picture. Look, lady, unless you can give me something more specific to go on, I'm sorry, but we can't be any help to you. Who cares? Run an ad in the Lost and Found. I found it in a vacant lot. When I saw your ad Oh, it's exquisite, but it's not our Thing. Think you could bear to part with it? - You mean you still want it? - Oh, yes. Name your price. - $2. 50? - $250? - No, I meant - Too late! It's a deal. You'll have to excuse my husband. He drives a very hard bargain. Business is business. Can't have you upping the price on us, old man. No, no, of course not. Thanks, thanks a lot. I'm on my way down to the dump now, and if I find any other bargains I'll let you know. You do that. Oh, we'll be days finding just the right spot for all these beautiful things. Certainly got a wonderful response to our ad. I'd give them all up for just one look at our Thing. This may be it. I certainly hope so. We're running out of room. - Special delivery. - Thank you, Lurch. Morticia, it's a ransom note. - A ransom note? You mean - He's been Thingnapped! "The ransom is to be paid at the stroke of midnight, "and do not call the law if you expect to get Thing back in one piece. " - Oh, Gomez! - Courage, my dear, courage. "Ransom is to be paid by a disinterested party. " I know just the one. That famous private detective. What's his name? - The one who always wears a trench coat? - Naturally. - And a snap-brim hat? - Yes, it's It's Sam, Sam! It's a figure on a card. - Sam Heart? - No, no. - Sam Club? - No. - Sam Diamond? - That's it! I'm Sam Diamond. Mr. Addams? No, follow me. Mr. Sam Diamond. How do you do, Mr. Diamond? I'm Mr. Addams and this is my lovely wife, Morticia. - How do you do? - Just make yourself at home. Home? Look, if this is some kind of a shady deal, forget it. Nonsense. We're the victims. - Who was it that got snatched? - Thing. Thing? - What was his last name? - Thing. Thing Thing? What kind of a name is that? - It fits him perfectly. - That's true. Signs himself, "Thing T. Thing. " And the "T" stands for - Thing. - Thing. Look, folks, kidnapping is a little bit out of my line. So if you'll excuse me Gomez, I do believe he's our man. The ransom note said "a disinterested party. " - He seems very disinterested. - Exactly. I'll weigh up the ransom. - Weigh up the ransom? - Oh, just a few precious stones. Thing is worth his weight in them, even with his thumb on the scale. We'll pay your fee with them, if you don't mind. Oh, I'm sure Mr. Diamond won't mind diamonds. No, no, no, it goes with the name. Did somebody mention diamond? What is that? That's Uncle Fester. We need him to open the safe for the ransom. Mr. Diamond. Well, let's get at it. You mean you don't know the combination to your own safe? Of course. Uncle Fester enjoys cracking it. It turns a mundane task into an adventure. You know, Gomez, you're gonna have to change the combination on that safe. It's getting too easy. I think next time I'll have it wired with nitro. Oh, boy, I'll get a bang out of that! Well, let's see what we have here. Well, I wondered what I'd done with that. Oh, darling, this bomb won't go off for another six months yet. I wish you wouldn't set them so far in advance. We tend to lose interest. Here we are. A few samples from our diamond mine. All of our really fine stones are cursed, of course. Been in the Addams family for generations. All right, you're putting me on with the rocks, aren't you? I mean, they couldn't possibly be real. - Au contraire. - Tish, there you go with that French again. I've warned you, I'm not responsible for my actions when you talk that way. Darling, please, we have a visitor. Later. Now, what's on your mind? I'm not sure. You did say you were going to pay my fee in gems. Oh, yes. Only too happy to unload a few. Now let's see. $8,402! I trust that's a satisfactory fee. Oh, sure, that'll be fine. - Now, what do I have to do? - Simply follow instructions. "The cemetery at midnight"? What could happen to me there? Don't answer that. I'll do it. Certainly inspires confidence, doesn't he? I thought all the dash and daring of those private detectives in the movies was an exaggeration. Cara mia, don't be so naive. The cinema is a reflection of life. Men like Sam Diamond are forceful, fearless and absolutely infallible. Diamond, old man! Back so soon? Thought you'd tarry to enjoy the moonlight. We usually do when we visit the cemetery. Dear Gomez, he's such a romantic. But where's Thing? Didn't you deliver the ransom? - As directed? - You put it on the last grave? And then suddenly, a hand, just a hand, reached up and snatched it away. A hand? I knew you wouldn't believe me, but it was a hand. A hand. - But we do believe you, old boy. - And it's wonderful. - Wonderful? - You made contact with Thing! You mean that was Thing? Dear, sweet, wonderful Thing. Oh, here. You take the fee. Just let me get out of here. Very sporting of him, wasn't it? Handling the case for nothing. I think we ought to send him a nice present. Yes. One of your man-eating plants, perhaps. The practical gifts are best. - Well, Thing ought to be along soon. - Yes. Oh, Thing, I'm so glad you're home. Wait a minute. Morticia, this whole thing is a hoax. What? You sent us that ransom note yourself, didn't you, Thing? - I thought the handwriting was familiar. - What's the big idea, Thing? Neglected Test us Wanted to see if we cared enough to ransom him back. Well, you got your answer. And Sam Diamond liked you so much he wouldn't even accept a fee. Some Things get a little spoiled. Well, darling, we have been neglecting him of late. Perhaps we should take him out. Thing loves music. Let's take him to a concert. Splendid. He can rattle along on his castanets. I'll call Lurch and have him get the car ready. - You rang? - The car, Lurch. And, oh, Lurch, we have a surprise for you. Aren't you going to let Thing know that you're glad he's back? There, Thing. That should make you feel right at home again. Thing. Thing. I brought you a little present just to show you there's no hard feelings. A nail file. For you. Hey, Fingers, just a little something to show you that I don't hold grudges. Gee, I was a beautiful baby. - Where are you going, to a masquerade? - To a concert. Boy, you sure look ridiculous. Fester, it's plain to see you have no sartorial savoir-faire. I resent that. Uncle Fester, now, dear, we haven't got time for that right now. Thing, we're ready. Oh, dear Thing. Now, Thing has sartorial savoir-faire. I'm glad, 'cause he sure dresses funny. Well, querida, we're off. - Tish, where will Thing ride? - Darling, where he always rides. In the glove compartment. 
they're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Uncle Fester, I need more power. Okay, Pugsley. I'll give you another 1,000 watts. HAPPY JOE ON RADlO: This is your broadcaster. This Happy Joe in Tokyo. -Fester, you've done it! -Darling, introduce me to your friend. Cemetery Kid to Happy Joe, I want you to say hello to my mother. -Hello, My Mother. -Hello, Happy Joe. -Tell me something about your country. -Not now. Big earthquake coming. Happy Joe gotta go. Isn't that a pity? Something ought to be done about those earthquakes. Infernal nuisance. I've got an SOS! MAN ON RADlO: Flight 714 from Calcutta-Rangoon in trouble over the Bay ofBengal. Any suggestions? Tell him to dump the passengers. Oh, no, he couldn't do that. Of course not, darling, they'd get soaked. Hello, Flight 714, this is Morticia Addams, and I have a helpful thought for you. Oh, good girl. Let's have it. When the plane hits the water, have each passenger attend to his own luggage. -lt'll avoid panic. -Thanks awfully. We're all right now. Good. Is there anything else I can do for you? Yes, sign off. Fine gratitude. Recognize it? No, I don't Oh, how could I have missed that fine, sensitive, drooping chin? -It's Uncle Flub. -Right, my dear. I caught him at that marvelous moment just before he starts to shake. Wonder why we never hear from old Flubby anymore? Simple, he can't write. That reminds me, shouldn't the mail be in by now? It will be. Briggs. You're not losing your nerve, are you, Briggs? About going in there? I always wanted to be an undercover man. I'm glad, because you're the only one who can get in there without arousing suspicion. Don't you worry about a thing, Mr. Hollister. I've seen all the James Bond movies. Good. Say, are you sure you're on the right track? The United States intelligence makes a point of never being too sure about anything. All we know is that coded radio messages have been coming out of there like popcorn. Coded radio messages? Gee. Like what? Well, like dynamite toys, man-eating plants and roaring cats. See if you can lay your hands on any writing. Get a hold of some of their correspondence. If I crack this case, maybe they'll make a movie about me. They might even move you up to Parcel Post. No mail? What is it, Thing? A joke? Morticia, he's trying to tell us something. Speak up, Thing. And stop stuttering. What is it? Darling, he's trying to tell us there's someone at the front door. You and Thing. Such perfect understanding. It's Mr. Briggs, our dear postman. -I thought the postman always rings twice. -You didn't even ring once. Can I come in? -Please do. -Allow me. Sorry our butler wasn't on hand to greet you. He's up in the attic feeding the vultures. Vultures? They're here already? -I better go. -Mr. Briggs, you haven't even said hello. Hello. You've got to stay, Mr. Briggs. -I do? -Yes. Well But l I do. What I really came in for was to look through your mail. I mean just the envelopes. I have a little grandson who collects stamps from strange places, and you people sure get mail from the strangest -As a matter of fact, Hollister thinks -Hollister? Yeah, Hollister. That's my little grandson. Say no more. What little Hollister wants, little Hollister gets. There you are. Any of the stamps you like, just help yourself. And if you wish, feel free to read the letters. There's an interesting one here from China on the decline in the fortune cookie industry. There's a lovely card from General Peron. He's still looking for work. -PUGSLEY: Mother! -Yes, darling, coming. If you want anything, we'll be in the code room. -Code room? -That's our new name for the playroom. Darling? Better watch that top letter, Briggs. It's from my favorite witch doctor. He's a tricky devil. Code room. I quit. I don't wanna be an undercover man, I don't even wanna be a postman. Easy, Briggs, easy. The United States Government is a good thing to have on your side. Not if they want me to stay at that spook house. What happened? You wouldn't believe it. What about the correspondence? The letters. Look, I don't wanna see another letter as long as I live. -You deliver them! -Now, easy, Briggs, easy. I've got to get someone sensible into that house. Yeah, well, why don't you try Conkey, the plumber? -Plumber? -Yeah, he's a sensible one all right. The Addams have been trying to get him for six months, and he won't go near the place. The plumber, eh? Thank you, Thing. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Addams. Oh, well, thank you very much, we'll be looking forward to seeing you. Goodbye. Darling, that was Mr. Conkey, the plumber. He's finally agreed to fix Kitty cat's drinking fountain. High time. He promised to do it six months ago. Oh, come on, Conkey, what can happen? I could get killed deader than a herring. In that case, you'd be buried with full military honors. Mr. Hollister, you make it sound so appealing. Oh, no, now just a minute. Look, with these walky-talkies, we'll be in constant contact. Now if anything should happen, all you have to do is holler. Yeah, if it's not too late. Nothing like the minuet to strengthen the wrist. Yes, it firms all those little wibbly-wobbles. I guess that's all for now. "lf girl get too firm, she turn to boy. " -Kipling. -Confucius. -There you are, Lurch. -Take them to the kitchen, Lurch. -Kitchen? -Yes, for the shish kebab. -I'll get it, my dear. -Thank you, darling. Shish kebab. Lurch! Lurch, don't forget the tenderizer. Have it. Morticia, he's here! This is our plumber, Mr. Conkey. Mr. Conkey, so good of you to come. Without his drinking fountain, Kitty cat just isn't his old playful self. -What's that? -Oh, that's Kitty cat. Roaring like that? If your drinking fountain was broken, you'd roar, too. -So long. -Lurch, please take Mr. Conkey's hat. Please, I don't think I got what I need for a job like this. What's that? Courage. Oh, come now, Mr. Conkey, no silly excuses. Come along. It's the second tunnel to your left, Mr. Conkey. Kitty cat's drinking fountain is just this side of the pit. All right, Mr. Snoop. Snoop? No, I'm Mr. Conkey. I'm only the plumber. A likely story. Get in that room. Move. Look what I found snooping around outside. -He claims he's a plumber. -But he is a plumber. He's fixing Kitty cat's drinking fountain. That's down in the basement. What's he doing sneaking around up here? That is a rather interesting question, Mr. Conkey. What are you doing up here? Well, I was just tracing the leak. Conkey, there are no pipes in the playroom. Playroom? I thought I was in the attic. Back to the basement, Mr. Conkey. If that's your real name. Come on. Move it out. So, you're a plumber, huh? Well, let's see you plumb. Morticia, wouldn't you say he's behaving rather strangely? -Uncle Fester? -Conkey. Oh, yes, he is behaving very strangely. Doesn't seem to know his attic from his basement. Okay, Conkey. Where are you now? I'm back in the basement again. Anything to report? Just this. If I get out of here alive, I'm never gonna complain about my union dues again. HOLLISTER: Conkey? -Don't do that. -Where are you now? How would I know? I didn't build this spook house. What are you gonna do next? Sign off and pray. -GOMEZ: Querida. -Here comes Mr. and Mrs. Weirdo. GOMEZ: Oh, yes. Their lunch. Poor Cleopatra, she must be famished. I had no idea it was so late. Time certainly flies when you're intellectually occupied. Darling? Gomez, what in the world could be the matter with her? She won't eat. She's in an absolute frenzy. Perhaps you should call a vet. For a plant? No. She's trying to tell us something. Mr. Conkey? What are you doing there? What's that in your hand? What's what? What hand? Is that a walky-talky? Oh, this. Oh, yeah, yeah. This? Yeah, yeah, this is a walky-talky. And whom were you walky-talkying to? Well, I was talking to Plumbing Central. Sometimes you get into trouble and you need help. And, boy, do I need help. Plumbing Central? Come in, Plumbing Central. This is Conkey. I need help. HOLLISTER: Plumbing Central? Conkey, have you flipped your wig? Very busy. Very busy down there. Are they really? Morticia, may I see you privately for a moment, please? I'll go. I'll go. No, no, Mr. Conkey. You stay right here and plumb. He's behaving even more strangely than the mailman. Yes. He seems very flighty for a plumber. If he is a plumber. -Come in, Hollister, this is Conkey. -HOLLISTER: Conkey, where are you now? I'm bailing out. You can't leave now. You gotta stay. I'm staying. I'm staying. I hate to bother you, old man, but there's something we have to check on. Yes. We don't mean to be rude, but could we see your union card? I still think you should have thrown him out. How could we? His union card was above reproach. Morticia, I don't feel safe with a nut like that running around the house. Forget the plumber. I've got to get through to Winthrop in Sumbawanga. -Darling, is it so urgent? -Absolutely. I must tell him not to mix the plutonium with the uranium shipments. Otherwise they'll never get here. Boy, that'd really knock the coconuts off the trees. Fester, you've got to give me more power. I'll try. Addams calling Winthrop. Addams calling Winthrop. CONKEY: Conkey calling Hollister. Conkey calling Hollister. Darling, you're on a party line. HOLLISTER ON RADlO: This is Hollister. Come in. Hollister, I need help. Lots of help! Isn't that nice? Mr. Conkey's finally contacted Plumbing Central. Conkey calling Hollister. Come in, Hollister. For God's sake, come in. I read you, Conkey. I read you. Don't read me. Just get me out of here. There's a lion in here! HOLLISTER: Now stop fooling around, Conkey. Your job is to find that communication center. CONKEY: My job is to find a way out of here. I got a secret door. Well, go in then. Go in. Say, Conkey. Maybe it's the radio room. That's right. It is. Conkey, just what are you doing? I'm leaving. Morticia, there's skullduggery going on in this house. That's right. You're letting all kinds of kooks in here. Darling, with your vast international interests, we can't afford to be too careful. I think we should call the authorities. Good thinking, my dear. This is a job for lntelligence. Well, don't look at me. I got to go get recharged. I have it. I'll call the CIO. Querida mia, not the CIO, ClA. Whatever you say, dear. I'll call Washington. They'll put us in touch with the proper authorities. Very good thinking, dear. Intrigue. Very intriguing. Well, you did your best, Conkey. Thanks anyway. Well, who pays the bill? 18 bucks? And one pair of lion-bit pants. What are they saying, Morticia? I spoke to the headman in Washington, who put me in touch with the regional director, who then put me in touch with the local director, who is now trying to connect me to the special agent in the field. You start at the top, you get action. I wouldn't worry about your breeches, Conkey. The government's good for them. Excuse me. Yes? Who? Mrs. Addams. Some strange things have been going on in this house. And we feel you ought to know about them. Dear Special Agent, of course we're ready to talk. Now just don't move a muscle, Mrs. Addams, I'll be right in. Over. Conkey, I don't know what you did, but they are ready to confess. Well, in case you need anything, Conkey Plumbing is out of business. Follow me. Badge Number 13. What a lovely coincidence. The same number as my perfume. -Perfume? -Yes. Quagmire Number 13. Mrs. Addams, I don't think you quite realize the serious situation that you're in. Oh, but I do. That's why we sent for you. Naturally. Of course, we don't like to implicate other people. Then you do admit there are other people involved? Of course. Let's see. There is Briggs, the postman. And Mr. Conkey, the plumber. Oh, please, Mrs. Addams, I planted those people here myself. You did? Then you must be involved in the ring. GOMEZ: I'd say he's the head of the ring. -I'm gonna have to make a citizen's arrest. -What do you mean, darling? What if he isn't a citizen? Now, look here. Of course I'm a citizen. Good. Then it's legal. You rang? Lurch, disarm this traitor and throw him in the lockup. Mrs. Addams, I appeal to you. This is no time Here! Just a minute. I work for the government. Hey, kid, get me out of here, will you? I can't. My father said you're to stay right there. Look, would you get me out if I gave you a pair of genuine undercover man's handcuffs? No. I already got a pair from a regular cop that was here once. Oh, it's time for me to send a message. Calling Anthony in Poland. This is Cleopatra, the man-eating plant. The Thing is ready. Repeat. The Thing is ready. Darn it. The set's gone dead. Do you mean to say that you're the one who's been making all these mystery calls? When we grow up we're all going to meet in Bulgaria and fight the gypsies from outer space. Oh, my God. The chief will never believe this. Well, old man. We owe you an apology. Yes, we called Washington and we found out you really are an undercover man. -I am? -Of course you are. Buck up, old man. There's lots of work to be done. MORTlClA: Of course there is. If it weren't for people like you, what would happen to people like us? I don't know. But why didn't it happen before I got here? Do have Lurch give you back your pistol. See, my dear. These old heirlooms come in handy. They certainly do, darling. Why, do you know three years ago, I almost gave this away to the Salvation Army? Darn nice of Ahmed Ben Pasha to send us this Turkish hookah. Does wonders for togetherness. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. There's 20 cents postage due. I wonder why Mr. Briggs didn't come in and get his money? He never does anymore. We must owe that man a fortune. I notice it's from a rest home. It says, "Thank you. If it weren't for you people, I wouldn't be here. " It's signed P. J. Hollister. I like a man who isn't too proud to be grateful. Yes. And it does make you thankful that our government men are so clever. Dear Mr. Hollister. We should send him something. I have it. Some of Mama's candied porcupine. The simple things are the best. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Good morning, Cleopatra. Here you are, darling. Don't gulp. Querida. Darling. Did you enjoy your breakfast? - Truly delectable. - I'm glad. I spent the whole morning gathering toadstools for your omelette. Allow me to express my appreciation with this new policy on my life, with you as sole beneficiary. How thoughtful, darling. A million dollars. What a nice round figure, bubele. Tish, you know what you do when you call me bubele. Darling, you've just had breakfast. You're right. There's a nice round double indemnity clause in that policy. Really? Sounds lovely. What does it mean? In case of accident you get twice the amount. I trust that won't put ideas in your head. Gomez! Merely a jest, my dear. I'm afraid I shall favor you with my presence for an exasperatingly long time with my new physical fitness program. Darling, where did you get the Indian clubs? Where does anyone get old Indian clubs? From an old Indian. Darling! Are you hurt? Gomez, are you all right? - Who's Gomez? - You are. - Bubele. - What's a bubele? This is dreadful. Has your memory been destroyed? I don't know. I don't remember. Oh, my poor darling. Please. I don't believe we've met. Gomez, I'm Morticia, your wife. - I'm married? - Of course. - To you? - Yes. Why are you wearing black? Darling, I always wear black. You said it was so becoming. I did? Are you sure we're married? Well, of Look, here's the insurance policy you bought for me, see? A million dollars. Well, I'm glad I have money. Here, darling, let me help you up. There. Now, your name is Gomez Addams. And you've just had your breakfast. And you're in your very own home. Very depressing. You don't like it? It looks like a museum that's been condemned. Oh, dear. I must do something to restore your mind. I was right! The house is falling. You rang? - What's that? - That's our butler, Lurch. Is it real or do you wind it up? Gomez! Mr. Addams seems to have lost his memory, Lurch. Perhaps a nice, hot cup of henbane? Henbane! Just give me a glass of milk. Milk? From a cow? There's no need to go that far. Moose milk will do. Never mind. Just tell your gargoyle to take off. He makes me nervous. Gomez, you hurt Lurch's feelings. Perhaps a nice visit with the children would soothe you. Children? What children? Our children, dear. Madam, are you suggesting - that we've been more than friends? - Gomez, we're married. Oh, I forgot. Come along, dear. Children, say hello to your father. - Hello, Father. - Hello, Father. How do you do? Go right ahead with your playing. We don't want to disturb you. Surely you recognize your own offspring? No, but the girl does resemble you. And Pugsley is the image of you. - He is? - Naturally. Look in the mirror. I'm afraid. What the devil is that? That's Lucifer, my pet. He's nice and slippery. I'm going to get you a lovely, golden-haired doll that says "mama. " But what have I done? - Nothing. - Then why are you punishing me? I'm not punishing you. I just want you to get rid of that ghastly bug. Yes, yes, dear. Pugsley, why don't you show your father what you can do with the trains. Watch this, Father. Swell wreck, wasn't it? Swell wreck? The boy needs help. Until you pay for those trains, I am cutting off your allowance. But I don't get any allowance. Starting today, you'll get an allowance so I can cut it off. There's a touch of madness around here. Children, your father isn't himself. And until he gets better we're just going to have to humor him. - We understand. - Father's flipped! Pugsley! I'm afraid you're right. - Why do you keep staring at me? - Doesn't everyone? I'm so glad to see you and Uncle Fester having such a nice chat. Uncle Fester. From your side of the family, I hope. You'll have to excuse him, Uncle Fester. He's had a lapse of memory. And a bad shock. Several bad shocks. What he needs is a good workout in the playroom. A half an hour on the bed of nails and you'll be in as good a shape as I am. Now I'm worried. Come along, darling. It might do you some good. Come along. This is the playroom? Of course. A place of joy and laughter. - He's not laughing. - Lurch holds his laughter inside. Let it out, Lurch. Put it back, Lurch. How's your headache, Uncle Fester? A couple more turns ought to do it. Darling, you've always loved this room. Don't you like it now? It has its points. Well, this is an interesting old woodcarving. - Me, a woodcarving? - It's alive! Mama, he's had a lapse of memory. I'm thinking of putting him on the rack. Good idea. A few twists might straighten him out. A few twists? Yes, darling. You see, we tie your hands and your feet and then Lurch turns the crank. - And that will make me better? - And taller, too. You're trying to kill me. - Oh, no, darling. - Get that double indemnity No, no, no. You're dearer to me than all the bats in all the caves in the world. Now trust me, Gomez. All right. But I'm not going on that rack. All right, darling, you don't have to. Perhaps if you took part in some simple household routine, it would do more to bring your memory back. I have it. Would you like to help me feed the plants? - Yes, that sounds harmless enough. - All right. - Mama, would you care to join us? - No, I can't. I have to stay in the stock another hour. It's my beauty treatment. Better make that two hours. - Go ahead, darling, feed her. - With hamburgers? What else? Go on. - That thing tried to eat me. - Nonsense. Humans give her terrible heartburn. Show Father how much you love him, Cleopatra. It's choking me. Nonsense. She's embracing you. You're trying to kill me! To get that insurance money. Oh, Cleopatra. I know, darling. I know how it feels to be scorned. You must believe me, Gomez. I would no more harm you than a vulture in its nest. Vultures! Are they circling already? Of course not, bubele. Don't call me that ridiculous name. It used to thrill you. It would turn you into a fiery furnace of affection. Impossible. Let's recapture those mad moments, Gomez. Kiss my arm. Your arm? Darling, I'm yours. From shoulder to knuckle. Isn't that rather unsanitary? I must awaken you, Gomez. And I will. Not in that absurd outfit. - Darling - No offense, but something must be done about your clothes. - Just your type. - Oh, no, Gomez, please. He's sicker than I thought. You don't like my presents? Oh, darling, of course. I always love your presents. It's just that they're so expensive. Well, certainly they're expensive. But it's worth it to see my wife dressed properly. Son, why don't you go lie down for a while? You're not well. Nonsense! Never felt better in my life. I shopped like mad. Beautiful, isn't it? I think I better go lie down. They're all so lovely. I don't know which to try on first. Well, perhaps I have overdone it a bit. Yes. I need time to absorb your generosity and to think about it. Lurch, would you put these things upstairs in my room? I'll try them on later. Darling, why don't you relax? It's not very easy to relax around here. Well, of course it is. Stand on your head. He's even talking of chopping down my beautiful African strangler. Kill Cleopatra? - That's murder! - Father wouldn't do that. Your father's ill, dear. He doesn't know what he's saying. I just don't know what to do. I'd hoped one of you might have a suggestion. How about a little heat therapy? That might snap him out of it. I could boil some oil and dip his head in it. No, no, you did that for his migraine, remember? It just made him hotheaded. Yes, Thing. What is it? Do you have an idea? Oh, no, no. I read about that, too, but I couldn't do it, I just couldn't. Do what? It's here, in Grandpa Squint's old medical book. I marked it. See? "When amnesia is caused by a blow on the head, "it can sometimes be cured by giving the victim a similar blow. " But I could never do that to Gomez. We'll just have to wait and hope that he comes to his senses before he destroys our beautiful way of life. I never thought anyone in this family'd go nutty. Well, maybe he'll be better when we get back, honey. I'm taking the children to the movies to see The Batwoman From Outer Space. - They love those true-life stories. - Lovely, Mama. Children, you run along now. But take the back door and don't disturb your dear father. - Oh, goody, goody. - Oh, goody, goody. FESTER: Morticia can't do it, huh? If it'll make Gomez well, I can do it. I love that boy but I'll clobber him. Well, hello there, Fester. - Didn't hear you come in. - I sneaked in. Must have dozed off. Fell out of the chair. - How do you feel? - Fine. Never felt better in my life. You're looking mighty good today. Handsome as usual. - Where's Morticia? - I'll call her. Morticia! Morticia! Oh, Gomez, darling, I was going to try on these dresses but I didn't know which one you wanted to see first. Great jumping catfish! Where did you find those monstrosities? - Find them? But - Never mind where they came from. Put them back, cara mia. Please. Oh, yes, Gomez, darling, yes, I will. - I'm so happy. - Querida mía. - I'll be right back down. - Cara. LURCH: It's for his own good. Gomez, darling. I thought I'd bring these things all downstairs and then call a junkman to come and get them. Junkman? For your new clothes? Well, since you've told me to get rid of them, I thought No, no, my dear. I said get rid of that horrible black thing. - But, bubele? - Not bubele. Very well, Mr. Addams. GOMEZ: I Perhaps, I'm too strict with you, my dear. After all, you are my wife. Yes, and it isn't easy. So you may call me "honey bun. " Or "doll boy. " MORTICIA: Doll boy. Oh, he is sick. Now run upstairs and get rid of that black thing and put on some proper clothing. If this goes on much longer, the proper clothing for me will be a straitjacket. Very well doll boy. (WHISPERS) Doesn't seem a bit better, does he? You children go play. I've got things to do. You mean hit my own father with an Indian club? - It's for his own good. - Then you do it. - He might get mad at me. - He might get mad at me, too. But while Father is ill, you're the head of the family. Hand me that club. Gomez darling, you don't know what it means to me to have you well again. Well? I'm always well when I'm with you, cara mia. Later, darling, later. Later. Right now, I'm starved. Anything your heart desires. How about some of that nice baked iguana? Capital! An iguana sandwich and a steaming cup of pinecone nectar. Darling, you go right over here and you sit down and make yourself comfortable. I want to fix it myself. Querida. There he is. In the chair. - What if he sees us? - I'll take care of that. - Hello, Father. - Hello there. - I have a surprise for you. - Good, I love surprises. - Close your eyes. - All right. - Keep them closed real tight. - I will. I'm sorry it took so long, darling. But I wanted everything to be just so. - Is there something wrong? - I just had a dizzy spell or something. Well, this will fix you up. - What's that? - Why, it's your lunch, darling. Baked iguana and pinecone nectar. Good heavens! Of all the nauseating-Iooking concoctions. - Are you trying to poison me? - Darling, don't even Oh, no, you're sick again. Now what am I going to do? Well, for one thing, you could bring me some decent food. A hot dog with chili on it, a bottle of orange pop, and a slab of apple pie with cheese. Oh, Gomez! That's all it says, Uncle Fester. "A blow on the head. " You must have done it incorrectly. You know, I thought I did it real good. He seemed well after I belted him. He was for a while, but it just didn't last. There's only one thing left to do. Oh, boy! Hit him again. This time I'll belt him No, Uncle Fester, this time I'll do it. But I'll need your help. I'll hold him for you. I can't do it. I can't bear the look on his face when I hit him. - Should I put a sack over his head? - No. No, I have a much better idea. You know those long drapes in the living room? Sure. You tell him that you're playing a game with the children and then get him to hide behind them out of sight. Oh, boy, this sounds like fun! That way I can give him the club treatment without looking at his dear, sweet face. There he is. I'll get him behind the drapes, then you conk him good. - I hope it works this time. - So do I. His poor head must be getting lumpy. Yeah, but on him it looks good. Hi, Gomez. I've been looking all over for you. The children and I are gonna play hide-and-seek. - Would you care to join us? - I'm busy. Come on, Gomez, you need the relaxation. - All right, all right. - Come on. Come on. - I'll play. - Good. Now we'll hide over there behind the drapes. They'll never find us. Come on, now, you take this side. Over here, like that. And I'll get in here. - Are you ready, Gomez? - GOMEZ: Ready. FESTER: We're ready! Darling, forgive me. - What in the world did you do to Fester? - Gomez! I thought it was you! Me? You thought I was right. You are trying to kill me. No, darling, I'm only trying to make you well. - With a club? - Yes! - You want that insurance money. - No! You won't get me! I'm getting out of here! My poor, battered, wounded love. Speak to me. Ah, querida. Darling, you're well at last. Bubele. A little harder, Thing. That's it. Nothing takes the knots off a man's head like sandpaper. Dear Thing. He has such a gentle touch. That fire smells good. What are we burning? Your Indian clubs. If I did half the things you said I did, I must have been a sick, sick man. Thanks to you, cara mia, I'm all well now. You really should thank Uncle Fester, dear. Thank you, Fester. Who's Fester? Oh, no. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Lovely! Wait till you see how it really works. Will you hand me another log, Fester? Thank you. Are you sure it's gonna work? Well, there's only one way to find out. - All set, querida? - Any time you're ready, darling. All right. Ready. Aim. Fire! I don't know how we ever got along without a flamethrower. No housewife should be without one. Think of the savings in matches alone. Not to mention the efficiency. Instant yak! Toasted. - Morticia, can I try it once, please? - Of course, dear. I'll give you something really to shoot at. Pardon me. Okay, light the cigar. Gomez, dear, aren't you being a little reckless? Not at all. It's only a nickel cigar. Steady, Gomez! Uncle Fester, you have nerves of steel. Now, only if his hand would stop shaking. Don't you worry about me. All right, Morticia, give me the countdown. Ready. Aim. Fire. Gadzooks, Fester! You set the stuffed bear on fire. Maybe I should have had it on low instead of high. You rang? Yes, Lurch, would you bring a bucket of water, please? Yes, Mrs. Addams. By george, you have to admire Lurch. Never panics. Thank you, Lurch. Well, I'm afraid we're a bit late. Dear old Smokey. Up in smoke. He was a great burner. Just after I spent all morning polishing his fur up. Polishing his Uncle Fester. Did you use the E-Z Clean? I thought you said kerosene. Natural enough mistake. Yes, and besides we have plenty of insurance coverage for normal household accidents. Of course. The insurance company must have thousands of claims from badly-aimed flamethrowers. Hello. Double Indemnity Insurance Company? I'd like to speak to your manager, Mr. Henson, please. A. J. Henson speaking. I'd like to report a household accident. Damage from a burn. A cigarette burn? No. A bear burn. Was the bear smoking? Hardly at all, and he went up just like that. Madam, will you please give me your name? Morticia Addams. Digby, come in here this minute. Did I or did I not tell you to cancel all the Addams' policies? And I did just that, sir. Their life insurance, car insurance, hurricane insurance, - endowment to the college - Household accidents? Household Oh, dear. That one I forgot. Wait. It always opens by itself. Well, open it. Let me see. Come. Follow me. Good luck, Digby. That's 30 for Thing and none for you, dear. Really, I thought I beat him once. No, darling. It was I who beat him. Mr. Digby. Double Indemnity. Good to see you again, Digby. You remember my wife? No one forgets Mrs. Addams. Now, about your claim. Could I see this bear you burned? Of course. There he is, poor dear. Just a cinder of his former self. I don't want to quibble, but how do I know that was a bear? Well, let's use simple logic. - Does it look like an antelope? - No. - A zebra? - No. - A giraffe? - No. - An elephant? - No. A tiger. - No. - A camel? No! - A gorilla? - Well No. No. Well, then it must be a bear. Querida, with your incisive mind, you should be on the Supreme Court. I do love those black robes. Look, I hate to quibble. How much money will you settle for? Digby, don't be vulgar, we don't want money. What we want is another bear. What else could possibly go with our decor? A bear may be a little hard to come by. - How about a lion? - We already have one. Stuffed? Well, he is after he's had his dinner. Speak of food and here's Kitty cat. Excuse me. Well, that was rather abrupt. He was in a hurry to settle our claim. Excellent service. Darling. Read some more of Mr. Poe. He's so exciting. Certainly makes the blood rush to one's head. "Once upon a midnight dreary "while I pondered, weak and weary "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore "While I nodded, nearly napping "suddenly there came a tapping "As of someone gently rapping "rapping" - Is that someone rapping? - I can't tell if it's rapping or tapping. Querida, do you suppose it could be the raven? I don't think so, dear. This rapping seems to be coming on a window. And according to Mr. Poe, ravens rap at doors. Maybe this bird's a little confused. - Darling, it is a raven. - Looks exactly like Digby. By george, it is Digby. Digby, old man. We're not accustomed to people lurking about our windows. Is the lion around? - No, he's asleep. - We'll wake him if you like. No. No, please! Well, speak up, old man, do you have our bear or haven't you? Well, yes and no. I like a man who comes right to the point. Mr. Addams, we simply can't find a bear that big. That's absurd, there are thousands of them running all over Alaska. That's what he said. "There are thousands of them running all over Alaska. " If we gave people everything they want, we would soon be out of business. Digby, there are two ends to running the insurance game, taking the money in and refusing to pay it out. Maybe you'd better talk to him. We'll go over there together. Old Loophole Henson will show you how to handle troublemakers. How sweet of you, Mr. Henson, to take this personal interest in our little problem. Oh, we believe in the personal touch, dear Mrs. Addams. No matter how ridiculous the claim may be. I know just what you mean, Henson. Would you mind reenacting the accident? Not at all. Fester? Hi. I didn't know we had company. These gentlemen are here about our insurance claim, Uncle Fester. Take your firing position, Fester. Henson, if you'll just step this way, I'll show you exactly what happened. Now, I was standing right where you are, the cigar in my mouth, and Mrs. Addams uttered those fatal words. Ready. Aim. Fire. This is outrageous! Certainly is. Fester, you missed that cigar by a good two inches. Why, there isn't a policy in the world that covers a flamethrower. Oh, that's not quite true, sir. As it says right here in paragraph 42, subhead 18, fine print, article 12, "Fire is fire. " Oh, I am glad you mentioned that, Digby. You're fired! And so far as your policy is concerned, sir Gomez, I have a feeling he isn't going to pay. Nonsense. He's just playing hard to get. Well, anybody got the want ads handy? Don't worry, Mr. Digby, we're going to help you. Now I'm worried. We're going to take you under our wing. Have a cigar. The executive type if I ever saw one. A perfect hit! Congratulations, Digby. You are now in our hands. Digby? Digby, I'm talking to you. Oh, darling, these executive types. The mere smell of success goes right to their heads. It's no use. I can't bring him to. Uncle Fester, do you think you're charged up enough to do this? I'll give it a whirl. Don't, don't. I'm innocent. Pull your self together, old man. Must have been a dream. I thought I was in the electric chair. The chair isn't electric. But Uncle Fester is. Yeah, I'm really hot today. - Let me out of here. - Relax, Digby, you're among friends. Please. Call my enemies. I got to get out of here and find a job. That won't be necessary, you can go to work in any of my far-flung enterprises. How far-flung are they? Oh, Africa. Asia Minor. Asia Major. Haven't you something a little further? You name it, we've got it. Before you make your decision, you should see all the opportunities. You rang? Yes, Lurch. Please bring the projector. We want to show Mr. Digby some opportunities. Ready, Lurch? Ready, Mrs. Addams. Action. Camera. There's my mango plantation. Lovely location. Right next door to the most charming colony of cannibals. Cannibals? Well, they're really nice fellas once you get to know them. They keep inviting us over for lunch. As guests? As dessert. There's a real opportunity there for a go-getter. Job of superintendent is wide open. What happened to the last one? Dessert? I don't know for sure. He was such a sweet man. Dessert! Well, if the mango business doesn't appeal to you, here's my crocodile farm in Mozambique. I've got a real opening there. I don't think I care for that opening. Gomez, darling, Mr. Digby's right. He needs something where he can rise right to the top. I've got just the thing coming up. My tapioca mines on the top of Mount Everest. Now, the transportation is a bit tricky, but once you get up there, it's a veritable fairyland. How do you get the tapioca down? You've hit the problem right on the head, Digby. That's why we need a new manager. Well, Digby, which one would you like to shoot for? With opportunities like that, I'll think I'll shoot myself. Too many opportunities. Too confusing? Well, look, you just go home and think about it. I'll think about it at the unemployment office. Poor man. Fifteen minutes of unemployment and he's completely unhinged. I have it. I'll set him up in his own business. - An insurance company? - Excellent idea, my dear. I'll capitalize with $500,000 and amortize the principal over a 10-year period. Darling, what does that mean? Who knows? That's the way I run all my enterprises. Sometimes, simple faith is best. - You rang? - Yes, Lurch. We're going to open the Digby Insurance Company. We want you to prepare a full-page ad for this afternoon's newspapers. What shall I say? Well, use your own judgment, Lurch. You have a wonderful flair with words. Let yourself go, be lyrical. With enthusiasm like that, how can we miss? Follow me. Well, Digby. What do you think? It's such a proud moment for him, he's speechless. I can't do this. Nonsense, old man, it's no trouble to help a friend. What kind of a setup is this, anyway? Efficiency. Everything under one roof. There's our head of personnel and incoming calls. Allow me to introduce our chief medical examiner. There's our actuary and expert on life expectancy. Really tight-knit organization. - Any suggestions? - Just one. Would you please take my name off the sign outside? Now, now, Mr. Digby. You'll never get anywhere being a shrinking violet. Thank you, Thing. Hello, Digby Insurance Company. Morticia Addams speaking. Well, we'd be happy to insure you. You've been turned down by 17 other insurance companies? And you're only 96? Sheer prejudice. Have someone wheel you over and we'll give you full coverage. How is that for bringing in the business? You'll have every insurance reject in town over here. Exactly, that's what we're specializing in, the forgotten man. There's a perfect example, Digby. Would you believe it? That strapping young fellow has been rejected by every insurance agency in the country. How true, Cousin Itt. And by Canada and South America as well. And why? - Maybe he couldn't pass the eye test. - Nonsense! He merely wears those glasses so people won't pester him for autographs. We not only insured him, we made him a member of the staff. He's in charge of small claims. Customer. Mrs. Addams, would you take care of the gentleman, please? Yes, Mr. Addams. Yes, sir, may I help you? I would like to take out some insurance. Life, fire, theft or earthquake? Life. What are your rates? That depends on what kind of dishes you prefer. Right! The higher the prices of the dishes, the lower the premium, or something like that. If you don't care for dishes, we can arrange to give you a 3% dividend. Provided you pass the medical exam. Right this way, sir. Well, Fester. What do you think? I think with that beard, he needs fire insurance. Sit down, please. Now, cough. Again. Once more. You have a bad cough. - Well, what's the prognosis? - He needs a doctor. Will the gentleman live? He has a chance. Congratulations, sir, you've just passed the medical. Now, if you'll just step this way, we'll see about your life expectancy. Crystal ball, crystal ball, what do you say? Will he live for 20 years or only a day? Well, Mama. What do you see? I see an imposter. Mr. Henson, what are you doing here? That's perfectly obvious, Digby. He's here to spy on our advanced business methods. Just for that, Mr. Henson, no dishes. Well, you can keep your dishes and you can keep your policy. I was a little worried about the competition. But this? This is absurd. I've got the goods on this whole operation. And as for you, Digby, I'll have you in jail for 40 years. Don't worry, Digby. I am also an attorney. We'll fight this to the bitter end. You are a very lucky man, Mr. Digby. My husband hasn't lost a case in ten years. Or was that ten days? I'll have to check my records. Well, don't bother. Because you are not going to be the attorney in this case, you are going to be the defendant. I'll have you and your whole family in jail. We'd better make a run for it. Nonsense, Uncle Fester. This is sheer intimidation. The Better Business Bureau will hear about this. It certainly will. Henson, just a moment. In that case, I'm afraid I'm gonna be forced to cancel my industrial insurance with your company. What industrial insurance? Mangoes Incorporated. Tapioca Limited. Crocodiles Unlimited. Darling, you forgot Amalgamated Swamp and your buzzard farm. You control all those companies? Give or take a few. Wait a minute, if you pull all that business away from me, I'll be ruined. We could give you a job with Digby Insurance. After all, this whole thing is just a little bit of a misunderstanding. I mean, surely there must be something I could do to make up to you. Well, that depends on Digby here. All I want is my old job back. And all we want is a decent replacement for our lovely bear. It's a deal. Well, Digby, you're rehired. Oh, thank you, what's my first assignment? Alaska! We're going to get these wonderful people the biggest bear we can bag. Isn't it marvelous, darling, how people cooperate once they understand the problem? You have to hand it to Henson. He really came through with a beautiful bear. Yes. It's too bad about his little accident. Well, you have to watch out for those avalanches in bear country. Still, he is lucky. He's in the best hospital in Anchorage. Gomez, would you come here a second? Would you help me fix this flamethrower? What's the problem? Oh, I don't know. It's stuck. Okay, you try pushing down the trigger and I'll look down the barrel and try to see what's wrong. It's stuck, all right. Oh, silly me. I forgot to release it. The safety catch. Operator, would you get me the Seaside Hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, please? Hello, Seaside Hospital? May I speak with Mr. Henson? Well, can't you take him out of traction long enough to answer the phone? Mr. Henson? This is Morticia Addams. I hate to bother you at a time like this, but I have to report another little accident. Mr. Henson? Mr. Henson? Oh, dear. I am afraid he's had another relapse. 
My dear, the hot coals are ready. Uncle Fester, are you ready? Well Make sure they're good and hot. Thank you, Lurch. Good man. Uncle Fester, are you sure you want to go through with this? Well You said you'd go through fire for me, old man. But not in my bare feet. It's nothing to fear. Purely a question of mind over matter. Well, in that case Oh, this is hot! - Bravo, bravo! - By golly, you did it! - After only one lesson of Zen-Yogi. - Yeah. Oh, darling, with such an inspired instructor as you, anything is possible. While they're still hot, I might as well take a stroll through myself. Nothing to it, once you've mastered concentration. How true, darling, how true. But next time, why don't you try it with your shoes off? A mere technicality. You're spoiling me, Morticia. An Indian for each length. Well, darling, you've always said I was an Indian giver. Now I've proved it. Good cigar. - Hello, Father. - Children, home from Where are you home from? Oh, yes, you're home from school. How are things down at the old brain factory? - Are you sure you wanna know? - Certainly. We're your parents. - Aren't we? - Of course we are, darling. Look at the family resemblance. Now, what seems to be the difficulty? A little problem in trigonometry? Calculus? Nuclear fission? Anything I can't handle, your mother can. - It's not that at all. - It's these books they make us read. Oh, I do hope they're not teaching you about the birds and the bees? Yes, plenty of time for that later. On the other hand Gomez! Run along, children. Oh, darling, it's even worse than we thought. Look at this. The Wicked Goblin. That's ridiculous. I never met a goblin I didn't like. Oh, dear, I don't think I can even bear to read the title of this one. You must. If the children can stand it, so can I. How Sir Lancelot Slew the Evil Giant. It's outrageous. Who ever heard of an evil giant? Of course, a giant is simply an oversized pygmy. Read the title of the other one. Oh, dear. How Pamela Escaped from the Wicked Witch. Oh, I wish I hadn't asked. Imagine, poisoning a child's mind with all this terrible literature. - Children, have you protested? - Sure. We told Miss Doubleday that us Addamses like giants, goblins and witches. But she just muttered something about nuts. "Nuts"? That does it. We'll march to the board of education. We'll picket the PTA. Darling, we've complained before. It doesn't do any good. The abuses just continue. What can we do? Besides, the poor educators are probably doing the best they can. If they had better books, I'm sure they'd use them. - Probably. - The point is, - someone has to write them. - But who? You? Oh, no, I couldn't. But then again, why not? With your busy schedule, you'd dedicate yourself to the task of creating a new literature for children? Darling, this is very important. It must be done. What a sacrifice! This is a red-letter day for book-Iovers. You have to work down here in the cave? The closest thing we have to a Ionely garret. Then why not use the garret? Lurch likes to use it for his clay-modeling. Darling, why don't you turn off the echo? Thing. Thank you, Thing. Now then, I'll just bring in a cot, and sleep over there. Oh, no, darling, you'll interfere with my work. That's the idea. All work and no play All work and no play gets books done. - But you'll need literary advice. - I'll ask Cousin Cackle. You see? He's just dying to give advice. Cackle's been in this cave for 30 years. What does he know about the world? Darling, a man who's lived in a cave for 30 years certainly has had a lot of time to think. Well, I guess the first thing I'll need is a title. Why, thank you, Thing. That's a lovely title. The Good Giant Slays Wicked Sir Lancelot. Thank you. - Will I see you at dinner? - Oh, I doubt it, dear. I'll probably just munch some jimsonweed, and work right through the night. Well, in that case - Aloha. - Aloha, bubele. - You know what that name does to me. - Darling, please. Book, now. Bubele, later. Sorry. This is how Louisa May Alcott must have looked, when she started Little Women. Well, I've started. Only 300 more pages to go. - We've cleared out at least three shelves. - Aren't you going a bit overboard? - Morticia's only started her first book. - You have to look ahead. Once Morticia gets rolling, we'll have to clear out every shelf in the house. - Dickens, too? - I'm afraid so, Lurch. - Everyone has to do his part. - How long has Morticia been on this? Exactly two days, But every one, well worth it. Oh, thank you, Thing. I can see it all now. "Morticia Addams, the new literary sensation. " Traveling all over the world, drinking it up at those literary teas. Making speeches, signing autographs, telling off the critics. We might not even see her for six months at a time. - Six months? - Oh, maybe even six years. But as long as it's for humanity, - who cares? - I care. - Lf the girl travels, I'm going with her. - You can't do that. Somebody's gotta stay at home and take care of the kids. - What about you? - Oh, I can take care of myself. - Can't you look after the children? - Sorry, I'll be too busy answering Morticia's fan letters. And besides, they're your kids. Gadzooks! I may have created a Frankenstein. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Morticia. - Querida, I must talk to you. - Oh, of course, that's it. That's what comes next. "The "End. " Thank you so much, Thing. My fingers were getting numb. Oh, darling, you're just in time. My first book, all ready for publication. - Wonderful. - And just think, it only took me two days, 10 hours and Don't you realize we've hardly had a word together for days? Well, let's talk now, dear. I'm taking a 10-minute break between books. In that case, let's not waste a second. Gomez, darling, don't you want to talk about my book? Oh, yes. The book. My first story, Cinderella the Teenage Delinquent. Cinderella My blood boils when I think of that little minx. Gomez, can you imagine? Those two Good Samaritans take her in off the street, and what does she do? The night they need her the most, she runs off in a pumpkin. - How did you right that wrong? - Simple. Here. "As the clock struck 12:00, the police summoned by the kindly stepmother "found Cinderella cowering in the ashes, with a stolen glass slipper, "and yanked her off to the pokey. " Cara mia! You've done it. This'll open the eyes of school librarians everywhere. Oh, darling, I'm sorry. Your 10 minutes are up. Back to work. Dear, would you please proofread that and send it off to a publisher? - Which one? - Try Demon Press. They sound just perfect for children's books. Thank you, Thing. Thanks again, Thing. What's the matter, Gomez? Fester, you've caught me on the horns of a dilemma. Well, why don't you hop off of it, and just tell me all about it? I'm supposed to mail this manuscript to Morticia's publisher, but I don't dare. - It's that bad, huh? - It's that good. Once he sees this, I've lost her forever. There'll be nothing but abject misery for both of us and the children. - So just don't mail it. - I can't do that, she trusts me. - That makes it easier. - Out of the question. - I got a better idea. - What's that? Why don't you just change it a little bit, so the publisher won't like it? Tamper with this masterpiece? Fester, that's like asking me to put a mustache on the Mona Lisa. Or put plastic arms on Venus. Or finger-paint on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. - Okay, it was just a suggestion. - And a great one. I'll do it. A more miserable man never roamed this earth. You can be miserable, all right. But for now, will you relax? - How can I? - Please. I'll try. Much better. It's no use, Fester. Even Zen-Yogi doesn't help. I'm a seething volcano inside. All you're doing is changing a few of Morticia's words, just enough so the publisher will turn it down, and you've got your wife back. But at what price? How can a man of honor tamper with her beautiful lines? Who needs a man of honor? You do it. Well, better to preserve a marriage than a masterpiece. I'll dictate the changes, you write them down. Okay, take it from the top. "Out of the sweet-scented swamp, Lucifer, the kindly wolf, minced dandily. " All right, change that to "Across a daisy-covered meadow, "the snarling, sniveling, slathering wolf slunk. " That's great. - But isn't that "slank"? - No, I think it's "slinked. " - How about "slunk"? - Very well, make it "slunk. " - I can't go on. - You've got to. You convinced me. Ah, thank you, Thing. I don't know what I would have done without you. - I better sharpen this quill. - All right. Boy, they're not making quills like they used to. I feel so guilty, being away from my writing. You've got to relax. If Keats had had a ping-pong table he'd have lived longer. How can I relax? It's been three days and no word from my publisher. Don't worry, the rejection slip ought to be here any minute. Rejection slip? Gomez, what does he mean? Querida, we must be realistic. Genius often goes unrecognized. After all, Dostoyevsky wasn't discovered until he was 56. No wonder. With a name like that, the reviewers probably couldn't even spell it. Whose point was that, Fester? - Who could that be? - Oh, wouldn't it be lovely if it was my publisher, telling me he was going to print my book? You writers, you live in a dream world. Mr. Boswell, publisher. For a minute there, I thought you said Mr. Boswell? Publisher? Morticia Addams. Let me look at you. - Incredible. - How do you do? Look, Boswell, if you're here with a rejection slip, be quick about it and on your way. Rejection slip? Really, my dear fellow! Why, this little lady is a genius. And I'm here to publish her work. What do you have to say to that, Mrs. Addams? Thank you. Now, as to the finances, at present we're a little tight with working capital. However, if you could see fit to put up, let's say, $5,000, I'll publish your book, and we'll make a fortune. That sounds intriguing. Just as I thought, a bunko artist, out for the money. - I'll shoot him in the back. - I've got a better idea. - In the front? - Boswell. I've decided to accept your offer, but we'll make it $10,000 - and use a higher-grade paper. - You better let me shoot him in the back. - It's much cheaper. - No. - 10,000. - This is most generous of you. Without my husband's help, none of this would be possible. You can say that again. - I've got to get the presses rolling. - I'll see you out. I suppose you'll want some snapshots and some biographical notes? Just the snapshots. Let's forget the biographical notes. - You gave that faker 10,000 bucks? - And with good reason. With that much, the scoundrel will skip to Brazil - and that'll be the end of it. - And to think, some people call you a nut. No wonder! Please, I'm too upset! In-laws. Lunch. Oh, Lurch. Just in time. Yes, midnight. - Did Mr. Addams go to bed? - Sound asleep. Tish, you spoke French! Darling, now, now, now. You repose while I compose, dear. Lurch, a very interesting technical question has arisen. And both Thing and Cousin Cackle seemed a little vague about it. Yes? What was the name of that mean little girl, who was so beastly to those three lovely bears? Goldilocks. Ah, yes. Goldilocks. Trust a blonde to bring on trouble. Well, when I get through with Miss Goldilocks, her books will be banned from coast to coast. Oh, Lurch, Mr. Addams didn't quite make it. Would you tuck him in, please? Yes, Mrs. Addams. Hey, Gomez, grab your motorcycle. I'll race you to the attic. Fester, my wife's been in that cave for three weeks and you want me to go hill-climbing? - Can you think of anything better to do? - My poor querida. Slaving away on book eight, for what? For some phony publisher living it up in Rio. I got a hunch he didn't go to Rio. I think he went to Europe. - What difference does it make? - Well, it costs a lot less in Europe. - He might bring you back some change. - I don't care about the money. - I must tell Morticia the truth. - About Boswell? About my tampering with her book. Well, I'm certainly glad that I didn't have anything to do with that. Well, here it is, Gomez, darling. Book number eight. And not a word from Mr. Boswell about book number one. Tish, are books all you can think about? For a dedicated authoress, dear, what else is there? - There's me. - Oh, you're right. - My next book will be about you. - Morticia, there's something I must tell you. - You'll never hear from Mr. Boswell again. - Oh? - Hey, who do you think's coming in? - Cousin Turncoat? No, Mr. Boswell. Come in, come in. Folks, this is a great day for American literature. You're going back to Brazil? No, dear, I believe Mr. Boswell means he brought us some good news? - Did you bring us some change? - Some change indeed. $2,000 worth, as an advance to Mrs. Addams. And there'll be many thousands more, when the book hits the bestseller lists. - You mean you printed it? - In genuine pebbled calfskin. Egad! The man's more cunning than I thought. He's after more money. Gomez, just think, my work on the same shelves with - Plato, Shakespeare and Aristophanes. - Even Mickey Spillane. The advance sale has been tremendous. Schools are ordering books like hotcakes. You're sure you don't mean ordering hotcakes like books? Mrs. Addams, here is a contract for your next 10 books. Read it, sign it, get it back to me, and we're in business. - Thank you. - Well, toodle-oo. I never figured him for a toodle-ooer. Gomez, what perfidy is this? Is something wrong, my dear? Wrong? Listen to this title. A Treasury of Mean Witches, Evil Giants and Wicked Goblins, - and Other Bedtime Stories. - The censors'll never pass that. And listen to this! "Across the daisy-covered meadow, "the snarling, sniveling, slavering wolf slunk. " - "Slinked"? - I felt that it should have been "slank. " Slinked, slanked or slunked! That treacherous Mr. Boswell and his hired assassins have ruined my work. - The cad! - I'll shoot him in the back. - No, Fester, we can't go that far. - One bullet each? No, there will be no shooting. I have the soul of an artist, and I will not sell it for mere money. - Querida! You've given up writing. - For the time being. - The world isn't ready for good literature. - How true. The world isn't ready for you. But I'm more than ready. Tish Next time you write a book, write it in French. - Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. - Children. - Hello, darlings. - Look at these books they gave us to read in school. A Treasury of Mean Witches, Evil Giants, Wicked Goblins and Other Bedtime Stories by Morticia Addams. Mother, how could you? Children, please, watch your language. Besides, your mother didn't write those, I did. Gomez, you? Children, please go play with your spiders. Cara, much as it hurt to rewrite those glorious phrases of yours, I had to do it. - And I know why. - You do? You wanted to prove that the only thing that publishers will print today is junk. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. - It must be for me. - It is for you, Uncle Fester. - It's from my publisher. - Publisher? Yeah, I wrote a book. Forever Fester. And this fellow accepted it. And I only had to give him $5,000. And he didn't run off to Brazil or Europe, either. He skipped to Australia. 
Here, darling. Cleopatra, don't gulp. Morticia. - Did you see the paper this morning? - No, dear. The bottom fell out of the stock market again. They really ought to fix that rickety old place. The bottom's always falling out of it. Oh, it's not the place, it's the stock. And you know, Gomez could lose millions in a good market but, boy, I bet he lost his shirt today. He has plenty of shirts. It's his money I'm worried about. Come now, Blooker, you've been my broker long enough to know that a little market crash doesn't scare me. Why, my Consolidated Funds climbed to 60 yesterday. Unfortunately I'd sold it the day before. Blooker, I just feel like buying a railroad. A little surprise for my wife. We'd better find Gomez and see if everything is all right. Thing? Would you finish feeding Cleopatra, please, Thing? That's good. Now mind your manners, dear. Blooker, I know fortunes have been lost speculating on railroads, but what's a fortune? But Mr. Addams, the people I'm talking about went broke. Broke? They're absolutely penniless. Wiped out. That's incredible, Blooker, incredible. Broke, you say? Penniless? Wiped out? Ghastly, absolutely ghastly. - Uncle Fester, this is shocking. - It's worse than I thought. Oh, the poor, poor dear. Poor thing is right. They wiped him out like a greasy skillet. It's hard to believe, Blooker. As a token of my sympathy, write them a check for $100,000. And now get moving on that railroad. Oh, dear. Oh, thank you, Thing. And thank you, Cleopatra. It's so nice to know you have friends at a time like this. Morticia, what are we gonna do for money? I'm too proud to beg and too lazy to work. Never mind, Uncle Fester, I'll think of something. It's Gomez I'm concerned about. The poor dear. He must never know that we know. It'd kill him. If his life insurance is paid up, that could be a solution. - Uncle Fester. - Hello, Fester! - There you are, my dear. - Darling. I'm gonna be busy all day. If you want me for anything, I'll be in the library on my private line to my broker. - Pawnbroker? I know a fellow that'II - No, no. Stockbroker. Naturally, Uncle Fester. I'm buying up a little stock. Nothing big. Just a few million here or there. You know, a little pastime. Oh, that poor, brave, darling man. Did you see him? Laughing in the face of disaster. - It almost made me cry. - Almost? It does make me cry. Buck up, Uncle Fester. I'll call the family together. We'll handle this. Spend another million. Just keep buying. Now, how much stock do I have so far? - 100,000 shares so far. - Fine. Now, how much do I need to control the company? About 200,000. But, Mr. Addams, what do you want with a broken-down railroad like Big Swamp and Southern? You'll never make any money with it. Make money? I've got money. What I'm looking for is excitement, adventure. Adventure? Now, frankly, Blooker, I'm getting a bit bored with my model trains. I'm just itching to get my hands on a real railroad. Think what a wreck I could have with those babies. Wreck? What else? Oh, we'd keep the people off. All right, now, Blooker. Get moving. And, oh, Blooker? Keep my name out of this. I don't want Wall Street to know what I'm doing. Now, we must think of ways to make money. I know an easy way. - Oh? - Print it! - Uncle Fester, that's illegal. - It is? - I can get a job as a bunny girl. - No. No, I don't like the hours. Besides, that atmosphere. You're much too sweet and innocent. How about a beauty expert? - Beauty expert? - Yeah, you know, a hairstylist. That's perfect, Mama. Now, remember, we must keep this from Gomez. Just tell him it's a lark. Wednesday and I are gonna pitch in, too. We're gonna open a drink stand on the sidewalk. Marvelous. What are you gonna do, Mother? I think I'll give fencing instruction and tango lessons. I'm gonna start an escort service. Me and Lurch. You know, hire out for dates, like with rich widows, eh, Lurch? I'm sure you'll be an instant success. You're both such fascinating types. Look, Mother! Thing wants to help, too. How sweet. Thank you, Thing. I feel so good being my own boss, I think I'll take the rest of the day off. Oh, it's almost perfect. But do you think it could stand a little dash of hemlock juice? That's it. I knew it needed something. Oh, what a lovely sign. We're gonna paste a picture on it, too. Oh, that's a marvelous attention-getter. You children are going to be fine little merchants. - Uncle Fester, what are you doing? - I'm practicing for my escort service. You see, I figure I'll have all different kinds of women for customers, so I gotta be all different kinds of men for them. - Oh? - Well, you know, if they like Cary Grant, I'll be Cary Grant. Hello, duck, what are you doing today? And if they like their Frank Sinatra, why, I'll be Frank Sinatra. Uncle Fester, I think that's a mistake. Yeah, I think I better get another song. No, no. What woman could possibly ask for more than Uncle Fester himself? Yeah. Well, you got me there. Well, well, what's going on? I haven't seen so much activity since the night I hid the hornets in Aunt Phobia's sleeping bag. Darling, this is something I'm doing for the children. I think every child should know the value of money. By george, you're right. Attention, children. Five pennies make a nickel, two nickels make a dime, - Yes, Father. - Yes, Father. Good. Now you know the value of money. We're running a little low on cigars. You rang? Lurch, you better pick me up another 1,000 cigars. The dollar size. Thank you. Well, back to the stock market. Have fun, everyone! Oh, that sweet, darling man. He's trying so hard not to let us know. $1,000 worth of cigars. I'm not sure we can afford him. Oh, look, Gladys, this must be one of those gigolo places. $50 an hour? Oh, they must be absolutely dreamy. See for yourselves, girls. - What's the matter with them? - Flighty. - Well, how's business, kids? - Pretty slow, sir. Gee, with a cute sign like that, you should be doing great. "Henbane on the rocks. " Boy, those trade names get wackier everyday. - Let me have a tall one, son. - Yes, sir. Well, always like to help out the small businessman. - Cheers! - Cheers. - Would you like some more? - I'd like some help. I'm gonna tell my lawyer about this. See? Satisfied customers always tell their friends. Oh, my Why, I've tasted better glue than this. Maybe we ought to sell glue on the rocks. I bet Mother's making lots of money, though. En garde. And parry, thrust. Parry, thrust. How're you doing, Morticia? Are you teaching him anything? Oh, Mama, I'm so disappointed. I haven't had a pupil all day long. Well, I'm pretty disgusted, too. I went to every beauty shop in town. Nothing. I'm very surprised. Your talent is so obvious. Honey, it isn't what you know, it's who you know. That's true. Good man, Blooker, keep spending. My dear family, I'm afraid we didn't make very much today, but Thing sold a pencil. Thank you, dear Thing. Just a nickel? We made a quarter. Oh, that's wonderful, dear. But the man's going to sue us. - Oh? - Morticia? I guess I was high man for the day. I made a dollar. Oh, Uncle Fester, that's wonderful. Your escort service must be catching on. Well, not exactly. A lady gave it to me when I popped up from behind my sign. - Said it cured her hiccups. - Oh. Nothing like a fiery tango right after breakfast to stir up the old hormones. Yes, it is exhilarating. - Well, mind if I cut in? - Please do. This reminds me of the junior prom. My date looked just like Gomez. - Well, can't dance the day away. - Oh, you got a job? - Fester, don't be cruel. - Sorry, slip of the tongue. Darling, you do have some financial plans, don't you? Nothing important, mind you. Just a little amusement. Gomez, do you have something to tell me? After all, I am your wife. No need to remind me of that, cara mia. Morticia thought you'd like to talk about money. Money? Why should I bother her pretty head with a thing like that? You're not well, Fester. - Mail's in. - I'll get it, my dear. Thank you, Thing. Oh, the circular I sent for from the yacht company. Thought I'd buy a yacht and take us all on a world cruise. - A cruise? - At a time like this? I think we could use a change of scenery. The Dead Sea, perhaps. Some fun place. That settles it. I'm going to sell everything we own. I must get money for Gomez. You mean auction him off, huh? - Oh, you mean get money to give Gomez? - Yes, dear. Now, you come upstairs with me and help me get out the family jewels and treasures. Are you ready? Ready. Uncle Fester, I do think we ought to have gotten the combination from Gomez. Oh, it wasn't locked. I just like to keep in practice on my safe-blowing. You do have a delicate touch. Oh, dear, I dread to think of selling our family heirlooms and treasures. Cousin Crimp's glass eye. Those were the days when men were men. Uncle Fester, look. Pugsley's baby spoon. He always did have a strong bite. And not a bad bark, either. What's that? Oh, I'd forgotten all about that. It was a gift for my 12th birthday from Grandpa Droop. Stock certificates. "100 shares, Big Swamp and Southern Railway. " I read something about that in the paper today. What did I do with today's paper? Yeah, sure, there it is. "Wall Street is intrigued by a mystery financier "who is buying stock in the Big Swamp and Southern Railway. " Uncle Fester, do you think maybe he'd buy this? Why don't we call a broker and find out? What's the name of that outfit that Gomez deals with? - Blaker, Blacker, Blooker - Blooker and Company. Oh, but I don't want to embarrass Gomez by telling some stranger that we need money. Well, why don't you give him a phony name? Phony name. Jones? What kind of a name is that? - Smith? - Much better. What do you mean you can't find any more stock, Blooker? I need only another 100 shares to control the whole railroad. Mr. Addams, there isn't a single share for sale. I've got men looking all over the country. - Well, have them look in the city, too. - Just a minute. Hello? Who? Mrs. Smith? What? We certainly are interested in buying your stock. I can pay you $10,000? Well, that's awfully nice of you. - He's offering $10,000. - Then ask for $20,000. I'd like $20,000. - He'll pay $20,000. - Good, make it $30,000. I'm sorry, but - $30,000? - Crook! Hello? Uncle Fester! That always makes them a little more anxious. Mrs. Smith? Mrs. Smith? Oh, no. - Yes, Blooker. - I found the 100 shares of stock for you. Good man, I knew you'd do it! - But I lost it again. - Lost it? That's mighty careless, Blooker. Put an ad in the lost and found. - Uncle Fester, I'm worried. - Big business. Better play it cool. - But hanging up on him. - Yeah, maybe that was a little too cool. - I think I'd better ask Gomez's advice. - Oh, you can't tell him what we're doing. Uncle Fester, you're not the only one in this family who can be cool. But, Blooker, what if she doesn't call you back, what then? No problem, I'll kill myself. Good thinking. Blooker, if you do get that stock for me, I'll buy you the biggest, thickest, juiciest camel-hump steak in town. What do you have to say to that? I'll kill myself. Got a one-track mind, Blooker. I like that. Oh, Tish! Even when I speak French, it drives me wild. Darling, I want to ask your advice. You know, I'm trying to teach Pugsley a little bit about business. Oh, a chip off the old block, that lad. Well, he's decided to sell his flea collection and a boy at school has offered him 30 $30 for it. Well, there's a simple rule, my dear. Never accept the first nine offers. When they come up with number 10, grab it. Take the 10th offer. It's known as Addams' Law. Or "How to slit your competitor's throat without getting blood on his necktie. " What a colorful phrase. It isn't for nothing they call me The Plunger. - The men on Wall Street? - The men in the plumbers' union. But, Mr. Addams, I've got my secretary calling every Smith in the book. Just a minute. Hello? Mrs. Smith. It's Mrs. Smith, she called back. Good, don't let her get away. Offer her $50,000. Right. Mrs. Smith, I can offer you $50,000. $50,000? Buzzardfeed. I'm sorry, I'm afraid that's only your fourth offer. Please continue. She wants more! Make it $60,000. How about $60,000? - Well - $70,000! Who is that? - Well - I'm another customer, that's who is that. I wanna buy her stock myself, I'll go $80,000! She's got another buyer. Great shades of Hades, run him out! Bid his head off! How about $100,000? Isn't that sweet? Thing wants to get in on the bidding, too. $200,000? I'm sorry, Mr. Blooker, I have a third bidder at $200,000. Wait a minute. Now, look, I wanted to bid $300,000. $350,000! $400,000, Mr. Blooker. $500,000? $500,000. $600,000! Let's see you top that, nimble knuckles! He can't go any higher. That's all the fingers he's got. Oh, poor Thing. Hell, I've gotta have that railroad, Blooker. I just wrecked my last locomotive. Just a minute, Blooker. What is it, Thing? You think I can get the railroad for that? Thank you, Thing. I'll make one more offer, Blooker, $1 million. I'll try. Mrs. Smith? Mrs. Smith? This is my last and final offer. $1 million. It's his 10th offer. - How much? - What difference does it make? Sold, for $1 million. I can hardly wait to get my hands on that railroad. Nice going, Blooker. To show you my appreciation, I'm gonna send you a couple of freight cars. Gomez, darling, guess what I made today? - That fabulous bat broth of yours? - No, $1 million. Oh. Well, I have some real news for you. I just bought a railroad. Oh, darling, that's wonderful, but - A railroad? - Big Swamp and Southern. When I blow those tracks, it'll be the wreck of the century. He bought a railroad. The Big Swamp He bought it. Addams here. Hello, Blooker. You heard what? The Big Swamp and Southern sank into the big swamp? Clear out of sight, eh? Thanks for calling me. Oh, well, easy come, easy go. Oh, I do hope this shawl isn't too short for Cousin Crimp. It looks perfect. - And so does this. - What's that, dear? I bought your stock, querida, I intend to pay for it. Oh, nonsense. Even though you're still wealthy, I refuse to accept it. It's a matter of honor, querida. There you are, a check for $1 million. First National Bank of Siberia? Nice bunch. Always pay in cold cash. Are you sure? Come to think of it, we Addamses haven't done any business with them since 1917. Things may have changed since then. Forget that check, I'll write another. Second National Bank of Peking. How could I have ever doubted your financial genius? Querida, we all make mistakes. Darling, let's celebrate. Wine, Thing. Thank you, Thing. How convenient. Instant wine. - Cara. - Darling. 
Hey, Thing, how about snapping it up a bit? You know, not all of us are Mozart fans. Darn it! I was just getting started. Uncle Fester, please. I do not like profanity. I'll get it, Lurch. - Are you ready for the big finish, querida? - Yes, darling. I hate to disturb you, but you've got company. Darling, we have company. We'll have to finish this later, querida. I was just passing by and I was transported by your lovely music. How sweet! It's so nice to have a true music lover in our home. Gomez Addams here. This is my wife, Morticia. How do you do? And this is the genius himself, Lurch. I haven't heard such music since my mother passed on. Oh, your mother played the harpsichord? No, they played it at her funeral. How nice. Since then, whenever I hear it, I get a flutter right here. - You need a little bicarb. - Fester. Oh, my card. "Oscar Belmont, Curator of the Fine Arts Museum. " It's an honor to have a man like you in our simple home. Oh, I I wouldn't exactly call it simple. You seem to have some remarkable museum pieces of your own. - Do you really think so? - Yes, indeed. This harpsichord, for example. Most unusual. It's a genuine 1503 Krupnik. It was in Cousin Crimp's family for over 400 years. Cousin Crimp used to love playing it. Played four-handed pieces on it all by himself. Beautiful. It should be on exhibit to inspire all humanity. - You mean in your museum? - Yes. But unfortunately we couldn't afford - Say no more. It's yours. - But Please. Please accept it as the Addams' contribution to posterity. We'll send the truck for it this afternoon. No. It may take a little time to prepare Lurch for the shock. - Oh, yes, of course. - Yes. - Well, then, Friday? - Friday. Exquisite. - He is a music lover, isn't he? - Reminds me of Aunt Trivia. Was Aunt Trivia a music lover? No. She just liked to go around kissing harpsichords. - Well, on to Lurch. - Oh, yes. So you see, Lurch, inasmuch as you love the harpsichord so, the real public benefactors wouldn't be us. It would be you. We'd even instruct the museum, Lurch, to name you as donor. What do you say to that? I quit. Lurch, Lurch, you can't quit. You're like one of the family. Think of all those glorious, happy years we've spent together. Think of the children. Think of Mama and Uncle Fester. I quit. Take away my Krupnik. Lurch, we only meant to do what was right. You do forgive us, don't you? Well, then, Lurch, smile to show us that there are no hard feelings. Come, come, Lurch. Smile. That's better. Now turn the end around this way. That's it. That's it. - There you have it. - All right, you can let it down now. Thank you, Lurch. You've been very understanding. I still don't see why we had to lug this thing all the way down here. Uncle Fester, dear, I told you. We have to acclimatize it. It has to be damp enough to stand the dry air in that sunny museum. Got you. Here's the water. Where do you want it? No, no, no, Uncle Fester. Not that way. Put it back. Put it back. This way. Now, there's some for you, and there's some for you, and some for you. - May May I, Mrs. Addams? - Why, of course, Lurch. I can't. I can't. Oh, Gomez, I think we wounded him beyond repair. Cara mia, it's your imagination. - What's that? - My imagination. - What's he doing? - He's flipped. Uncle Fester, I do not like profanity. But I'm afraid you're right. We've left Lurch in the lurch. We must find some way to fill this void in his life. I could give him Yvette's address. Who's Yvette? My French pen pal. With the Folies Bergere. Lurch needs more than a pen pal. Okay. Send her the fare and she'll come over in person. I think Lurch needs a new cultural interest. Yes. Well, if you ever have a problem with me, send for Yvette. Now you're all set, Lurch. Hit it! An absolute inspiration, Morticia. Suits him perfectly. Come on, Lurch. Give it the old razzmatazz. Let yourself go, Lurch. Just pretend you're in the jungle again, and they're beginning to start the ancient fertility dance. You can pretend that, can't you, Lurch? I'll try. I want my harpsichord. Well, drums didn't go over with much of a bang. I guess Lurch is just a hopeless longhair. I don't understand it. Now then, Lurch, needles go here, and around with the yarn. Through. Now you try. No, Lurch, no. One piece at a time. One piece of yarn. That's it. And slip it off. There. Isn't that fun? Doesn't it take your mind off of your troubles? I thought so. Now, what would you like to knit first? A harpsichord. I suppose the only thing that will make Lurch happy is his harpsichord. That's no problem. We'll build him one. Capital idea! But, darling, that would take absolute acoustical perfection, the very essence of mechanical precision, and delicate artistry and woodcarving. Do you think you can do it? I don't know. I never tried. Well, let's see now. We have the wood, we have the wire, we've got the foot pedals, and 300 felt pads. Darling, why so many felt pads? Well, if this harpsichord turns out well, we might decide to build a spare. I do hope Lurch doesn't find out what you're doing down here. You will work quietly, won't you? Don't worry, Morticia. I soundproofed the saw, see? No teeth. Oh. - But will it work? - Sure. Watch. Well, fellow craftsmen, everyone to work. - Please do hurry. - Oh, yeah. We'll do the job. After all, how long can it take to build a harpsichord? Two days? We'd better be on the safe side. Make it three. Whatever you do, don't let Lurch down here. If he found out what we were doing, he'd be beside himself. That would make an interesting picture. Busy, busy, busy. We will now proceed to build a harpsichord. - All right. First I'll measure the old one. - Good thinking, Fester. Here we go. Are you ready? - All right. It's 36. - 36. - You got that? - Yeah. - 21. - 21. And 36. - 36. - Yeah. By george, those are Morticia's measurements exactly. This is going to be fun. - Please, it's gonna Take - Come over here, will you? - Take what? - Here. You know, Gomez, these harpsichords are hard to build. Thirty-six hours away from you has turned me into a raving maniac. Well, rave later, dear. Right now, finish that harpsichord. - It's almost done. - Oh, wonderful. I couldn't keep Lurch away from that playroom another moment. Just send him on an errand. When he comes back, voilá! The imitation Krupnik will be in place and he'll not be the wiser. Wonderful. - Darling, whatever is that for? - For the strings. Oh, yes. They do require delicate tuning. Oh, do hurry. Lurch will be here any minute. There. What do you think? I think it looks just like the old one. Even down to those lovely wormholes. That's a simple matter. Just an ice pick and a few sharp taps. We forgot the most important thing. There! A genuine imitation Krupnik. Oh, it'll be so nice to see Lurch's old smiling self again. Surprise! We changed our minds, Lurch. We told Mr. Belmont we simply could not part with the harpsichord. He'll just have to get his own Krupnik. And that's not going to be easy. These things aren't built in a day. Takes three. - It's all yours, Lurch. - Forever and ever. I think we ought to leave Lurch alone with his harpsichord for the rest of the day. Excellent idea, cara mia. - We'll spend the afternoon at Lovers' Leap. - What'll I do there? We'll make love and you'll leap. - Darling, what about the museum people? - They'll be along tomorrow. Excellent, that's Lurch's day off. What marvelous planning. We should be in Washington. Come in. Excuse me. - You wanted something? - No. I mean, yes. Just the harpsichord. We were supposed to pick it up tomorrow. But as long as we were in the neighborhood We thought we'd get it today. But we can come back tomorrow. Yeah, we can send somebody else tomorrow. You want my harpsichord? No, we don't want it. - Mr. Belmont wants it. - For the museum. But it's mine! Sure, sure. But we have a pickup order. - Betrayed. - Not by us. Look, maybe we're in the wrong place altogether. - Yeah, the wrong place. - Stop. Take it. - Really? - Take it! Certainly. By george, it's good to get out. Yes, it always make you appreciate what you have in your own home. Hey, do you see what I don't see? - The harpsichord! It's gone! - It can't be! It's gone all right. - Lurch, where are you going? - What's that in your hand? - Where are you going? - Answer the third question first. - Yes, where are you going? - Home to Mama. Nonsense! Easy, Lurch. You'll lose your pension rights. Nobody cares about me. - Of course we care about you, Lurch. - We all love you. Now, let's not get sickening. I like you, Lurch, but I don't love you. Besides, Lurch, you have to give us two weeks' notice. And think, Lurch, where will you ever find another home like this? You could wind up butling luncheons at the Optimist Club. Think how that would crush your spirit. - I'm going. - All right. But I have to warn you, I'm an attorney. I can hit you with a restraining order. - Gomez, you can't do that. - I can't? How about habeas corpus? Nonsense, darling. I think we can settle this out of court. That's right, Lurch. Just go upstairs, unpack your suitcase and put away your undies. We'll take care of everything. - Those big fellows sure come unglued fast. - Poor man. His whole world crumbled when he lost his harpsichord. Morticia, could the museum have come here and taken the wrong instrument on the wrong day? It's a possibility. Why don't we call them? See if they'll send it back? Good thinking. Gomez, darling, it's wonderful the way you just leap in and take charge. Lead the way. That's what they said about old Commodore Addams. - Oh? When he led his men into battle? - Off his sinking ship. Hello, Fine Arts Museum? This is Mrs. Addams. I'd like to report a ghastly error. I believe some of your men came over this afternoon and removed the wrong harpsichord. You don't say. You don't say! - What do they say? - You heard her. They don't say. That's unbelievable. Well, I don't blame you. I think you did exactly the right thing. Goodbye. - You won't believe it. - I'll believe it. You know that nice Mr. Belmont? Well, he isn't nice at all. He isn't even with the museum. He's a notorious crook. - A crook? - Yes. He tried to sell your homemade harpsichord to the museum - for $15,000. - What happened? Well, of course they took one look at it and had him arrested. Well, it wasn't that bad. Well, of course not, Uncle Fester, but after all, a Krupnik is a Krupnik. Is a Krupnik. It's fate. Our beloved harpsichord is destined to remain in this house. It's good to have the old Krupnik back again, isn't it? Uncle Fester, what are you making now? I'm making a petit point saddlebag for Mama's broom. How nice. That old harpsichord sounds magnificent, doesn't it? Yes, darling. Whatever happened to the one you built? Left it at The Midnight Mission. You'd be surprised how many music lovers they have down there. - And what about Mr. Belmont? - His trial comes up in three weeks. - He'll get ten years. - Why, querida? I'm defending him. - I'm glad. - You're glad? Yes, he ought to get life, and with you defending him, he will. 
It's all very simple, children. All you need is 20/20 vision, nerves of steel, and absolutely perfect coordination. Like this. You also need an indomitable spirit. That's the safe way to make a basket. Once more. - Oh, that was a nice toss, darling. - Thank you. Thank you, Lurch. Querida! Perfect. Exactly the way I taught you. And that's the way I want you to do it, too. Children, we'll have another lesson tomorrow. - You're a good teacher. - Thank you, Father. Cara mia, stop right there. Oh, but darling, I must take this plant down to the playroom. I don't see a plant. I see a rare flower. You. - My lovely black orchid. - Oh, Gomez, darling. Your Castilian blood courses through your veins so gloriously. Oh, that's terrible. Morticia doesn't seem to think so. No, I'm talking about this article. "The Danger of a Happy Marriage" by Dr. Francois Chalon, the eminent psychologist. - Danger? In a happy marriage? - You bet. This fellow says that, "Married couples who seem ideally mated "and perfectly attuned are really miserable, emotional messes underneath. " Well, the poor things. Not everyone can be as fortunate as we, cara mia. Music, Lurch, to underscore this magic moment. You just oughtta read this. This Dr. Chalon is tops in his profession. He says that couples who fight like cats and dogs are really the happy ones. - Happy, cara mia? - Ecstatic, cavaliere mio. You are sick, sick, sick. Darling, I'm worried. Do you think there could be anything wrong with our marriage? I couldn't be happier. Querida, if our marriage is shaky, I want to keep it shaking for all eternity. Your knight in shining armor will defend it against the world. Oh, darling, something I've always wanted. An indoor waterfall. - You're so ingenious. - That's true. Well, off to the Zen-Yogi society. We're doing our latest position, the spread eagle. - On the floor? - Midair. Have fun. I forgot my glasses. - Who did that? - Gomez. - Deliberately? - We were talking about our marriage and suddenly he picked up the spear and flung it. You had a fight. Congratulations. Nonsense, Uncle Fester. We've never been happier. - You poor, misguided soul. - But Please, you'll make me cry. Come on, Lurch. Tighter. I just gotta get rid of this headache of mine. Oh, forget it. I'll never get rid of this headache. You always said that thing was perfect for soothing your nerves. How can I have soothed nerves when tragedy is about to strike - someone very near and dear to us? - The octopus? The moose? Morticia and Gomez. Gomez is beginning to crack already. For no reason at all, he just practically wrecked the plumbing. They're gonna really erupt one of these days and All over! We gotta get them to fight, so they'll let off a little emotional steam. - Then they'll kiss and make up, huh? - Right. You know, like a well-adjusted couple. Now, all in favor of making Morticia and Gomez miserable for their own good, raise their hands. It's unanimous. - Please, not while I'm coughing. - Sorry, Fester. Morticia, my pet, did you make a slight rearrangement of the chessmen? She probably knew she was beaten. Darling, are you accusing me of fudging? It's just an excuse. He's trapped and he knows it. Forgive me, angelito mío. There, my king stalemates your king. It's a draw. Neither one of us wins. Of course, darling, it had to be. We're so perfectly matched. We've just got to do what the professor says. Get them brawling. Hello? Gomez Addams? Who's calling? Grand guru? You must be the president of Gomez's Zen-Yogi society. His dues? Yeah, I'll tell him what he There aren't gonna be any dues, not this month's or any month's from now on. Mrs. Addams talked her husband into quitting your phony society. She says Zen-Yogi is a fake. Yeah, she put him wise to you quacks! Gomez will have a fit. He loves Zen-Yogi. Exactly. And if he doesn't give Morticia a whack or two, how else is going to prove his undying love? And if she cares for him she'll conk him once or twice. What lovely fireworks. They'll light up the whole sky with "I love you. " An ace. My weekly game at the Zen-Yogi clubhouse is something I look forward to with a passion. Imagine playing seven card lowball on your head. I am Drashi Dumo, grand guru of the local Zen-Yogi society. Follow me. - The grand guru. - Grand guru! This is a surprise. Mr. Addams, I am the one who is surprised. In fact, I am deeply shocked. Zen-Yogi is not a fraud. It is nirvana. It is the ultimate. Well, of course it's the ultimate. I might even say it goes beyond the ultimate. Who would dare say it's a fraud? Your wife, Mrs. Addams. Yeah, your wife, Mrs. Addams. She did? Well, she's a very intelligent woman. If her intuition tells her it's a fraud, then it must be a fraud. Then you are quitting the society? Morticia said that? My darling querida. Just trying to save me the embarrassment of telling you myself. You're not gonna let her dictate to you, are you, Gomez? You love Zen-Yogi. After what has been said about Zen-Yogi in this house, we will never accept you again. Good day. Wait! Tell him his wife's a meddler. Let's get a little battle going here. Darling, did I hear a strange voice? Tish, Zen-Yogi's been taking up entirely too much of my life. Darling, you're so right. And besides, all this standing on your head is getting rather expensive. - None of your hats fit anymore. - It's more fun doing things together. Darling, could this be the time we should take our safari up the Amazon? Wonderful. A second honeymoon. - Darling. - Cara. Did you hear that? I'm gonna have to take the most drastic step of all. Now! Today. You're right. We just can't let them go off alone. Suppose they explode up the Amazon. - Only one would come back alive. - Which one? I don't know. And that's the worst part of it. I just couldn't stand the suspense. A gentleman to see you, Doctor. I hope I can help you. I read your article in a magazine. Yes, a marriage problem. Have you ever considered wearing a toupee? Oh, it's not me, it's my niece and nephew. They seem ideally mated. Completely happy. A potentially disastrous relationship. I had five marriages of my own. Each one ideal, and then Five marriages? You must really understand women. Naturally. I've killed three men for women. - Duels. - Well, that's a nice pastime. But you've just got to meet Morticia and Gomez. As a friend of mine. Not as a doctor. So you can study and observe them, without letting them know. You've just got to help them. - Well, I'm afraid I'm a very busy man. - Oh, please, please. We can't let a beautiful woman like Morticia go through life as a Ionely divorcée. Beautiful? Well Never let it be said that Francois Chalon ever refused a lady in distress. Oh, goody. You're a school chum of dear Uncle Fester's? - Yeah, that was correspondence school. - How charming. Oh, that French! Even when he speaks it. The French are so suave. But the Castilian is much more exciting in his ardor. Will you come and meet our Mama? Mama, this is Dr. Chalon. - Charmed. - That's a most unusual ball of yarn - you're working with. - Oh, it's a shrunken head. I'm taking the hair off. I'm going to crochet a nice tea cozy with it. And this is my daughter, Wednesday. Oh, what a pity! Your little doll lost its head. She hasn't lost it. She's Marie Antoinette. And I chopped it off. Would you care for a cocktail before dinner, Dr. Chalon? Yes, I think I could use one. You rang? Cocktails, Lurch. Use the good hemlock. - Shall we adjourn to the library? - Yes. So much more intime. - Please, that's French. - Darling, please. We have a guest. Oh, yes, forgive me. Shall we? I asked him here to solve a problem. Now he's creating one. That's just what we want. We'll encourage it. This is my darling Cleopatra. Genus African strangler. If I may say so, I find you fascinating, completely irresistible. I believe you're trying to tell me something. From the first moment I saw you, I was enchanted. Dr. Chalon! I believe Uncle Fester's school chums are always welcome here, but I think you're abusing our hospitality. I happen to be married. If you don't mind my saying so, I've made women forget their husbands in one day. - Please, I love Gomez. - Who's Gomez? - My husband. - You see, I've forgotten him already. You'll recognize him when you see him again. Fester, are you trying to accuse Morticia of flirting with Chalon? All I can say is I'm sorry I ever invited him over. Then I'll have to defend my honor, like a true Addams. Well, spoken like a true Castilian nobleman. - Let her have it. - Mr. Addams. - Your charming wife just - Sir, you have trifled with the sanctity of my marriage. I demand satisfaction. My card. "Validated one-hour parking at Joe's. " Slight error. Now, you may choose your weapons. These rapiers. In one hour. This is all wrong. You were supposed to sock Morticia. My rapier shall speak for me. Please turn the other cheek. I only have two. Gomez. He's the best swordsman in all France. He is? For Morticia, my querida, I would fight the greatest swordsman in the world. Oh, shucks. Sorry, sir. Poor Gomez. If only he'd belted you once, everything would have been perfect. That's no way for a man to treat the woman he loves. That Chalon will slice him like a nickel baloney. Oh, dear. I must stop it. But how? He'll enjoy killing Gomez. But Gomez won't enjoy it. I had the most horrible dream. I dreamed that you killed Chalon and the police came and took you away. And Gomez, you're my favorite nephew. I just couldn't bear it. Please, you gotta call off that duel. Don't be absurd. If the police come I'll face them. With shoulders back, head high, and say, "It was an accident. " Gee, Gomez, you know, with that sword in your hand - it's a thing of beauty. - It's all in the wrists. In the wrist, huh? Please can I try it? - Go ahead. - Thank you. Oh, dear. And we don't have another. Now you'll have to call the duel off. Nonsense. This is much better. - Gomez, you said it was all in your wrist? - Oh, yes. Here, we got to keep it in shape. Let me give it a little massage. - Here, how's that feel? - It's all right. Yeah? Better? Well, yes, much better. - But not for dueling. - You mean you'll have to call it off? Not while I still have this hand. By george, I just realized it. I'm left-handed. Cousin Itt, I'm faced with a terrible problem, and I know you have a good head on your shoulders You do have shoulders, don't you? Three? Well. Anyway, Gomez and a certain Dr. Chalon have become involved in a deadly duel over me. There is a simple solution? What? A duel? But they are going to fight a duel. And Chalon's the best swordsman in France. That's a very good suggestion, Cousin Itt. But Gomez's insurance is already paid up. How can I stop that duel? I tried that. He discovered he was left-handed. That's very sweet of you, Cousin Itt. But I believe Gomez has written his own eulogy. Well, I'll just have to work on Dr. Chalon. I must stop this duel for Gomez's sake, no matter what the price. Thank you, Cousin Itt. It's comforting to know that I look good in black. Francois. Please speak English. It sets my blood afire. Really? Please come and sit beside me. Francois, I don't want you to fight. You might get killed. Do not worry. In three strokes you are a widow. Dueling's for fools. You must go away. Only if you go with me. I'd love to, but Gomez hates to travel. - Who's Gomez? - My darling husband. What about darling me? You must choose. Well, I'd feel much better knowing you were far away, and safe. Such charm. But you do not have to choose. I stay here and duel. Well, then, duel with me. I prefer to kill your darling Gomez. - Oh, no! - Such loyalty. In a few minutes it will be "poof!" All over. - And then you can pack your things, yes? - No. I mean, I just remembered, I have to go feed Zelda. - Let Zelda feed herself. - Let a vulture feed herself? You're not yourself. Her husband hates to travel? Chalon, you are a fool. Dr. Chalon, you must call off the duel. It's off. Cowards only talk bravely. That's true, but Gomez has other good qualities. I was speaking of my cowardice. I have a yellow streak that wide down my back. Oh, is that so? I thought you were wearing suspenders. Well, it takes a brave man to admit he's a coward. But what about Morticia and Gomez? - Maybe if she slugged him - Not necessary. They are truly a perfect couple. He was willing to sacrifice himself for her, and just now, she It would have been such a beautiful sacrifice. - Good night, sir. - Good night. All right, Chalon, this is it. The moment of truth. - Chalon left. - He left? You know those yellow suspenders he was wearing? - Yes. - They're not suspenders. - Where's Francois? - He ran. Oh, good. Didn't he leave any message? What message was there to leave? He was obviously frightened by my superior swordsmanship. I may be a little rusty, but I still have what it takes. Yes, darling, you still have it. But I think I'm slipping. Darling, I'm really glad you're back in the Zen-Yogi society. Well, when I showed them this position, they welcomed me with open arms. - It's a very interesting position. - And so comfortable. The grand guru couldn't wait to try it himself. Yes, it's too bad he didn't have a stronger chandelier. We should send him a get-well card. - Lf it's not too late. - No. The hospital says he's recovering quite nicely. Oh, dear, the grand guru is going to have company. By george, that Zen-Yogi really does work. My head never felt clearer. Darling. 
There, darling, I think it's sharp enough now. Lovely, Morticia, querida mía. Hurry up, Gomez. Are you getting tired, Uncle Fester? No. I like to pose, it's so artistic. Good. I want to get the inner you. - Not with that! - That's just for carving. That's what I'm afraid of! Not for carving you, for carving your likeness. Let's have the real, the true, the unadorned you. Beautiful. Now, for immortality. Don't move, don't look, don't even breathe. - Don't worry - Don't. That's it. Hold it. By Jove, I think I've done it. Why, Gomez, you're the Michelangelo of Halloween pumpkins. How do you like it so far? Darling, you have the soul of an artist, and the touch of a surgeon. And now for the Halloween festivities. Are you both ready? - Ready on the right. - Ready on the left. Good. Now, when I count three and fire the pistol, it's every man for himself. All right? One, two, three! Remember, the first one to get an apple in his mouth wins the Halloween prize. Oh, dear. There's the doorbell. I'll get it. Uncle Fester, I can't understand a word you're saying. What I was trying to say was I was drowning! Well, it was worth it. You won the prize. Oh, goody! What do I get? This. What kind of a prize is that? Well, I had planned it for Gomez. I did so think he was going to win. It was just Pugsley and Wednesday rehearsing their trick-or-treat approach. Oh, dear. They're already out there with their little bags, and we have nothing for the other children. - I could give them each a walrus tusk. - But darling, it's Halloween. Two walrus tusks? No, no, no, dear. They want little goodies. Perfect! Bite-sized salamander sandwiches. Make a couple of hundred, Lurch. We're going to have a lot of trick-or-treaters tonight. Mama, how's the porcupine taffy coming? About done. Just have to add a few more quills. And the punch, Uncle Fester? There she blows! Well, we're almost ready for the little trick-or-treaters. When's the last time any of them came to our house? Eight years ago, but I do want to be ready. Why, Wednesday, I didn't expect you until the morning. Nobody home in the neighborhood? I told her to wear a nice ghost getup. You probably scared people to death with that horrible costume. I didn't scare anyone. Pugsley's still out trying. What's wrong? Didn't you have a good time? I had lots of fun. Oh, darling. What's this? Tears on our very own holiday? Why, all those nice witches and goblins flying around. That's just it. They told us there weren't any witches. What? What fiend uttered that vile canard? Mr. Thompson, across the street. - What a terrible thing to tell a child. - He should be horsewhipped. If I were a horse, I'd whip him. Well, I guess I'd better go up to bed. If you can't believe in witches, what can you believe in? - Oh, Gomez. - Poor little Wednesday. One careless remark and the child's ideals are crushed. Gomez, I think you ought to call that Mr. Thompson - and tell him just what his lies have done. - Excellent idea. I still think he ought to be horsewhipped. I'll get a horse. Uncle Fester, you do not make friends by whipping people. You're right, my dear. We must be civilized about these things. I'll reason with him. Thompson, you lying scoundrel! What are these vile canards that you've been telling my children? What is he saying, dear? He doesn't know what a "vile canard" means. How uncouth! Well, Thompson, what I mean is, what's the big idea of telling my children there are no witches? Really? You don't say. Well, that's an interesting point of view. Goodbye. - Well, darling, did he apologize? - Not exactly. He called me a nut. Morticia, there are witches, aren't there? Oh, of course there are, darling. Remember our Great-Great-Great-Aunt Singe? She was burned at Salem. Come here, dear. These are her ashes. That's Aunt Singe, all right. She still looks pretty good, too. Well, that settles it. We can't take this lying down. We have to prove to that little girl that witches do exist. If we could only get one witch to sit down and explain things to her. Cara mia, that's a big order. Where can we find a witch like that? - In the classifieds. - Right, just look under "W". No witches? Maybe their telephone numbers are unlisted. Oh, no, here, darling. Look. Querida, that's witch hazel. Oh, so it is. Well, perhaps we'd better advertise. Good thinking. "Witch wanted, no questions asked. " - It won't work. - Why not? Want ads closed two hours ago. Gomez, I have a truly inspirational idea. - A second honeymoon? - No, darling. If we want a witch, why don't we call on our own Aunt Singe? Won't that be a bit inconvenient? In the spirit, darling. We'll hold a séance. Oh, I love séances. Last time I talked to my dear departed brother, Clump. Did he answer? No, that's how I knew it was my brother, Clump. He was a quiet one. Then it's all settled. We'll hold a séance tonight, and throw ourselves on Aunt Singe's mercy. - You think she'll answer? - Well, of course! What right-thinking witch would turn down a child on Halloween? I always forget I frighten you. On Halloween. Sorry. Forgive me, Thing. Lurch, this is an emergency. What are you doing tonight? The movies. - Alone? - With Thing. Forget it. Tonight, you've got to stay here and help me. Well, you've got to. Imagine that Morticia and Gomez, thinking they can get a witch to pop up on an hour's notice. Especially on Halloween, the busiest night in the year. Do you realize how disappointed those children will be? I'm glad you feel that way, Lurch. So Tonight, you are a witch. Well, now, we're almost ready. Oh, dear, did you alert Cousin Cackle in his cave? He's on his way over, darling. Cousin Cackle. Good of you to come, Cousin. Same old gabby Cackle! Oh, Cousin Cackle, how good to hear your voice. You know, since you moved out to the cave, the attic just hasn't been the same. Why, of course, you may sit down. Right over here, Cousin. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. Now, let's see. Are we all here? Oh, yes, all except Pugsley. He's still out tricking and treating. Oh, why, of course, Thing, we wouldn't dream of starting without you. At a séance, every hand counts! Now, we shall try to contact Aunt Singe. Lurch! Thank you, Lurch. - We'll need a serpent's tooth. - Coming up. - It was loose anyway. - Thank you, darling. Now Now, we should really have the jawbone of an ass. Don't look at me. Jawbone. Oh, thank you, Lurch. You think of everything. Now, please put out the lights and bring me a candle. Thank you, Lurch. You may go. Now, everybody hold hands and concentrate. O noble spirits in your lofty sphere, look down upon this small ensemble. Ensemble. That's French. Darling, please! I was trying to contact Aunt Singe. Sorry, Aunty. Take hands again and concentrate. Oh, fire of Salem. Oh, flame of Satan. Come in, Aunt Singe, we're all awaitin'. Come in, Aunt Singe. Come in, Aunt Singe. Please come in. You called. By george, she answered! She may be cinders, but she's a lady. Hey, how do we really know it is Aunt Singe? Of course it's her. I'll show you. Hello, out there. If that's you, Aunt Singe, knock three times and whistle twice. If it isn't, whistle once and knock twice. Wait, you'd better make that four knocks and two whistles, if you are and one short whistle and three long knocks, if you're not. This is Aunt Singe. There. Aunt Singe, would you please say something to Wednesday? Hello, Wednesday. Please, come see us. Please! Just once. Well All right. Goody! We'll wait up for you. Morticia, you've done it. How could she resist such a loving invitation? You You rang? Yes, Lurch. Put some hot coals in the guest room. Aunt Singe is coming. Welcome, Aunt Singe! Oh, cara. - I hope Aunt Singe likes children. - Oh, all witches love children. Remember Hansel and Gretel? They almost wound up in an oven, but until then, that old witch couldn't have been nicer. Couldn't possibly. And then she wound up in the oven. Some children are so unappreciative. I hope Aunt Singe doesn't disappoint Wednesday. I asked you to be a voice, not make a personal appearance. Now where am I gonna find a witch? Hiring hall? I guess I'll just have to go out and see what's flying around. Darling, am I disturbing your thoughts? No, querida, that's my favorite song. Gomez. I was playing It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary. - Well, then that's my favorite song. - You are an angel. And a worried one. What if Aunt Singe doesn't appear tonight? - Little Wednesday will be heartbroken. - Oh, dear, that's true. Maybe we should buy her a nice gift, just in case. Capital idea. What will it be? Well, you know how fond children are of pets. A new pet, perfect. I'll have Lurch get my hat. I think the bell's out of order. No problem. - You rang? - My hat and cane, Lurch. Thank you. Problem is solved. Such dash, such style, such savoir-faire. Tish, you spoke French. Darling, please! The pet. Yes. I'll be back in half an hour on this watch. Twenty minutes on this one. - Yes, Lurch, what is it? - Mr. Addams. Back so soon? Wants you to close your eyes. Ah, yes. A surprise. Dear Wednesday will be so thrilled. Very well, my love. Open your eyes. Gomez! What a lovely gift. A yak. Darling, that's a horse. It is? There is a resemblance. Resemblance? Look at these blue ribbons. Oh, he won them? I bought them. Thought they'd look nice on him. They will, darling, they will. Now, let's see, what shall we name him? How about Fido? Fido? For a horse? - Rover? - Much better. - Ever see such lines on an animal? - Never. He's highly trained, too. Watch. All right, now, Rover. Ten-hut! Ever see a quicker, more intelligent animal? - He's almost human. - He counts, too. Watch. All right, Rover, how many fingers? He hates to show off. I'll make it a little easier for you. How many now? By george, he guessed it. Well, Aunt Singe. Uncle Fester, does that look like Aunt Singe? - You mean, it isn't? - It's a horse. Are you sure? Not only a beautiful animal, but smart, too. He can count to ten. Big deal. I can count to 20. - The horse didn't go to school. - Neither did I. Good point. Oh, hello, Wednesday darling. Come and see the new pet we have for you. Do you like him? He's very nice, but I'd rather have a spider. A spider or a horse, darling, what's the difference? But I'd rather have a spider. All right, a spider it is. A beautiful black widow spider. - Back goes Rover. Sorry, old man. - No! I'll take him, and if I hear any more subversive talk from our neighbor, Thompson Horsewhip! Come on, Rover. It's your turn, dear. Here's the list. You and your silly friends and their silly Halloween scavenger hunt. But, Penelope, it's all part of the Halloween fun. Fun, my foot. But at least it got us out of the house, so I didn't have to face those pesky little trick-or-treaters. Darling, you look just fine in your witch's costume. It fits you perfectly. - What? - I mean the size is right. How much longer do you intend to keep up this nonsense? Just till we get the three last items. Now, you try this house, and I'll try the next one. Halloween! The ridiculous things people do on Halloween! - Look, I'm - I know. Mama sent you. Nobody sent me. Then you must be Follow me. Visitor from spirit world. By george, you made it. Welcome to our humble, earthly abode. Well, have you people been on a scavenger hunt. Could you spare a few things? I've got to find three items. Would you have a Louisville bat, black? Gomez, darling, do they come in any other colors? From Louisville, I don't know. But we can get you some hometown black bats from the attic. Good evening, Aunt Singe. Aunt Singe? I don't know what you're talking about. You must have mistaken me for someone else. Oh, no, no, no, we didn't. That's an Addams face if I ever saw one. Look at that chin, dear. - Flabby, weak, receding. - Beautiful. Aunty, and here's a broom, and if you could do a few quick turns around the room, I'm sure Wednesday would appreciate it. Turns? - The bats. - Live bats! Why didn't somebody tell me Aunt Singe was here? I was just catching a little snooze, up in my tree. Did you say up in your Oh, isn't that sweet. Even Kitty cat's come down to welcome you. The emotional reunion must have been too much for her. Well, that's the way it goes on Halloween. You have to keep on the move. Oh, I'm so glad she kept her promise, and I'm very happy she's using our broom. Listen everybody, I've got bad news. Aunt Singe isn't coming. - Oh? - Isn't coming? No, I just left her, and she said to tell you she's sorry, but on account of the big Halloween rush But, Mama, Aunt Singe was just here. She was? Oh, yes, and whatever she told you about the holiday rush is quite true. Why, she flew right out the window. Yes, she even forgot her hat. Beautiful. We ought to do this every day! Oh, dear, there's the doorbell. I'll get it. What is it, darling? It's a note from our neighbor, Mr. Thompson. Oh, what does he say? Well, he says he apologizes for calling me a nut. He's now convinced there are witches, and in fact he's threatening to call the police unless we get that witch off our roof. There's a witch on our roof? - What's up? - There's a witch on our roof. There's nothing of the kind. - How do you know? - I was just up there. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family It's no use. Nothing seems to calm my nerves. Mine either. I couldn't believe my eyes when we drove past and saw them holding the charity bazaar without even calling on us, or even informing us. Darling, it was probably an oversight. Maybe they called and we weren't home. Impossible. Watch this. Thing never misses a phone call. Sorry, Thing. False alarm. What reason could they possibly have for not letting us know? We've always donated more than our share. Who else would give them a beautiful stuffed python crushing a water buffalo? Or the chopping block of Ivan the Terrible, with the original nick still in it? I even threw in the henchmen's ax that made those nicks. You didn't. Well, I got carried away. Darling, you're generous to a fault. That's true. Did you see some of the junk the other people gave? It certainly takes no imagination to donate an original Van Gogh. Right. Now, if someone donated his ear The trouble is it's for such a worthy cause, a new home for the aged. I feel we should do our share. Well, if that's all that's worrying you, forget it. It's all taken care of. I'm building a home for the aged of our own. Darling, how wonderful. There'll be a special ramp just for skateboarding. What about tennis courts? Tennis courts and a polo field. Darling, you're wonderful. You'll put that other home right out of business. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to surprise you. - Mother. Father. - Mother. Father. Darling, the children. - What's that for? - For later. I don't want to lose my place. Yes, children, it is a lovely day. Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. - Hello. - Hello, darlings. We found a picture, but we don't know whose it is. Sure is a slick looker. - Well, probably me. - It's a she. Here she is, Mother. Isn't she beautiful? Sure has pretty hair. And a nice smile. Why, that's my mother. Your Granny Frump. That's Granny Frump? When she was a teenager. - Sure is pretty. - A dazzler. Sure has changed. Well, darling, you have to remember, she's a lot older now. I wish she was still as pretty. She is. Except now, it's on the inside. On the inside? I'll show you. There. Ever see anything more beautiful than that? I have a lovely idea. Next week is my mother's birthday, and with Grandmama Addams vacationing on Devil's Island, why don't I call on Granny Frump and have her spend a few days with us? By all means. And for her birthday, we could send her to Barbara Benson's Beauty Farm. Perhaps in a week or two, they could bring some of her beauty back and put it on the outside. It would probably be more like a year or two. Why quibble about time? It's only money, and besides, nothing's too good for your mother. It'd be worth anything to see her look like that again. Well, you can't expect miracles, darling. I'll call Granny and ask her to come and stay with us. But I want her birthday present to be a surprise until her birthday. - Okay. - Okay. - You promise? - Cross my heart. - Me, too. - That's wonderful, children. Now, run out into the kitchen and get a snack. Lurch has baked a lovely soufflé of aardvark. Couldn't I just have a little bowl of sea slug? For dessert, darling, for dessert. Now to find my place. Mrs. Frump. Lurch, you sure look terrible. - Mother! - Morticia. Mother. You look terrible, too. Well, don't just stand there, take the bags. Oh, Mother, I told you not to. Well, I had to buy something for the children. You spoil them dreadfully. Lurch, put that up in the guest room. I'll show it to the children later. They get such a thrill out of your gifts. Granny Frump, I thought I heard you. Stop slobbering. Let me look at you. You look worst of all. - It's this light. - Nothing wrong with the light. - That's the trouble. - I'll call the children. No, no. I'll go up and surprise them. Maybe scare them a little. All right, Agent Double-000, are you going to tell me what I want to know? No. Surprise. Granny! Say, you kids look like a couple of ghosts. Gosh, thanks, Granny. What're you doing? Playing Chinese water torture. Nice game. Clean, too. Granny, are you in for a big surprise. I am? Remember, Pugsley, you crossed your heart. I wasn't going to tell her anything, except that Mother and Father are going to send her away. Send me away? Where to? That's the secret. I bet it's the jungle. That hot, steaming jungle. Great for my sinuses. Well, gotta unpack. Wait till you kids see what I brought you. Really kill you. Hi, Granny. What're you doing? I'm manicuring my fingernails. Fear I have a little too much iron in my blood. Gomez and Morticia are planning to send me away. Happen to know where? I didn't hear anything. Not even a hint? Well, let's see, yesterday they were talking about a bazaar and a home for the aged. Oh, no. They're not planning to send me away, they're planning to put me away. Well, what's the difference? Send or put? When Morticia wanted to go to work at the age of 10, did I stop her? No. When she had pneumonia and wanted to run out in the snow and play, did I stop her? No. When she tried to run away from home, did I stop her? No. And what's my reward? An old folk's home. Well, that's it. A perfect gift for a person who has everything. There you are, Gomez, darling. I wanted you to send a check to Barbara Benson's Beauty Farm. I've arranged for my mother to stay there for two weeks. I know it's the best birthday present we can possibly give her. I'll make a memo so I don't forget. What's all this other paperwork, dear? Some notes and plans for my home for the aged. I've added an ice skating rink and a ski jump for winter sports. How thoughtful. Here's the combination kitchen and garage, and there's the recreation room and discotheque. - For men or women? - Both. - Together? - Querida, you're forgetting, this is a home for the aged. You wicked man. Fester, I just know I'm right. I just know they're planning to put me out to pasture. Well, you are the outdoor type. Look. "Home for the aged"! Look at this. "Send check to cover Granny's reservation. " You see, you were afraid they were gonna put you out to pasture. They're just going to send you to a reservation. No, no. They're going to send me to a home for the aged, and I don't want to go. Hey, maybe if you show them how much pep you still got, you know, make yourself useful around the house. Oh, Fester, I could just kiss you. I was only trying to help. Are you all right, deary? If there's anything you want, let me get it for you. - Just fine, Mother. - That's just your imagination. I'll fix you a little snack. Some porcupine cookies, a bit of mongoose broth. I just had lunch, dear. Well, how about an ottoman for your feet? Shall I open the window? - But the window is open. - Then I'll close it. Well, of course, it's chilly in here. I'll get you a blanket, too. A nice itchy one. Gomez. Gomez, darling. That name. It drives me wild. Especially when I'm shaving. I'm sorry. I didn't see you, Gomez. I'll get a double blanket for you. What's the matter with her? I was just going to ask you that. Glad I asked first. She's probably still a bit upset after her trip. Two weeks at the beauty farm should help. Can't hurt. There, that'll keep you both warm. Mother, why don't you go downstairs to the playroom and stretch out on the bed of nails? You need a little relaxation. Me, relax? Never. Go, go, go. That's me. Give me that. Just love to dust and do things around the house. - Mother. - Just call me busy fingers. I think I'll dust my way right up to the attic, and when I finish that, I'll do the yard. Just gotta keep go, go, going. Go, go, go, go. Dusting the yard? That's ridiculous. Of course it is. Lurch has already dusted it. Yes, Lurch, what is it? Mrs. Frump, washed the clothes, polished the silverware. I think I better have a talk with my mother. You know, deep inside, she's really a wonderful person. Of course she is. You can tell by her picture. - Mother. - Doing dishes. Yesiree, Bob! That's the life. I like drying them even better. Well, that's that. Fixed dinner for tonight, dinner for tomorrow's cooking, ordered groceries for a month, set the table and packed the children's lunch. Well, I heard Lurch say the car's been acting up. Think I'll give it a good overhauling. Mother. - Sorry. Too busy. - Mother, Mother. Now, listen, you've got to stop trying to do so much. Think I'm too old? Ridiculous. Mother, Mother. No, darling, it isn't that. It's just that this is Lurch's domain and he feels you're invading it. Besides, you should relax more at your age. At my age? I never felt better in my life. Until just now. Don't worry, Granny Frump, I'll cheer you up. How? By reciting the poem I wrote. "I have a gloomy little spider "I love to sit down close beside her "She never knows where she has been 'Cause all she does is spin and spin "My spider's quite a busy roamer "Which is why I called her Homer "She loves to work and spin all day "And then, at night, she likes to play "Her web is like my mother's hair "Her eyes have got my father's stare "She may not jump, or twist, or bend "But a spider's a girl's best friend" Did you like it? It's sweet, but I'm still sad. This is my favorite picture of you when you were so young and beautiful. Were? I still am. Oh, sure, but now it's only on the inside. Inside, huh? Well, I'm gonna put it on the outside. Hi. I don't believe it. - You don't believe what? - See for yourself. I don't believe it. Yes. Yes, we appreciate that. Then we'll expect you right after dinner? Thank you very much. Goodbye. That's the hardest phone call I've ever had to make. Yes, a far cry from making reservations for your mother at Barbara Benson's to making them at the Happy Valley Institute. I just hope we did the right thing. Well, you saw for yourself. Pogo sticks, jump rope. Right now, she's upstairs playing cops and robbers. Stick 'em up! Don't worry, querida, Dr. Jonley has a fine reputation. One look at Granny, and he'll know exactly what to do for her. Oh, Gomez, I don't know what would've become of me if I hadn't met you. You were fortunate, my dear. How about a go at the trains, just to relax? Splendid idea. I'll operate the switches. You can blow up the train. Oh, no, darling, you blow up the trains. I know how you love those wrecks. Naturally. I had one go through the ceiling yesterday. - You didn't. - Oh, yeah. Shower of plaster and everything. You've been practicing. Used some of Pugsley's TNT. Young fellow really knows how to mix an explosive. Makes a mother proud. All right, my dear, as soon as the last car clears this tunnel, count three and - Wonderful. - All right, start them up. Faster. Faster. Let them go wild. Maybe one of them will fly off the track. Yes, darling, yes. I love runaway trains. All right, now, as soon as the train clears the tunnel Now, that's what I call a real mystery. Fester must have been fooling around with this. Something like this always happens when he does. Beautiful. Didn't hit the ceiling. Darling, you can't win them all. How do you do, Mrs. Addams? I'm Dr. Jonley. I'm Mr. Addams. This is Mrs. Addams. Oh, I'm so sorry. It must be the light, or maybe it's my glasses. It is my glasses. I'm not wearing them. I'm so sorry. I'm Dr. Jonley. - How do you do, Mrs. Addams? - How do you do? - Won't you come in? - Thank you. Doctor, we asked you to stop by because a member of our family has been behaving, well, strangely. I understand. And we thought perhaps by your talking Hi! Oh, he should be put away immediately. Oh, no, he's not the one. Fester, this is the head Oh, I'm sorry, I got no time now. Big news. Gotta see Granny. Well, nice talking to you. Dear, would you tell Granny we'd like to see her? Roger. Bye! Are you sure he's not the one? Just a minute. Come in. Okay, you can forget the kid stuff. I wish I could. It's making me old fast. Well, I got big news for you. You mean they're gonna send me away anyway? Yep, but not to the home for the aged. That's something that Gomez is building. They're sending you to a beauty farm. A beauty farm? Yeah, it was a surprise, but I got Pugsley and Wednesday to tell me. What a relief. Yeah, they wanna see you downstairs. There's some fella there. I think he runs the place. Just a minute. One thing I don't understand. What's that? Why they wanna send me to a beauty farm. Pogo stick. The jumping rope. They're typical regressions to a second childhood. Yes, yes, yes, these things are very difficult to handle at the home level. But at Happy Valley, there's something wrong with a patient who isn't jumping rope or dancing the Watusi. Morticia? Oh, there you are. Mother, this gentleman is here You needn't explain, Morticia. I know all about the place, and I'm all for it. You are? Oh, well, isn't that nice? Could be a real lifesaver. Oh, Gomez, I'm not that bad. - Am I? - No, no, no, not at all. These cases have to be handled with kid gloves. Who told you about our place? Oh, I've heard about it for years. Some of my best friends have been there. Granny, we don't want you to get the idea that we're trying to get rid of you. Get rid of me? Why, I want to go. There's one thing we must insist on, though, and that's a quiet room. I do hope your walls are well insulated. We have a few where the walls are padded. Oh, Gomez, I don't know how much extra it would cost, but I would certainly like to have one of those. One padded room coming up. Oh, I may never want to leave. Let's go. You can ship my things, Morticia. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Looks like we did the right thing. Oh, the poor dear, she's further gone than I thought. Well, as long as it makes her happy. Tokyo, Fujiyama Osaka It's a little something I composed, darling. Do you like it? I don't know about the melody, but I love the words. Yes, the words are the best part. Darling, you've been hanging there for three hours. Aren't you getting a little tired? Tired? This is the perfect way to relax. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. It's from my mother. How's she getting along? She's doing nicely. Listen to this. "I really like this place. You meet a very nice class of people. "Though I'm looking much better, "Dr. Jonley thinks I might have to stay a lot longer than he thought. "Love, Mother. " I knew it. It's her kind of place. Mother, what are you doing here? Some beauty farm. There wasn't a person there who could give me a permanent. Don't worry, darling, I can tell just by looking at you that you're all well. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Uncle Fester, I don't think Mama will like you playing with her crystal ball. Well, while she's cooking I thought I'd see if I could read it. Find anything interesting yet, Fester? I'm trying to read Morticia's future. What do you see, Uncle Fester? Incredible monster with beady, little eyes and a forehead like a gorilla. You're looking at your own reflection, Fester. I thought he looked familiar. Wait a minute. I'm beginning to read something. Morticia, it says that your school chum, Trivia, is coming here to visit. I told you that yesterday, dear. Oh, yeah, I could have sworn I saw it in the crystal ball. Wait a minute. Somebody's trying to send us a message. I see some words. There are some words, but they're rather fuzzy. Maybe it's Trivia trying to get through. - Now I can read it. - What does it say? It says, "Made in Japan. " Miss Trivia. - Oh, Trivia. - Darling. Trivia, you certainly look well for you. Nice of you to say so. We thought you were getting married. Oh, I was on the verge, but I just couldn't go through with it. - Why not? - He never asked me. - Besides, my heart's in showbiz. - Showbiz? Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day yeah Beautiful. How's showbiz treating you, Trivia? They love me in Altoona. One reviewer compared my scene to the mating call of a platypus. - No wonder they're becoming extinct. - Uncle Fester. - Allow me. - Why, thank you, Lurch, darling. - What's the matter with Lurch? - He is acting rather peculiarly. I bet he had some of Mama's salamander puffs. He just can't eat rich deserts. Well, as we show folks say, I think I'll take five and go freshen up a bit. Traveling, it's such a tiring bore. Of course, dear. Lurch, take Miss Trivia's things up to her room, please. Yes, Mrs. Addams. Lurch, no! I said, Miss Trivia's things, not Miss Trivia. Sorry, lost my head. I'll have to apologize for Lurch. I don't understand what came over him. I can. He's in love. Lurch in love? Impossible. Well, who can he be in love with around here? Poor boys There just seems to be something about me they simply can't resist. I wonder what it could be. How do you feel about Lurch? Well, he's rather cute, but I have no time for love. Showbiz is my entire life. Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky Oh boy I'm lucky - With a voice like that she should get life. - This calls for some nerve settling. Poor Lurch, love at first sight. - Maybe, he should take a second look. - They would make a handsome couple. Oh, well, c'est la vie. Tish, you spoke French. Gomez, darling, please, there is a time and place for everything. - How about here and now? - Dear, I'm worried about Lurch. - Who's Lurch? - Our butler. Oh, Lurch. Yes. I think we should find out how serious he is about Trivia. Good idea. Maybe it's just temporary insanity. - You rang? - Yes, Lurch. I Well, that is, we, couldn't help but notice how taken you were with Miss Trivia. Oh! Come, come now, Lurch, your feelings are written all over your face. Just look at him. By george, Morticia, you're right. If I ever saw a love-sick expression. - He's sick all right. - Oh, it's so romantic. Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky Here she comes again, Lurch. Now, just walk right up to her and tell her how you feel. No. Well, nothing to it, old man. Well, we'll be in the conservatory watching. After all, two is company. And with Trivia, it could be a crowd. - Well, where is everybody? - Watching. - He sure thinks fast on his feet. - Watching? Who? Oh, well, it doesn't matter. I've got to get on with my rehearsing. Showbiz, you know. Miss Trivia Yes, Lurch, you wanted to say something? Speak up, speak up. I've got no time for idle chatter. Nice day. That's not much of a proposal, but it's a good weather report. Is that all you wanted to tell me? Well, what else? Come, come. I have got to get on with my career. You and Oh, I know. You want my autograph, right? No? Oh, of course, you're trying to tell me you're smitten with me. Naturally, but my heart's still in showbiz. Well, better luck next time. Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day Oh, dear This is going to be terrible for poor Lurch's ego. Not to mention his personality, either. - Yeah, he's such a fun kid. - Bit on the shy side, though. - A bit. - I have an idea. If we can only change Trivia's mind about Lurch. How can we? You heard her, all she cares about is showbiz. But if we could convince her that Lurch is even more exciting She might give it all up for him. That's a capital idea, querida. Oh, but we can never do that. We'd have to make a whole new man out of him. I'll just fire a volley of the old Addams spirit into him. Wednesday and I could work on his social graces. They have been sadly neglected. Yeah, and after a couple of hours with me, why, he'll know all there is to know about women. - What do you know about women, Fester? - Well, I had a mother, didn't I? Take it from an old Latin lover, Lurch. Nothing brings out the woman in the woman more than the man in the man. Trivia sees you in a gaucho outfit, she'll be a goner. I hope so. Well, look what it did for Valentino. When she sees you've mastered the bola, that will really knock her for a loop. Now, watch. Watch carefully. Style The form Now, the crucial thing about the bola is knowing exactly when to let go. A split second too soon or a split second too late Let that be a lesson to you. Oh, Gomez, darling, did you help Lurch? I tried to teach him the mastery of the South American bola. - You're an expert at that. - Yes, but I'm afraid he's a slow learner. - Not all men have your talents, darling. - Or yours. Oh, by george, Morticia. You have outdone yourself. What is it? Well, I was going to call it Mishmosh at Dawn, - but I'm afraid that's a bit pretentious. - Well, you may be right. I think I'll call it just plain, simple Blob. It's perfect. Well, I think I'll have another go at Lurch. Perhaps modern dance this time. Oh, darling, Wednesday's teaching him that. Oh, capital. Blob, however did you think of it? Well, actually I heard someone describing my last painting that way. And it inspired me. - Querida. - Darling. This is the latest. It's called the Droop. - Come on, now you try it. - Me? - I think Miss Trivia's a swinger. - Swinger? You don't want her to think you're square, do you? Then if you learn how to dance well, she'll think you're boss. "Boss"? Neat Groovy Come on. Try it. Loosen up a little, let yourself go. Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day You got it, Lurch! Oh, what a pleasant surprise. I thought the mazurka went out ages ago. Wednesday, darling, you're excused. - Please turn off the phonograph. - Yes, Mother. Lurch, the music has stopped. I know, but I can't. Now, here we are, darling. Now, Cleopatra, Mother knows best, dear. You simply must get on a low-calorie diet. Open up Cleopatra, your tentacles are getting thick. Open up! - Querida. - Good morning, darling. Oh, my! You look a bit under. Glad to hear it, because that's the way I feel. Couldn't get a wink of sleep with Lurch moaning all the night. Oh, yes. I heard him, too. Moaning and walking the floor. Sounded like a herd of elephants. Where is he? I haven't seen him this morning. He's probably with Uncle Fester finishing his course in the feminine mystique. Good. If I know Fester, he'll pull no punches. He's a man's man. And now, Lurch, my boy, you and I are going to have a man-to-man talk. Now, the first thing is we I seem to be a man short. Lurch! Now, if you wanna make any headway with Trivia, you've gotta understand all about women. And that's my department. Now, the most important thing is the proper approach. Now, I'll be Trivia. Oh boy I'm lucky They say I'm lucky This is my lucky day Well, pick it up. Keep going. No No! That's not what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to take it and say, "Pardon me, you dropped your handkerchief. "How about a date tonight, baby?" You got it? Okay, now try it again. Oh boy I'm lucky This is my lucky Poise, Lurch, poise. Dropped handkerchief. How about a - What's the matter, Lurch? - You're not my type. I'm going to end it all. Oh, good! Now, we're getting someplace. Well, how are things in the school of romance? School just let out. Lurch is going to end it all. That's ridiculous. You can't do away with yourself just like that. - That's right. You gotta leave a note. - Exactly. Spoken like a man, Lurch. We have to find just the right note. Something that will make Trivia come to her senses. Yeah, make her realize what a good catch she could have had. Be a real happy ending. Make a note, Thing. - How about, "Dear Trivia"? - No, it sounds a little flat. You know, a note like this should start off with a real grabber for Trivia to find in Lurch's outstretched hand. Good thinking, Fester. How about, "Farewell beloved"? No suspense. You give away the whole ending. Fester, you're a born showman. How's this, "To Whom It May Concern"? Bingo! Changed my mind. Changed your mind? Lurch, there no sense just hanging around being miserable, is there? No, maybe, we could figure out some glamorous way for him to go like - Jumping off the roof. - Too messy. Lurch, how do you feel about gas? - Gives me heartburn. - Yeah, me too. Forget about it. This is a happy little group! Is Lurch's problem solved? Beautifully, he's gonna end it all. Very romantic, but isn't that a bit extreme? Did Romeo and Juliet think it was a bit extreme? Certainly not. And they lived happily ever after. - Or did they? - No, Uncle Fester, they did not. Besides, where would we find a replacement for dear Lurch. Querida, your wisdom is exceeded only by your great beauty. French! And bubele, too. Gomez, not now, not now. We gotta solve Lurch's problem first. Oh, yes, Lurch's problem. Lurch, I think you should sweep Miss Trivia off her feet. Yes, Mrs. Addams. - Thank you, Thing. - No, Lurch. Forget about the sweeping. Miss Trivia is very musical-minded. Why don't you appeal to that side of her nature? - Serenade her? - Exactly. Ah, that's our Lurch, willing to try anything. - Tish, our song. - Hits you right here. Lurch, you try it. I think we better forget about the serenading. We'll just have to leave it up to Mama. - Mama? - Yes, she's going to work on dear Trivia. Well, if anyone can do it, it's Mama. She's a real femme fatale. I spoke French. Bye! Is it true you're really going to help Lurch's romance, Grandmother? Well, you can't leave these things to amateurs. What are you going to do? I'm going about it scientifically. A love potion. Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky Oh, Trivia! Is someone calling me? Come and get your yak juice. - Yak juice? - Nice and scalding. Oh, good, it does wonders for my complexion. - Where's that man? - Coming up. You rang? Lurch, you great big, wonderful hunk of masculinity. Well, I guess you two love birds wanna be alone. Where, oh, where have you been all my life? The kitchen. Nothing like a leisurely stroll on the freeway. I'm yours, Lurch. My heart, my soul, my bank account. It looks like my coaching paid off. Lurch really hit pay dirt. Looks more like an avalanche. Tell me you love me, Lurch. Tell me, tell me, tell me. Oh, say it again. Oh, please. Bashful, eh? I'll unbashful you. - Changed mind. - Come back! Come back, Lurch! Ah, dear Trivia. She's finally come to her senses. I guess old Lurch just broke down her resistance. He does have an irresistible charm. Reminds me of Casanova Addams. When he toyed with women's hearts? When he was jailed for nonpayment of alimony. - Let me in, Lurch. - No. Ah, Trivia. Gomez! You great big, lovable brute. - Is there some mistake? - Certainly not! You're a man, aren't you? You're drunk with love, you don't know what you're doing. I may be drunk with love, but I know what I'm doing. Oh, Gomez! Gosh, it sure is quiet around here. Quiet and full of love. Love? Lurch and Trivia have finally found each other. Well, I could see where he'd have a little trouble finding her. They've fallen in love. I can't see where she'd have any trouble - Love? - Madly. Well, it may not be an ideal marriage, - but it'll certainly make an ideal divorce. - Oh, no, Uncle Fester. Trivia's a one-man woman. - Gomez, darling, what's wrong? - Trivia, she's in love with me. You better make that a two-man woman. Gomez, that's impossible. You're a married man. I think that sort of slipped Trivia's mind. I tried to get away, but she was like a tigress. Oh, dear. I can't believe it. My best friend, a husband-stealer. She could get in trouble doing that. That's petty larceny. Fester, you've gotta calm her down. You have to explain to her what it would do to Lurch if he found out she was hopelessly in love with me. Better explain what it would do to me, too. Don't worry, I'll straighten it out. Darling, isn't it a comfort to have a person like Uncle Fester to take things in hand. You beautiful, delicious man! I'm mad for you! This is destiny. Haven't you got me mixed up with Gomez, or is it Lurch? All I know is I'm mad, mad, mad for you. - You know something, I think you're fickle. - Only as far as men are concerned. Trivia! I thought you were in love with Gomez. And I thought you were in love with Lurch. Oh, those were just silly, little infatuations. This is the man I really love. But I'm a confirmed bachelor. - Since when? - Since - Just now! - I just love it when they play hard to get. Itt! You marvelous mountain of hair. Oh, you know just what to say to a woman. Gomez, this thing with Trivia has gone far enough. You're absolutely right. Jilting me for Fester. Uncle Fester does have an inner magnetism. Yes, he does have that certain je ne sais quoi. Tish, that's French, I wish you'd said that. - Trivia now, darling, je ne sais quoi later. - You said it. Later, darling. Later. Later. You're the only man I've ever loved. You have a girl? Excuses! Excuses! This is destiny. Fate! Tell me you love me. Tell me, tell me, tell me. Say it again. Either that's Cousin Itt or Uncle Fester needs a shave. You delicious man. Cousin Itt, I'm so glad I found you. Trivia, what's the meaning of this? You can't do this to Lurch and Fester and - Well, you can forget about me. - Oh, I have. I have. I found my one, my true What's the matter with him? Why are you staring at me that way? Oh! Something happened here. What? - Well, we thought you were in love. - Love! Me? Oh, silly. Well, I've got to be going. Showbiz is calling. Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky I'll help her pack. This is my lucky day - Lurch seems eager to get rid of her. - I guess he's fickle, too. In that case, it's too bad. They would have made a perfect match. Poor Lurch. We failed him. And when I think of how beautiful it could have all been. If only he had taken that final step. - Into matrimony? - Off the roof. Well, we all make mistakes. I still can't understand what went wrong. This stuff always worked before. Well, I'm sort of glad. - Now Lurch won't leave. - That's true. I think I'll go feed my spiders. Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day - What is it, Mama? - Age, my boy. Just age. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family There's nothing like after-dinner music. It's so soothing, it's making me drowsy. Darling, I think you had a bit too much dinner. I've been doing this all day, and it keeps coming out the same. That's your genius, my dear. You, too, Mama. Couldn't resist that stew of yours. You can't beat a good old-fashioned yak stew. I shot the yak myself. I'm afraid I overdid it, though. I had three helpings. Five helpings. Uncle Fester, please. It isn't easy eating and counting. I am getting sleepy. It's time you hit the sack. Splendid idea. You rang. Yes, Lurch, Mr. Addams wishes to hit the sack. Thank you, Lurch. Poor darling. He was sleepy. Gomez? Darling, where are you going? Out. Walk in night. Uncle Fester, Gomez just went out sleepwalking. Nice night for it. Yes, it is. I'd join him if I were asleep. I do hope he took his key. There. Then he came home at 4:00 this morning with mud all over his shoes. Well, that's better than lipstick all over his shirt. Good morning, my dear, Uncle Fester. Where is everyone this morning? - Morning? - Darling, it's 4:00 in the afternoon. Well, no wonder I feel so well. Eighteen hours sleep without waking up once. Well, what's for lunch? Some more of that yak stew? We really must speak to that newspaper boy. I distinctly told him I wanted the paper delivered at 3:00. Hey, see this story? It says that there's a cat burglar in our neighborhood. Really? Let's see. Oh, yes. "Cat burglar strikes. - "Two homes robbed. " - Cat burglar, eh? I hope he doesn't try to steal our cat. Dear Kitty is such a shy little thing. Don't worry. This burglar steals only jewelry, furs and money. Well, he better not try to rob our house. Why, I'll give him a karate chop, that's what I'll give him. That's a pretty song. Morticia, what's the matter with Gomez? Oh, it looks like dear Gomez overdid it again. Too much of Mama's stew. Just like his father. Mr. Addams loved my yak gravy on glutton bread. - Mama, isn't that gluten bread? - Not the way he ate it. Gomez, dear, I think you better get up and take a little stroll around the cave. - Too late. - Fester, turn off the music. Poor Gomez. I do hope he doesn't walk in his sleep again tonight. Walk? With the dinner he packed away, he'll be lucky if he can stand up. I just worry that he might meet that awful cat burglar in a dark alley. Don't worry, Morticia. I won't let him out of the house tonight. I won't let him out of the house tonight. I'll sit up in front of his door. You mean stay awake all night? Only if you promise to sleep with ear plugs. No need the both of us staying awake. Oh, you are a darling. Are you sure he won't get out? Not with "never sleep" Fester on guard. Gonna have a little bedtime snack. Fester? Fester. I heard noise. So, as it turned out, I needn't have worried at all. When I woke this morning, there was dear Gomez asleep beside me, and his shoes were right where he'd left them. Except they were covered with mud. That Mama is a sloppy cleaner. I thought maybe he'd gone out. With me standing guard? Never closed an eye. I think you're right, Lurch. It doesn't belong there. Try that space opposite the mantle. Morticia, what is that? It's my new painting. I call it Children at Play. Put it over there. I'm so glad dear Gomez didn't go out last night. You know that awful cat burglar was on the prowl again. - He was? - Yes. It's in all the newspapers. They're full of it. - Full of what, my dear? Sex? - Crime. Sex and crime, America's favorite breakfast diet. "Cat burglar strikes again. Six homes robbed. " - He's a real ambitious fella. - Shame! Darling, don't you worry about that cat burglar. I'm sure the police will track him down. Speaking of tracks, I had the most fascinating dream last night. I dreamt I was walking along a dark street, and I stepped into a mud puddle with my new shoes. - The ones you got for our wedding? - The very ones. - Now that's what I call a realistic dream. - You sure you haven't been out? - Impossible. - Of course. I must've picked up the mud down in the cave. Well, no problem. Thing. Uncle Fester, I want you to accompany me to the storeroom. I'd like a word with the man who never sleeps. - I tell you, I never shut my eyes. - Did you sleep with them open? No, I was on the alert all Look at all the loot. Morticia, you don't think Gomez! A cat burglar. What else? I've heard of guys taking moonlight jobs, but this is ridiculous. And I don't want to tell dear Gomez. It'll unsettle him terribly. Of course. He's such an honest thief. We just must make sure he doesn't leave this house. Hey, I know. Why don't I sit up all night and guard his door? I No, we tried that, didn't we? - I know what's causing Gomez trouble. - You do? It's that yak stew of mine. I just remembered. His father used to react the same way. That's why I quit making it. Oh, dear. Lurch, there's a big bowl of it left in the refrigerator. - Get rid of it at once. - Yes, Mrs. Addams. Mama, you'd better get started on another pot of stew. I just finished this one off. - Gomez, you didn't. - I didn't? Then what's this on my necktie? He ate it. Well, I'm off to the library. Time to play with my train. The cat burglar strikes again. Uncle Fester, Mama, what am I going to do? - Gomez needs help. - He certainly does need help. With a load like he brought home last night, he's liable to strain his back. Morticia, why don't we get him a wheelbarrow? Uncle Fester, please. We must find out what makes him steal. We must delve into his subconscious mind. Find out what it is - That's it. Psychic control. - Psychic what? The snake charmer and the snake. Psychic control. The snake charmer and the Perfect for Gomez. Darling, are you sure that thing is in tune? Gomez, dear, please. It's just a game. Now listen. Listen carefully. Querida, you know I don't like the flute. Glockenspiel, the sousaphone, yes. But the flute? Gomez, darling, concentrate. Yeah, Gomez, concentrate. It's so beautiful. So soothing, so Well, that Fester's really a sleepy one. Uncle Fester! Well, how did you make out? Say, he looks better already. Fester, dear, we haven't started yet. Oh, Morticia, I don't think you're playing the right tune for Gomez. - How about another song? - Another tune? How about this? My favorite song. So soft, so docile, so Mama! So sorry. That flute of yours has a strange effect on people. Not all people. I wonder if a bugle would have the same effect. Concentrate, querida, concentrate. Now, with the help of this book, we'll find out what makes him steal and cure him. '"Psychiatry For Fun and Profit, '"or What To Do If Your Analyst's Line Is Busy. '" Very interesting. Now, Uncle Fester, you and Mama please leave us alone. These psychiatrists, when they get someone on the couch, they want everybody to leave. Now I want you to listen carefully. When you open your eyes, you will be in your doctor's office. I am your psychiatrist. Now open your eyes. I am going to show you some pictures, and I want you to tell me what they remind you of. - Sounds like fun. - All right. Here's the first one. - Now, what does that remind you of? - Stealing. Stealing? What about this one? Robbing. Robbing? How about this one? Robbing the rich. - Everything reminds you of robbing? - Naturally. He's my idol. - Who? - Robin Hood. I'm reading a book about him. - How are you doing? - Uncle Fester, I think this is it. When he steals, he's imitating his hero, Robin Hood. Yeah, but Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor. That's right. Well, Gomez never gave anything away. It's still in the storeroom. Of course. He's only halfway through the book. That's it. Now that we know why he steals, we can make him stop it. - Hide the book? - Oh, yes. Not only that. Now that he's hypnotized, I'll make him stop walking in his sleep. Yeah, you better with all that yak stew in him. I'm going to give you an order and you will obey. Will obey. First, you must promise to return everything you've stolen. Promise. Oh, dear. I better get the wheelbarrow. Morticia, I thought we'd stand guard till you got here. You are a dear. Is he resting peacefully? Sleeping like a babe. Show her, Lurch. I thought we might just chain him in, just in case. I tell you, he's sound asleep, Morticia. It's unnecessary - He's gone. - Impossible. Well, the door was locked and there's no other way - There is another way. - Well, I certainly have no use for these. Please, I feel just as badly as you do about Gomez, but there's no need to carry on this way. Uncle Fester, really. Gomez must be having a real good night. Oh, Gomez darling, thank heaven you're home. Oh, dear. He's still asleep. He does more work asleep than he does when he's awake. Oh, that does it! This calls for drastic action. Lurch, now. Nothing like a nice morning shower. Me, the cat burglar? You stole all these things tonight. Yeah, and in exactly three hours and 20 minutes. - Not bad. - You do everything so well. There's only one way out. To return these things to their rightful owners. I told you he was an honest thief. There's only one small problem. I don't know who they belong to. That is a problem. Morticia, the police! - The perfect solution. - Jail? No. I'll just explain how this all happened, and they'll help us find the victims. - Capital idea. - No, it isn't. - They won't believe a word of it. Hide. - That's a better idea. Open up, in the name of the law! Open up the door. Open up. Lurch, let the gentlemen in. Well, we almost nabbed him, but he ducked down an alley. We got a good look at him, though. Fellow with a dark mustache and a goofy look. - We better look upstairs. - Oh, no. There's nothing up there but bats. Let the gentlemen come up if they'd like. It's all right, child. This is my grandfather, Alonzo Addams. Now what's all this nonsense about a cat burglar? Nonsense? These are lists of the houses they robbed and the items they took. - May I see that, please? - Please, lady, take my word for it. But I may be able to solve the case. Everybody's a detective. My granddaughter is the Sherlock Holmes of the Ladies' Literary League. Oh, yes. Elementary, my dear Watson. - Tish, that's French. - Grandfather, please. Feisty old gent, isn't he? That's an overgrown kid. Fastest shave I ever got. Looks kind of familiar, doesn't he, Sarge? - Very. - Please, gentlemen, let's not jump to conclusions. Can't blame a man for what he does in his sleep. We tried to stop him with psychic control. What's that? You know, the snake charmer and the snake. Psychic I'll show you. By george, you really put them to sleep. - I'll get the water. - No. Go upstairs and get the loot. Justice will be done at last. Well, that about does it. You will follow this list very carefully and give everything back to their rightful owners. Back to rightful owners. Almost forgot. As I always say, when you need help, call the police. It must be around here somewhere. I had it just last night. Did you lose something, darling? My new platinum ruby and diamond-studded wristwatch. - I left it on the hall table last night. - Oh, was that yours, Gomez? Yes. Have you seen it? I thought it was part of the loot. I put it back in the Sergeant's pocket. My $5,000 watch? I wonder who the Sergeant returned that to? Well, there's only one way to find out. Mama, cook up some more yak stew. Oh, no. 
Nice try, Gomez darling. Too good for you, huh, Lurch? Darling, I don't think you ought to tire Lurch out. You know how delicate he is. You may be right, my dear. He does look a bit spent. Well, Lurch. You had enough? Give up? Better luck next time, old man. Oh, Gomez, darling, you were so masterful. Delicious, like the nectar of saki. Mail's in. Yes, Thing. What is it? Oh, something at the door? Oh, it's my surprise for Cousin Itt. It's breathing. Hey, is that for me? No, Uncle Fester. This is a welcome-home surprise for Cousin Itt. Itt? I thought he was in the South Seas. He was, diving for sponges. Very successfully, too. The sponges thought he was one of them. Give me a hand, Fester. We have to get things ready for Cousin Itt's party. Now that's what I like. A package that delivers itself. Cousin Itt, are you sure your eyes are closed? - Good. - All right, Lurch. Now you can open your eyes, Cousin Itt. - I knew you'd like it, old man. - It's so you. - They look like brothers. - They do have a lot in common. What are you gonna name him, Cousin Itt? Which is the front end of Now I see. Mother, I'm hungry. Can we cut Cousin Itt's cake now? Of course, darling. I almost forgot about it. Cousin Itt, would you do the honors? Oh, of course. Lurch, we'll need a chair. You're welcome. All right, now, Cousin. Make a wish. I've heard of rock candy, but rock cake? Better try it again, dear. Oh, boy! That's my favorite, cauliflower meringue. What is it, Lurch? Is something wrong? Hair. Mother, look, there's hair on the chair, too. Cousin Itt, you're losing your hair. - He's right. Without his hair, what is he? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. No, no, no. Now, we will not have any of that do-it-away-with-yourself talk. That is, of course, unless we can't find a cure for you. Don't you worry. I'm an old hand at curing baldness. Cousin Itt, you're not leaving us? But you must give Uncle Fester a chance. But you're still very attractive. Wouldn't a little vacation be a lot more sensible? Now, Gomez and I have decided to give you a little extra money, say, $10,000. You could have yourself a real fling. Give it to charity? Just as you say, but please stay. Oh, I promise. We'd never call you Baldy. Dear, sweet, kind Cousin Itt. You know, a person could really talk to you. That's beautiful, my dear. It's beautiful. - What is it? - It's a sweater for Cousin Itt. If he's going to lose his hair, he has to have something to keep himself warm. Did the money cheer him up? He asked me to give it to the Society for the Prevention of Baldness. - Never heard of it. - Neither have I. But I asked Mrs. Dragwater to come over. She's the head of the welfare society. She'll see that it gets into the proper hands. Dear, would that be Mrs. Dragwater already? Good Good afternoon. I have a package here, sir. Could you get somebody to sign it for me, please? Follow me. - I didn't order anything, did you? - Perhaps it's for Cousin Itt. Is that my package? Yes, it is. It's my new chemistry set. I'm working on something to save Cousin Itt's hair. Well, will you sign for it? Thing, take care of that. Thanks. Now, a little electricity. Well, what do we have here? I've done it! Fester, you've done it! The first nonskid banana peel. Darling, I don't remember Aunt Anemia having a beard and a mustache. A beard, maybe, but not a mustache. It is becoming. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Thing, what's all this hair? Gomez, come here and look, dear. Curious. First, Aunt Anemia, now this box. This looks like a job for Sherlock Addams. Thank you. More hair. Darling Gomez, you're so clever. Elementary, cara mia, elementary. - Singular. - Very. A doorknob with a Beatle hairdo. - Well, what do you think? - Uncle Fester, I hardly knew you. - You're a knockout. - I made it with my new chemistry set. Have you tried the formula on Cousin Itt? Well, don't you think that one handsome devil in the family is enough? - Uncle Fester. - Well, okay. Cousin Itt! It's true. Blondes do have more fun. Eureka! Certainly, Cousin Itt. Take a look. By george, you do look like a haystack. But you should be flattered. Gomez doesn't hand out compliments like that to just everyone. - And congratulations to you, Uncle Fester. - Well, thank you, Morticia. You know, this could be the start of a whole new career for me. I could get a job at the zoo, growing hair on bald eagles. Oh, dear, that reminds me. That woman from the welfare society should be here any moment. Woman? Is she cute? I don't know, but she is a divorcée. Groovy. Carinita, we'll turn over the money to her for openers, and throw in Uncle Fester's discovery as a little bonus. Excellent idea, darling. Oh, Gomez, would you make the cocktails? You do them so well. It's that extra sprig of henbane. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? Boy! Am I that handsome? Wow! Yes. Mrs. Dragwater to see Mrs. Addams. Follow me. Mrs. Dragwater. Oh, Mrs. Dragwater, so good of you to come. My pleasure. My husband's upstairs napping. Won't you sit down? I think I'd better. Would you care for a cocktail? I think I'd better. You rang? Cocktails, please, Lurch. Yes, Mrs. Addams. Thank you, Lurch. You may go. Delicious, isn't it? It's my husband's piece de résistance. Creme de la toadstool. Tish! You spoke French. Darling, later, later. Mrs. Dragwater and I have a lot to discuss. Pardon me. So, now, where were we? Well, first, I ought to tell you, the welfare board supports a lot of charities. But we don't exactly have a Society for the Prevention of Baldness. However Well, now, who's our charming guest? Mrs. Dragwater, this is my Uncle Fester. How do you do? Excuse me. Well, haven't we met before? Such a delicate little hand. And tasty, too. Mrs. Addams, your uncle is so droll. Yes, he does have that Continental manner, doesn't he? With a beauty like you, who could be otherwise? Now, really. I know that Emily Post says to wait one week, but how about you and me stepping out tonight? Skateboarding, water polo, a drive-in movie that's closed. - Well - It's a date. I'll borrow Mama's motor scooter. You are a forceful one. Experience, experience. Well, I think I'll go up and pomade my hair. If anybody wants me, I'll be in my room. Tonight at 8:00. Mrs - Mrs. Dragwater? - Yes? Mrs. Dragwater? - Ready? - Ready. Do it again. Querida, you have such a gentle, healing touch. Was Mrs. Dragwater pleased with our offer? Well, I don't know. There she was, smiling and pleasant, and then all of a sudden, there she wasn't. Those social workers have to keep on the move. Morticia, look. Oh, darling, she's lost her beard and mustache. Too bad. I liked her better that way. - Gomez, the turtle. - Great Scott! - Did you hear that? Cousin Itt. - Cousin Itt. Cousin Itt, what happened? Gad, even your voice has changed! Excuse me, old man. - Itt, what happened? - Have you lost your lovely new hair? You mean, Uncle Fester's lotion was only temporary? You weren't losing your hair? By george, Morticia. Cousin Itt's right. It was the dog. That's terrible. Who ever heard of a bald dog? Don't worry, dear. If worse comes to worse, we'll get you a toupee. Come in. Uncle Fester lost his hair again. How is he taking it? Good old Fester, tower of strength. Lurch, look out here, will you please Fester. Watch out for that beam. Now, he tells me. - Uncle Fester, did you hurt yourself? - Just my head. This room is a deathtrap! But it does give you a sense of togetherness. Did I really lose my hair? Well, I didn't misplace it. Uncle Fester. All you have to do is give yourself another treatment. It'll only work once. And my head is immune to it. I'm gonna shoot myself. Come, come, Fester. Pull yourself together. Thanks, Gomez. I needed that. Phone's ringing. Lurch, answer the phone, please. - The phone! - Where's the phone? Maybe it's under the bed. Stop that bongo playing, will you? We're looking for the phone. I think he means it's under the drum. Oh, yes. Hello, Addams residence. Yes, just a moment. It's for you, Uncle Fester. Mrs. Dragwater. I'm gonna shoot myself. You better talk to her first. Not without my hair. I'm not in. I'm not in! Mrs. Dragwater, Uncle Fester is out. I'll take a message. Yes. Yes. Oh, of course. Really? Yes, I will. Thank you. Goodbye. I know she called the date off. Now, now, Uncle Fester, she merely called to explain that she was afraid sooner or later she'd lose a Don Juan like you to some other woman. Did she call me a Don Juan? What else, you sly old fox? How true. Mrs. Dragwater averted heartbreak by going back to her husband. Her husband? Rover T. Dragwater? I know him. He's fat, bald, and has a high, squeaky voice. - Well, if that's her taste - So it all worked out for the best. - Let's celebrate. - No, I'm too broken up. Even for a midnight picnic? In the swamp? Afterwards, if we have time, we could go moonbathing. Moonbathing! Well, what are we waiting for? Everybody watch that beam. And the door. Ah, what a perfect night for moonbathing. By george, what a beautiful moon. Not a sign of life. Nothing but solid rock. Gomez, that's Uncle Fester's head. It is? - What's it doing up in the sky? - Gomez! Pardon. No wonder it looked like a rock. This spray is no good. It doesn't attract any insects. Don't worry, Cousin Itt will bring them around. Hey, Itt, you're doing pretty good with that balancing act. He should. He's been taking lessons from Pugsley's seal. It pays. Glad you got over your hair problem, Cousin Itt. I'm sorry your dog still has it. Dog? Oh, that reminds me, Cousin Itt. Where is your dog? Your dog eloped? With Mrs. Dragwater? With her dog. Oh, isn't that lovely? Eloped with a Mexican hairless. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Hungry? Picture in domestic tranquility. Hemlock on the hearth, and my lovely wife feeding the piranha. Next to you-know-what, they like pickled herring the best. Good little eaters, aren't they? Next to Kitty cat they're the best eaters in the house. Oh, dear. Morticia, Gomez. Kitty cat didn't eat his dinner and he's acting so strangely. See? No pep, no energy. Poor dear does look a bit under. I tried everything to cheer him up. I even stuck my head in his mouth up to there. If that didn't cheer him up He's been making friends with that alley cat next door. Scrunchy little thing, but maybe he wants a friend who's a cat. Any kind of a cat. Mama, you are so wise. Kitty cat is of an age to marry and have a family. Darling, why don't we send to Africa for a mate? Send? Send? Querida, suppose I had just received you in the mail instead of stalking you as I did? Morticia. Those runs we had through Hurricane Dora. By the time Typhoon Terry came, we were engaged. Kitty cat must have the same chance. Yes, darling. You rang? Lurch, begin preparations for a safari. I'll tell the children. A safari! Is it true we're going to visit the happy hunting ground? Yes, we're taking Kitty cat wife-shopping. Well, let's get wives for everybody. I'm ready. You needn't go to Africa for yours, old man. Oh, yes. All the local girls have turned me down. I can't imagine why. Well, it's when I tell them I sleep on a bed of nails. American girls just don't seem to like that. True femininity is disappearing. Darling, why don't I cable the white hunter and tell him to expect us? Excellent idea, my dear. Tell him accommodations for seven people, one lion, one alligator, one octopus and one spider. Better forget the spider. I like to travel light. Yes, bwana. When you call me bwana, my blood boils. And how I love the sound. - Did it come through? - No, Uncle Fester. Bravo, querida. - Try this one. - What's this one, dear? It's what the Batulu tribe calls a kitku, or a far-carrying spear. They use it against distant relatives. - What's the number? - That's the area code. Very good. What's this one, darling? I believe that's a mashu klift. A spear of great accuracy designed for use against tsetse flies. - Oh, dear, that bell's out of order again. - No problem. You rang? Lurch, a tsetse fly, please. Ready? Release. Perfect hit. - What? - What? You mean, you think Kitty cat may just have a cold? By george, it never occurred to me. Of course, it could be as simple as that. Merely a case for the family doctor. Family witch doctor, of course. Well, to the telephone, my dear. Do you remember Dr. Mbogo's number in Africa? Zulu 854. Oh, yes. Thank you, my dear. Person-to-person call to Dr. Mbogo in Africa. Zulu What? First name? Just a moment. - You remember Dr. Mbogo's first name? - Mbogo. Oh, yes, of course. Mbogo. I can never remember that. Dr. Mbogo Mbogo, please. Who did you want again? Oh, Dr. Mbogo. Wait a minute. I'll see if I can get a hold of him. Hold on. We'll have to get ourselves a hollow log. We'd save a lot of time by dialing direct. Hello, Dr. Mbogo? Gomez Addams here. How are you, Doctor? Oh, that's too bad. Well, we have a little problem here ourselves. Kitty cat. Seems to be suffering from lack of appetite. Yes. Take three hairs from a wildebeest. Mix with boiling water. Burn down the hut? I think the doctor had better come out and have a look. Absolutely. Doctor, I think you'd better come out and examine him personally. Come on, Doctor, you ought to be used to that by now. That's your final word, eh? Well, as long as you feel that way. - He refuses to come out and see Kitty cat. - Refuses to see him? Seems Kitty cat's father ate his father. Well, you rustle up boiling water and some matches, and I'll go hunt up a wildebeest. Darling, where are we going to find a wildebeest this time of year? I think I saw one lurking in Mama's room. Leave it to Mama. I'll help you trap it. But first, to the library for a little target practice. Darling. Cousin Itt, would you help us with the target practice, please? - Ready? - Ready. You're getting warmer, darling. Try it again. Now, up to Mama's room and that wildebeest. What? It isn't a wildebeest, it's Mama? Well, that lets out Dr. Mbogo. Darling, I do believe Thing is right. Why don't we call a veterinarian? Well, a veterinarian isn't as scientifically advanced as Dr. Mbogo, but I guess we have no choice. This one sounds rather reliable. "AAAAA Animal Doctors. For the pet who has everything. " AAAAAA Animal Doctors. Gunderson speaking. The health of your pet is our A-1 concern. Are you calling in reference to a bird, dog or cat? A cat. Now, what are your cat's symptoms? Well, he seems to have no appetite at all. He hasn't eaten since yesterday, and then all he had was a leg of yak, some marinated cheetah and a soufflé of aardvark. cheetah, soufflé of Sorry, there's something wrong with my phone. Would you repeat that, please? Yak, cheetah and a soufflé of aardvark. What did you say your cat ate? Leg of yak, some marinated cheetah, and a soufflé of aardvark. I'd better come right over. Yeah. Dr. Gunderson. Glad you could make it, Doctor. Gomez Addams here. - Nice to see you. - Mrs. Addams there. - How do you do? - How do you do? I do hope you can help Kitty cat. We couldn't even tempt him with broiled elephant hooves. Your cat likes broiled elephant hooves? Doesn't everyone? I'm going to lead you to the patient, Doctor, you must be very busy. Well, only in the molting season. You know Oh, I see the doctor finally got here. Well, go to it, but don't make a federal case out of it. Our family doctor could've cured him like that, but we didn't want to burn down the hut. We've grown rather attached to it. Your family doctor prescribed burning down the hut? Well, some of his methods are a trifle extreme. Well, does your family doctor think that maybe your cat has something highly infectious? No. I think Dr. Mbogo just enjoys a good fire. Some of the doctor's medical theories may be questionable, but he is absolutely great on curses. - Curses? - A specialist. This way, please. This is Kitty cat's favorite room. He really preferred the tree house, but there just isn't room for both of us. He's probably in the tunnel. Perhaps this will bring him out. He loves to play circus. Kitty cat, come on out. The doctor's here. That's Kitty cat? He's such an obedient little darling. - I think he likes you. - Likes me? That's what I was afraid of. But, Doctor, don't you want to examine him? Oh, no, I would not like to examine him. I think the doctor wants to be alone with him. - No. No, I don't want to be. - Very well. We'll stand by you. - Anything we can do for you? - Yes, you can get me out of here, - because I - But Kitty cat needs you. Oh, no. You see, I don't know anything about lions. You see, I'm really a bird man. Honest. I flunked wild beasts twice. You're my kind of people. I flunked everything twice. Also, I'm a coward. What's there to be afraid of? Doctor, I think we're inhibiting you. We'll go and you stay. Oh, no. I'll go, you stay. Come on now, Doctor. I know you can help Kitty cat. Look at those gentle healing hands. Now, do be sweet to him. He's such a shy, sensitive thing. - Don't go. Wait a second. - Doctor. Fellows. If there's anything you want, just yell. Help! Well, he doesn't have to yell that loud. No, Uncle Fester, let's not indulge the doctor. Well, I agree with you, but I don't know what you mean. Didn't it strike you as strange that a veterinarian should be afraid of a harmless, little animal like Kitty cat? By george, I think he was afraid. You are a discerning one. Poor man. He needs help much more than Kitty cat. The only sensible thing to do is to call Dr. Mbogo again. No, let's work on Dr. Gunderson. You know, build up his ego, restore his confidence. Capital idea. How? Well, let him work on members of the family. Make him think he's effected miracle cures. - You know, put on a little act. - Clever. But unnecessary. They're getting along just fine. Just as I thought. The doctor seems to have everything under control. The doctor's playing dead. I think he is dead. - Am I dead? - Certainly not. But appearances are deceiving. Look, maybe you better get your family doctor. It may not be such a bad idea burning down this hut. We have faith in you. Oh, no. I'm a quack. I'm a fraud. I told you he was our kind of people. As a matter of fact, we'd like to have you look at another patient. - Another lion? - No. A Gila monster? A man-eating shark? - One of the family. - But you were close. Oh, no, no. You see, I don't have a license to treat humans. Oh, you can treat Cousin Itt. - You wanna watch that low bridge. - Yes, I have to. Here's the patient, Doctor. - What is it? - Good question. That's our Cousin Itt. Tell the doctor what's troubling you, darling. That's it in a nutshell. But I didn't understand a word. He's in your hands, Doctor. Oh, no, I don't He could - Does he bite? - Certainly not. Although he does bark a bit. Are you sure you wouldn't rather burn the place down? No, Dr. Mbogo's methods are far too advanced. We prefer the old-fashioned remedy. It's the same all over. That's Cousin Itt. All heart. I didn't hear anything. Oh, dear. It's worse than I thought. I'd better take his temperature. Bull's-eye! Well, at least we know his appetite's good. - He loves thermometers. - Real sweet tooth. Please. All you have to do is spread a little kerosene and light a match Nonsense, Doctor, you're doing splendidly. Cousin Itt looks better already. At least he's got his color back. How do you feel, Cousin Itt? You see, he's a completely new man. And anything is an improvement. You're not a doctor, you're a miracle worker. Can I go now? Not until you look in on Cleopatra. Cleopatra? Does she eat thermometers, too? No, but she's a glutton for tongue depressors. Here's your patient, Doctor. Where? Cleopatra, say hello to the nice doctor. It's choking me. Nonsense, Doctor, that's love at first sight. You have a wonderful plant-side manner. Come here, Cleopatra, darling. Come here, baby. Yes, there's Mother's baby. Let the doctor examine you. Did you ever see a more piqued-Iooking African strangler? Poor thing. She's just lost all desire to strangle. No, she hasn't. No, she hasn't. You see? Oh, dear. Well, are you going to examine her? - Of course he will. - Of course I will, yes. Well, Doctor, what is it? The plant needs watering. Why didn't I think of that? By george, that's an excellent diagnosis. Doctor, how can we ever repay you? By letting me out of here. Of course. As soon as you have a look at Uncle Fester. Uncle Fester. Hurry, Doctor, before we lose him. What seems to be the trouble? I'm sick. That's a death rattle if I ever heard one. First thing we have to do is get him on a comfortable bed. What could possibly be more comfortable than the bed he's on? Excuse us a moment. - Maybe he is a quack. - Oh, no, darling, I think he's just nervous. Uncle Fester is giving a magnificent performance. Reminds me of Edwin Booth Addams. - When he made theatrical history? - When he died. Oh, yes. Well, Doctor, what have you discovered? My watch stopped. Uncle Fester does seem to have passed the crisis, though. No, I haven't. Of course you have, Fester. The doctor has remarkable healing power. Don't tell me, I'm the patient. It's the end. Will you excuse us, please? Darling. Uncle Fester seems to be overdoing it a bit. A real ham. What do we do? Maybe we ought to let the doctor lose one. Wouldn't be a bad average. No, the doctor might have a relapse. Good thinking. Well, Doc, the only thing you can do now is operate. - Never. - Why not? Can't stand the sight of blood. Just a moment, please. The doctor's slipping faster than Fester. Yes, we may be witnessing medical history in the making. The first time a patient ever loses a doctor. We've gotta make Fester take a turn for the better. Now. - How? - Good question. I wish I knew the answer. I have it. Doctor, I'm afraid you're not the man for this case. Oh, I'm not. I'm not. Uncle Fester doesn't need a doctor. He needs an undertaker. Wait a minute. I'm not dead yet. You will be by the time he gets here. The undertaker will be right here. Wait a minute! I just had a big comeback. Yes, a comeback. Congratulations, Doctor, you've done it again. - Done what? - Such modesty. You've just snatched this man from the jaws of death. I did? You're the Albert Schweitzer of veterinarians. Doctor, how can I ever repay you? I keep telling you, by letting me get out of here. I know the whole world is clamoring for your services, and you must answer that call. Right after you have a look at Thing. Thing? Who's Thing? Not who, Doctor, but what. Thing, come out. The doctor's here. Well, Doctor, he's in Boy, he was in a hurry. Poor devil. Didn't even wait for his fee. Strange, strange man. Thank you for trying, Thing. Morticia, Gomez. - Kitty take a turn for the worse? - Oh, he's all better. By george, that doctor is a genius. Well, Kitty wasn't even sick. Wasn't sick? But he didn't eat a morsel of food. Well, that's because Pugsley had already fed him. Well, it all was for the best. - It was? - Of course. We helped restore the doctor's confidence. Love those duets. Such melodic instruments, darling. Morticia, Gomez. - What is it, Mama? - Now Kitty cat is sick. Are you sure? She's sure. He ate that second meal we put out for him. It was too much. Now he's got a stomachache. Oh, dear. Well, there's only one thing to do. - Call Dr. Gunderson. - Exactly. Thank you. Thank you, Thing. You know, this should be a lesson to all of us. Gluttony is Hello, is Dr. Gunderson there, please? Morticia Addams calling. Thank you very much. - They say the doctor's gone off to Africa. - Africa? Of course. He went to work with Dr. Mbogo. Now this, dear. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Thank you, Thing. Not bad for a beginner. Look who my teacher is. That's true! But remember in the future, my dear, follow through! Follow through! Mother, can we go out and play? In this weather? With all that blue sky and sunshine? We've been in for two weeks now. And there's nothing left to do. I know just the thing! How would you children like to come down to the moat and watch me wrestle with the alligator? - In the quicksand. - In the quicksand? Oh, goody! Oh, yes! I see what I've been doing wrong. Oh, thank you, Thing. - Gomez. - Yes, my dear. I'm concerned about the children. I know! But every silver lining has its cloud. And with all of us cooped up here on account of the elements, it's bound to get a bit sticky. Oh, no, darling. That isn't exactly what I meant. You know, I thought Uncle Fester was spoiling them, but Mama is even worse. She lets them sit on her back in the morning when she does her pushups, she's told them where I keep the yak fudge, and I know she's letting Pugsley sleep with his tarantula. I'm going to speak to her! But gently, Morticia, gently. Of course. I threw him in 12 seconds flat. And she's gonna do it again this afternoon. With one hand tied. Mama, that's the fourth time this week. Don't worry. I'm in good shape. I'm gonna work out again on my trampoline. It's the children we're concerned about, Mama. You probably don't realize it, but you're being much too indulgent. Besides, you're wearing out the poor alligator. And you're shedding crocodile tears. Pish tosh! And I think she means it. Oh, blue skies again! Oh, those dreadful petals getting larger and larger, and my poor thorns just wilting away. Great game, polo! I may donate a field to the orphanage. On your way, Kelso. Good shot, darling. The door. Sounds like a wild beast. Optimist! Whoa! Gomez, is it really you? Maybe not. I haven't been myself lately. Morticia! Thank you. Am I really home? Doesn't it look like it, dear? I don't know. Those blue skies, all that sunshine. It's done something to my mind. I thought I was home twice already this afternoon. Both times it turned out to be a mirage. Whee! Thank goodness. This time it's real. Mama just can't seem to stay on that trampoline. Uncle Fester, what ever possessed you to go out on a day like this? I had no choice. There wasn't a single stick left in the whole house. And you know they don't deliver on weekends. Couldn't it have waited till Monday? What? Wait three whole days without an explosion? How are you going to explain that to a child? Uncle Fester, don't you think you've been indulging them a bit too much? Fester, my parents were rich, but when I was a boy, I sold newspapers, collected bottles, scrimped and saved my kopeks, so that I could buy one single stick of 40% nitro. Now, that's how you build character. But it makes them so happy. Uncle Fester, a happy child is merely an unhappy child who's having fun. For their sakes, I'll take care of this for a while. But that's my dynamite. I paid for it with my blood, sweat, and my alligator egg money. Uncle Fester, please try and understand. We don't want you and Mama spoiling the children. Well, I don't call the bare necessities of life spoiling them. All right. I'll be up in my closet sulking. Kind of dark in there. I don't think we were unreasonable. Do you? Oh, of course not, darling. You know he loves to pout. It keeps his battery charged. You rang? Yes, Lurch. Would you Darling. Where should we store Uncle Fester's dynamite? That little shelf right above the furnace should be perfect. As for the weather, this part of the country will remain unchanged. - Fair. - Clear. - Sunny. - Maddening! Meanwhile, the Gulf Coast states are bracing themselves for the arrival of hurricane Zsa Zsa. Hurricane Zsa Zsa. Oh, Gomez. It makes me go all tingly all over just to think about it. If we hurry, we can drive down and catch it. Divine. Oh, no. It isn't. Darling, we can't go. The children are in school. And we couldn't leave them with Uncle Fester and Mama. It would be such an imposition. True. We won't have to. I'll engage a governess. You're always at your best in a crisis. You're so inspiring. That's what they said about Old Ebenezer Addams. When he led the early settlers across the great plains? When he sold the first guns to the Indians. He really was a pioneer. I'm going to engage a governess. This is Mrs. Addams, over on Cemetery Ridge. I'd like to engage a governess for a week or two. Oh? Just a moment. They have a Miss Thudd. She speaks Choctaw like a native and holds a white hunter's license. Sounds like a gem. Miss Thudd will be acceptable. A hundred dollars? Sounds like a steal. A hundred dollars seems a bit high. After all, we do have a butler to take care of the alligator in the basement. Yes. Alligator. All she'd have to do is supervise the children and a few African stranglers. She'd see that their food is well cooked and that they brush after every meal. No, not the children, the stranglers. Two hundred dollars? Very well, we'll take it. I kept her from going to three. That's what I call horse trading. Zsa Zsa, here we come. One thing about traveling light, it doesn't take you long to pack. Tish. You sentimental little dickens. I wore it at our first hurricane. They'll be gone a whole week. It shows that they really do count on us. I fixed them a snack for the road. You better take it to them before it stiffens. That's beautiful. You know what? I like it the way they trust us with the children. It gets me right here. Oh? Oh? Oh. Well, thank you very much for calling. Gomez. The governess can't be here until tomorrow. Oh, well. We'll just have to miss the first day of the big blow. If you've seen them sandbag one lobby, you've seen them all. I don't like the sound of that cough. And we don't like the sound of what Lurch just told us. Yeah, the truth is finally out. You don't trust us with the children. You think we're too feeble and too old and too unreliable. And too shiftless and too low-down and too uncouth and - Fester! - I was carried away. Oh, my dears, we simply didn't want to burden you with the responsibility. See? You heard it from her own lips. - We're not responsible. - Don't be foolish. Now we're foolish, too. Let's clear out. All right, we're gonna go pack up our money and my light bulb. Gomez, darling, stop them. Don't worry, my dear. They're obviously bluffing about leaving. They're merely children, and from time to time, need mature, sensible guidance. We're not helpless. Imagine a governess in our house. Fester! You know the combination of that safe. How many times do I have to tell you? It's so much more fun cracking it. My. The things that come out of a nest egg! That little fellow must be hungry. Fester, I just remembered. There's no money in there. Something better than money. The great Star of the East. Oh, yes! The sacred ruby that Great-Grandfather Blob pried from the head of the Hindu idol. Not pried from the head of a Hindu idol, pried from the head of a Hindu. It was giving him a terrible headache, and he was so relieved, he gave Great-Grandpapa a present of the ruby. Gone. - Burglars? - Couldn't be. Why would they take just that and leave the rest of these valuables? Let me take a peek. Remember? Oh, yeah! That cat that yowled half the night. Well, it was the only rock in the house. That's that. Now we gotta stay home. We'll do the next best thing. Now, they'll stay on their side and, since we're not needed, we'll stay over here. One thing, this whole business is so outlandish, it can't last. We'll keep it just this way from now on. I should have thought of this 20 years ago. Well, we might as well have lunch. You rang? Hey, here's a hot one. Good-as-new rickshaw, never been on a freeway, only $98. See Slippery Sam, the honest Chinaman. I'd have to see that first. - We got gypped the last time. - Yeah. Oh, Lurch. Ask Mr. Addams if I can see the sports page please. And if Mrs. Addams doesn't mind, I'd like fashions. Sports page. See if you can get the want ads. That rickshaw sounds like a steal. Lurch, I'd like theater and arts when Mama is through. - I heard him. - I did, too. Thank you, Lurch. Thank you. By george! Here's an interesting want ad. The ladies skirts will be longer this year. Lurch, you gave me the sports page. And I've got finance. Yeah, and I'm stuck with the news. I got finance again. He gave me the society page. Schwarzkopf pitches no-hitter! Not bad for a rickshaw boy. Am I back to sports again? Appears to be. I'm in want ads. Lurch, you gave me real estate. And I certainly don't need beauty hints. Oh, that must be the new governess. Better answer the door, Lurch. I am the new governess. Follow me. That throat needs tending. Definitely! Wait here. Ah, Miss Thudd. Just call me Thudd. We hope you'll like it here, Thudd. I like the house. It is nice and homey, isn't it? Cheerful, too. I think it would be even cheerier if we put up a few more family pictures. Oh, darling, it would be too much with that. Oh, of course. Cousin Nanook's family. Won't you sit down? I prefer to stand. Ah, children. This is Wednesday and Pugsley, our children. Darlings, this is your new governess, Thudd. My guillotine's busted. "Broken," not "busted. " Well, either way, we can't make it work. You must think positively. Keep repeating firmly to yourself, "My guillotine will work. My guillotine will work. "My guillotine will work. " I like her attitude. She's our kind of people. Well, you're in complete charge, Thudd. Follow me. Run along, children. Have fun! Did you ever see happier expressions on children's faces? Thudd does have winning ways. We refuse to remain under the same roof with her. Right. We're leaving. But you haven't any money. We have something better than money. We have the old Addams ingenuity. I can get a job as carhop. Or, better still, an airline hostess. And I can always go back to testing skateboards or I may take a whack at brain surgery. Come, Mama, the world is waiting. They may be naive and misguided but, by Jove, they're glorious. You rang? Yes, Lurch, please put our luggage in the car. Every now and then, there's a bear gets in here. Mean devil. Well, who knows? We may have an indoor hurricane. Oh, Gomez, it's exactly as I remembered it. Divine. You're the first customers we've had here since you was here two years ago. Gomez, darling. Look! So, that's where you left it. I'm coming to think there's something wrong with this place. Maybe the location. Nonsense. The location is ideal. Why, the vinegar works are over there, glue factory is right behind you. Gomez, darling. That thunder is like music to my ears. Folks, we're trying a new policy. Free Continental breakfast. Obviously catering to the jet set. Nope, we got to use up the eggs. A flock of hens been nesting in number six. Here's your key. Oh, one other little thing. Watch out for the badger trap under the bed. What a divine touch. Stick with me, Tish. First class, all the way. Morticia! You, a night, and a swamp. Gomez, darling. Why don't we get into something more comfortable? Capital suggestion! Fair warning, querida. I'm coming out with that new cologne, Deadwood number five. Gomez. Gomez, come here, quick. Quickly. Quickly! Hurry! Hurry, Gomez! Oh, no, no, no, darling. The suitcase. Look. Thudd's! Lurch obviously gave me this one by mistake. Certainly looks that way. Vitamins? This Thudd seems more like a dud. Look at this. Mother Goose, and Sugar plums. Oatmeal cookies, lollypops An apple. That women's a fraud. Well, she can't be all bad. Really? Reading Dr. Spock? Oh, I thought it was Dr. Spook. Gomez, how could we have been taken in by a pretty face and a little charm. - We must go back. - Let's hope we're not too late. - Lurch! - Lurch, open up. Oh, dear. Lurch, is everything all right? Wednesday? Pugsley? Children? Pugsley? Wednesday? Lurch, what happened? Oh, dear! Gomez. Gomez, I'm afraid we're too late. Better let me check first, my dear. So The honeymooners are back. Did you enjoy your hurricane? Fester, Mama. What are you doing here? - Our duty. - Unlike some people I know. We couldn't leave the children in the hands of that fiend. So, we swallowed our pride, came back and fired her. I think she's on her way to join the Peace Corps. Thank goodness! Well, since we are not needed here, I can just about make the swing shift at the skateboard factory. I have to get back to the drive-in. Uncle Fester, Mama, please stay. We love you and the children need you. Besides, the old place wouldn't be the same without you. Well, I'll stay, but on one condition. The sky's the limit. I'm a grown man. And a fine, intelligent one. I can't be treated like a child. No grown man should be treated like a child. So, I want my dynamite back. That's a deal. Goody. For a moment there, I thought he was gonna ask for something silly. Something silly? Uncle Fester? Oh, it's such a comfort to know that the children are back in good hands. - Cara. - Darling. - Good shot, Thing. - Good shot, Thing. It's wonderful having everybody back together again, isn't it? Yes, but I am a little sorry about missing hurricane Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa! Everybody outside. You and I can go up to the attic. The attic? I know how sentimental you are about the Last Chance Motel. I tore a big hole in the roof. Darling 
Gomez, darling, I finally got it. - That wonderful glint in your eye. - Bravo, Morticia. Bravo, Gomez. That was a lovely cast, dear. It's all in the snap of the wrist, my dear. By george, I believe I really did snap it. - Pick a card, Father. Any card. - Later, Son. I believe I've got a nibble. Yes, I'd say so. Mother, you pick a card. Play it, dear, the way you play the strings of my heart. Tish, when you croon soft and low like that - Darling, I'm crooning about the fish. - Oh, that. - Mother, you didn't even look at it. - Oh, I'm sorry, dear. - It was the ace of diamonds. - I'm supposed to tell you that. Go play with Wednesday, sweetheart. - Pick a card. - Oh, you and your silly old card tricks. They're all ace of diamonds. See? - Checkmate, Thing. - Aw, heck. Thing. Thing. Pick a card, Thing. Any card. Everybody tries to get in on the act. Lurch, the net. Steady Now! I wondered what happened to that. Strangest fish I ever saw. - Darling, it's Mama's dress shoe. - Ah. So it is. Still, it's the biggest thing I ever caught. Two pounds if it's an ounce. An indoor record. Hi. Where'd you come from? I used to have a friend like you. Gorgo. Did he send you? Yes, he did. Do you like card tricks? I got two of the same kind for my birthday. Like it, huh? Okay, it's yours. I'd sure like to try this card trick on someone. Uncle Fester! I'll be right back. "Next, pinch of gizzard from a wizard. "Powdered bat's wings boiled in oil. " Pick a card, Uncle Fester. Any card. How many times have I told you? Not while I'm conjuring. Gee, I'm sorry. Who are you going to conjure? Oh, I don't know, it was a surprise package deal I got from my Spell-of-the-Month Club. Look, if you don't mind, I'd like to get on with my conjuring, if you please? "Tooth of unicorn. "Twelve newt's eyes. "Season to taste, and here's the surprise. " You all right, Pugsley? I must have used stale newt's eyes. Where are you, Pugsley? Say, have you Pugsley? Oh, boy, talk about a surprise. Wait till I spread the word about this. Morticia, Gomez! Oh, boy! Super Ape. The Space Detective. The Green A venger. Mr. And Mrs. Addams, may I present your son, Pugsley. Pugsley? That? - D-R-U-N-K. - I tell you, it's true. It happened I was running though a little black magic and one minute standing there was a fat little boy, and then, poof! That. Uncle Fester, I think you've been working too hard on your magic tricks. Morticia, Fester may be right. These are Pugsley's cards. This is Pugsley's shirt. I absolutely refuse to believe that that Gomez, look. He has that same lovely low brow as you-know-who. Yeah, and that same fine prehistoric jaw line. Oh, it is Pugsley. I'd know that voice anywhere. Oh, Pugsley, my boy, what has Uncle Fester done to you? No, don't get worried, Morticia. I'll change him back if you want me to. If we want you to. If we want him to. - We do want him to, don't we? - Absolutely. Pugsley promised me he'd water the crab grass, and he's not getting out of it so easily. Don't look so downcast, old man. It was an excellent job of conjuring. He's a fine-Iooking chimp. It was a nice spell, wasn't it? - A regular tour de force. - Tish That French ripples from your lips. - It inflames me. - Darling, please, not in front of our son. Sorry, I got carried away. - Well, I'll go back to my fishing. - Darling. Mama, guess what? No time for riddles. I'm cooking gopher goulash for dinner, and I'll tell you, it's more trouble than it's worth. I can't find half the things I need. Mama, look. - Might be just the touch it needs. - No! Mama! - That's Pugsley. - Pugsley? I thought there was a resemblance. I cast a spell on him. Beginner's luck, if you ask me. There'll be no living with him from now on, I suppose. Now, please don't dawdle in changing Pugsley back. He has homework to do, too. You might as well save your breath. You heard your mother. You've got work to do. Now let's see. Purée of aardvark. No condemned prisoner ever ate a heartier meal. Darling Gomez. You'd better set another place for Pugsley. Uncle Fester, I distinctly told you that I wanted Pugsley changed back. I know, I tried, I tried, but Set another place. Uncle Fester, whatever happened to that wonderful combination of magically proven ingredients? Well, the powdered rhinoceros horn I'm using may have turned a little rancid. Excuses, excuses. Like I said before, beginner's luck. Now, you're not being very kind, Mama. Uncle Fester will change Pugsley back right after lunch, won't you, old boy? You're darn right I will. In fact, I'll do it right now. No, no, Uncle Fester, I won't have you conjuring on an empty stomach. After lunch. Lurch, please give Pugsley his lunch. A coconut. Come on, Pugsley. Now from here on in, all I want is complete silence. It won't take long to change Pugsley back, will it, Uncle Fester? Three shakes of a yak's tail. "Viper's head. "Tail of donkey. "Pugsley's changed from boy to monkey. "Down and up, through field and fen. "Change, oh, change him back again. " - Pugsley! - My boy. Pugsley. - Pugsley, speak to your mother. - Allow me, querida. Yes, dear. Pugsley? No, it can't be. Pugsley has more hair. Then where There you are. You naughty little boy. Teasing your Uncle Fester like that. Now, you may as well know. I have been in touch with the spirits. Oh, well, a little drink now and then never hurt anyone. The spirits of the astral plane, I'm talking about. One of those champagne flights, eh, Fester? Very funny. All I can say is when this séance is over, a little boy will have been restored to a mother's yearning bosom. A little boy monkey, you mean. I'm getting certain hostile vibrations which I will try to ignore. Now, if you will all please join hands. Now, I'm gonna ask everyone to concentrate. Concentrate. Gomez, do you mind concentrating on something else just this once? Sorry, Fester, force of habit. Now concentrate. Concentrate. Oh, spirits of the astral plane, give us a sign. Is Pugsley there? Rap once for yes and twice for no. And ask him if he's all right. Your mother wants to know if you're all right. Rap three times for yes and four times for no. No, you better make that twice for yes and three times for no. - Now, now, relax, everybody. - Great going, Fester. You're zeroing in on Pugsley. Oh, my little boy, out there whistling in the dark somewhere. Now everybody quiet down. Is that you, Pugsley? Whistle once and rap twice for yes. Rap once and whistle three times for no. Five raps? What does that mean? That means it's definitely Pugsley. He never could count. Oh, my little boy, rapping away in the dark somewhere. Well, now, take it easy, Pugsley, old boy. Are you all right? Rap once and whistle twice for yes. And rap twice and whistle three times for no. - Help! - It's him. No doubt. No one else puts so much into a screech. Keep screeching, darling. Uncle Fester's trying to pierce that nasty old astral veil. A-OK, Pugsley, old boy. We're reading you loud and clear. Now listen, pal. We want you to materialize back onto our astral plane. Understand? What kind of plane? Stand clear, Thing. - A message from Pugsley. - Airmail. But why didn't he come himself? - He can't make it. - Nonsense, my dear, it's nothing more - Great Scott! This is serious. - I knew it. Tell me. No, don't tell me. Yes, do tell me. I must know the worst. The Green Avenger's being threatened by the Manusian Zarock's deadly zeta beam radiation. The only form of energy that can penetrate his plastic screen. Dear, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it, Thing? Something we should know? Is it smaller than a coffin? Larger than a tsetse fly? Is it the title of a song? This is fun. I mean it would be if Pugsley were here. Is it someone we know? How many syllables? Two syllables. Whom do we know with two syllables? First syllable. Sounds like Fight? Fighting? Fighter? Pugilist. Pug! Pug, Pug Just doesn't seem to ring a bell. This is a difficult one, isn't it? Well, I'm trying to bring back Pugsley and you're playing games. - That's it, Pugsley! - By george, Morticia, you're right. Pugsley, my boy, oh, my darling. Am I glad to see you. Looks like we've got twins. Let there be dancing in the street. Our son has been restored to us. Thanks to our Uncle Uncle Fester? Help! Help! Uncle Fester, we can hear you, but faintly. Can you hear us? Scream once for yes and twice for no. Better make that one scream and two raps for no, and two screams and one whistle for yes. Forget it. By george, I was right. My Great-Aunt Deliria was engaged to a chimpanzee. Here they are. - Lovely couple. - Too bad he jilted her. Too bad our little chimp had to go back to its owner. It was nice, having him climb all over the place. Uncle Fester hasn't stopped eating since he clawed his way out of that secret room. Well, three days without food does tend to sharpen one's appetite. I wonder if there are any other rooms we've forgotten about. It's lovely. What is it? Wednesday claims she has a new boyfriend. The Invisible Man's son, Woodrow. The little minx. They grow up before you know it. Not only that, she made me promise to knit a pair of gloves for him, for his birthday. Marvelous. I'm sorry you can't stay for dinner, Woodrow. Maybe next time. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I wasn't looking where I was going. Yes. - Well, goodbye, Woodrow. - Goodbye, Wednesday. See you tomorrow. I'd better get busy on these gloves. 
Oh, you tempestuous Latins. I think you made me drop a stitch. I'm sure Cousin Plato wouldn't mind. - What are you fashioning for the lad? - A ski cap. - Do you think he'll like it? - How could he help it? When you block it, remember old Plato's left head is size six and his right one is eight and three quarters. Yes, it does give him a lovely tilt. - Uncle Fester, dear, is something wrong? - Plenty. What's the matter, old man? Every time you come back from town, you're not your usual sunny self. That ex-insurance man of ours. - Commissioner Henson? - Yeah. Well, he's ruining our city. He's putting fresh paint on all the public buildings. - Whatever for? - To hide the soot. Cover up But the soot's the only thing that's giving those buildings character. And not only that, they're putting in a new freeway. A freeway? Through our fair city? You know, it's things like that that make you stop and think. I'll be up in my closet, thinking. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Oh! It's from the City Hall. I wonder what they're doing writing to us? Well, this is the time they select the man of the year. I suppose I'll have to resign myself to another giddy round of speechmaking and chicken a la king. Darling, I'm afraid this isn't an invitation to become the man of the year. What is it? It's a condemnation of our property and eviction notice. You're joshing. It seems the new freeway is coming right through our living room. Won't that crowd us a bit? Fear not, querida mía. No city in its right mind would want to ruin this fine old mansion. This notice was obviously sent in error. I'm sure you're right, darling. Reminds me, dear. Better get that hole in the ceiling fixed. Come on now, Cleopatra, darling, you must eat something. Look, this nice lamb chop will put the color back in your leaves. Oh, darling, there's no need to pout. Just because Lurch put on a blue patty instead of a nice pink one. - Gomez, darling, is that you? - No. I'm in here contemplating. Darling, I hate to interrupt your Zen-Yogi, but Don't talk, darling. Just stand there and let me look at you. You were never lovelier. And you're so handsome, darling. With the blue blood of Spanish aristocracy rushing to your cranium. Gomez, did you hear an explosion a moment ago? Oh, that. Probably Uncle Fester down in the basement testing for gas leaks with a lighted match. Oh, I suppose you're right. There goes another one. My goodness, I do hope he doesn't blow himself up. I hope not. He's wearing my best socks. But que será será. That reminds me, dear. We got another letter from the City. - And guess what? - What, querida, what? Thing tore it up. That Thing. Always on his toes. I think we'd better call the gas company. Gomez, I wish you'd stop making that racket. You got my new crocodile so nervous he started chasing his tail and he rolled right out the window. We didn't make that noise, Fester. We thought it was you. Testing for gas leaks. It must be Pugsley. Can't be Pugsley. He and Wednesday are out hunting toadstools. This is very baffling. That last explosion shook the whole neighborhood. Well, here's our next customer. I feel guilty getting paid for this one. You're right, chief. Getting rid of a monstrosity like the old Addams house comes under the heading of sheer pleasure. Well, that highway commissioner of ours might not be the greatest brain in the world, but deliberately routing the freeway through here is a stroke of genius. You're not kidding, chief. Next time he runs, I'm gonna vote for him. Twice. I'll match you to see who pushes the plunger. Thing! I saw him with a gun this morning. Thing. Thing? Thing? Have you been shooting your gun? Hold on. Let me see the gun. I can tell if it's been fired just by smelling it. Just as I thought. Are you sure, Fester? Thing has never lied before. Besides, all those loud noises couldn't possibly be made by such a small gun. Oh, no? Well, hold on to your hat. I still think Thing This is getting irksome. Just when I had the decor arranged so perfectly, too. Oh, I like it this way. It's kind of lived in. Uncle Fester, dear, there's such a thing as too much informality. Now we're getting closer. Well, they said it couldn't be done, but I did it. - Did what, Mama? - Invented artificial thunder. - Didn't you hear it? - You mean you produced those blasts? I always knew that all I had to do was rub these sticks together hard enough. Hey! Why don't we patent it and form a corporation? Capital idea, Fester! Who'll buy thunder? Oh, forget it. Mama, would you grace us with an on-the-spot demonstration? Well, try and stop me, but stand back. We'll need six sticks of dynamite for the entrance here. Better make it eight sticks. We wanna blow this dump so high that you'II Sir, what is the meaning of this intrusion? Don't bother with the small talk. I'll shoot him in the back. Would you mind turning around, please? Certainly not. I'll thank you to stand still. Uncle Fester, please. Fester, this man may be a trespasser and a saboteur, but he is our guest. Saboteur? What are you talking about? I'm just following orders. Orders? Do you suppose he's an enemy agent? If you expect mercy, young man, you'd better come clean. What country are you working for? I don't work for any country. I work for the City. Blowing people to bits? It must be a civil service job. Wait a minute. What are you people doing here? - Didn't you get a notice to vacate? - Notice? You don't expect us to take that absurd notice seriously? That ridiculous missive was an insult to one's intelligence. I'll shoot him in the back. Uncle Fester, please. We do not go around shooting people in the back. - The side? - A fair fight or nothing. Okay. Nothing. You take this message back to your superior. Tell him if he wants to build a freeway through our lovely home, he'll have to blow us up first. That is, he'll have to make other plans. - You rang? - Show the gentleman out. Well, that's that. And despite your position as commissioner, I hereby warn you that any further trespass by your hired vandals will be resisted to the utmost. Commissioner, if you don't mind, I'll wait out here. As you wish. But I assure you, Arthur J. Henson can handle a dozen Addamses. Well, a half dozen. PS, I always knew you were a corrupt, hypocritical old windbag. I do hope he doesn't take that last part personally. How could he? His Honor, the Commissioner. I'm sure he's come to offer his apologies. I guess the hypocritical old windbag isn't such a bad fellow after all. You can cancel that letter, Thing. Addams, what is the meaning of this? The City sent you a check for this property. - Your apology is accepted. - My And here you are, disregarding official notices, obstructing a man in his duties, actually threatening a City employee. Thing, you'd better uncrumple that letter. Sir, your attitude is hardly apt to get our votes at the next election. Having trouble with our saboteur again? Say, you've gained weight. Fester, this is a different man. Aren't you Henson? We're surrounded! Uncle Fester, please, put the gun away. All right, go ahead. Coddle him. See here, you can't fight this. The City is well within its rights. I give you just 24 hours to vacate these premises. Thing, please. Remember your breeding. My dear, don't be too hard on Thing. After all, this is his home, too. He was trying to defend it. You mean to tell me that, that thing understood what I was talking about? You certainly made it plain enough. Well, enough of this nonsense. Remember, 24 hours. You cannot stop the wheels of progress. Thank you. Well, if the City wants a fight, they'll find me ready with the old corpus delicti. Good thing I kept my old law library around. Let's see here. Property Rights From Magna Carta to the Present. What luck. I'd completely forgotten that I'd converted Property Rights into a humidor. I thought Lurch was filching my cigars. We're off to a fine start. A victory before we've even opened the case. Darling, that reminds me. Wear it. It'll be very appropriate. The wig of Lord Chief Justice Sir Anthony Cliveden Addams. No, Lady Abigail Cliveden Addams. Oh. I see you're still sticking pins in the Commissioner. Well, we can't take this thing lying down. - Attention, everyone. - Darling, you've found something? I have gone through the city ordinances, the Bill of Rights and the 17 volumes of assorted jurisprudence, and I have come to a conclusion. - What? - We haven't got a leg to stand on. - Not even if we bribe the judge? - Uncle Fester! - The jury? - Out of the question. Well, you can't win 'em all. They're blasting tomorrow whether we're in the house or not. Oh, dear, and we're such late sleepers. Hey. Why don't we just move this house to another spot? Uncle Fester, that's a brilliant idea! - Old man, you've done it again. - I have? I know just the spot. That lot Hornsby has up for sale. That's right next door to the Commissioner's house. My dear, at a time like this we can't afford to be choosy. It's not that, but that lot doesn't have any caves, and then no quicksand, no swamp. Fester, what's a swamp? A bunch of mud, slime and stench. We'll build our own. Thank you, Thing. Hello, Hornsby? Addams here. How much do you want for that lot? $9,750? Why don't we make it $10,000 even? I hate to write checks for odd amounts. Good, then it's a deal. Well, the property is ours. I'll bet you could have gotten him to take $11,000. It pains me to do the Commissioner such a good turn. The prices in that area will probably skyrocket as soon as word leaks out. Now, darling, there's no sense in bearing grudges. Why don't we call the Commissioner and Mrs. Henson and tell them to come over and hear the good news? Capital idea! The good neighbor policy. Wait here. Arthur, let's get out of here. Now, please, Phoebe, with victory in sight, don't start rocking the boat. I don't want to rock the boat, I want to get off. Look, they are moving. With any luck, to outer Mongolia. I'd even pay their fare. One way. Oh, welcome. Come on, dear. Good evening, Commissioner Henson. How are you? Mrs. Henson, I presume? - Yes. - This is Mrs. Addams. - How do you do? - How do you do? So nice of you to come. Won't you step in, please? And do be seated. I was just telling Arthur. Your home, it's so you. Oh, how sweet of you to notice. - Darling, do ring for Lurch. - Yes! Thank you, Lurch. Tea? Salt, pepper, or cyanide? Neither. Thank you, darling. But you've never tasted Morticia's tea. She picks the tiny, delicate wolfbane leaves herself. Addams, I must say, you're taking this eviction like a good sport. Well, nobody could say that an Addams stood in the way of progress. Although I must admit Uncle Fester is a bit upset. Yes, you see, there are no caves or swamps on our new property. But we do have plans for building our own. That is, if our neighbors don't object. Any man who would object to having a swamp right next to his home is a petty individual indeed. Glad to hear you say that, Commissioner. We love animals and we're planning a mud wallow for our hippopotamus. Arthur and I just adore animals, too. Neighbor. No, no. I mean, you're not going to move in next to - To us? - Right smack. Gomez, darling, when are the men going to start moving the house? Soon as I finish battening down these fine old heirlooms, we're off. My dear, you should wear goggles. This house gets awfully windy when it hits the open road. I think I'll like that. - Seatbelts. - The only way to ride. Where are the children, dear? They're fine. They're riding on the roof. I do hope they don't get carsick. - Is Lurch with them? - Oh, no. He likes to ride with his head out the window and growl at the passing cars. Oh, boy. This is gonna be fun, looking out the window. - Thing. Where's Thing? - Up in the mover's truck. - In the mover's truck? - In the glove compartment. Dear, sensible Thing. Hang on, everybody. All right. Mush! - Hey, this is more fun than the trailer. - I love to see the sights. I wonder what those people are staring at. Well, they probably never saw a stately mansion rounding the corner on two wheels before. - They've stopped. - Probably picking up some hitchhikers. Well, fancy that. The City Commissioner hitchhiking. Sit down, old man. I'm sorry we have no more seatbelts. I didn't come for any ride. Well, it might do you some good. You look like you've been run through a meat grinder. Worse. I mean, I've been up all night with the City Council and we've Well, that is, I've finally persuaded them to reroute the new freeway. You don't have to move after all. That's rather disappointing. I was so looking forward to having you and Mrs. Henson as neighbors. Mrs. Henson is heartsick. - Into each life some rain must fall. - Yes. And about that lot you're stuck with. I'm willing to take it off your hands. Isn't he sweet? Salt of the earth. But we couldn't let you do it. We'll find some use for it. We could use it for a launching pad. Little Pugsley makes the coolest rockets. It'd be a wonderful place for me to practice my bagpipes. Dear Mama. She spends half the night tootling away on those things. Too bad she doesn't know how to play 'em. I insist. I'll see that you get back your $10,000. Nonsense. - $11,000! - Please, you're embarrassing us. - $12,000? - But really $15,000. I beg you. $15,000. Well, we'll have to return the favor sometime. Well, I'm not in the habit of accepting charity, Mr. Commissioner, but in your case I'll make an exception. It's yours for $15,000. Oh, thank you. Thank you. You'll have my check first thing in the morning. Now I'll go and tell the movers to turn around. Well, that won't be necessary. Just tell him to throw it into reverse. $5,000 profit. Not a bad day's work, huh? I think we can all learn a valuable lesson from this. You never lose by being a good neighbor. Dear Thing. He's such a homebody. Strange that the City Council should finally send the freeway straight through the mayor's house. - Was he upset? - No, he said he was happy. - Considering what might have happened. - "Might have happened"? Oh, he probably means the moving of this classic structure from its natural surroundings. It's a pity. He did seem so eager about that swamp we were going to build. Oh, well. C'est la vie. That's French! Good shot, darling! Must be the mating season. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -Is this where the Addams family lives? -Yeah. -You going in there? -I'm the truant officer. They've got two kids who have never set foot in school. Good Iuck, Charlie. Hello. Hello. You must be one of the Addams children. -I'm Wednesday. -I'm Mr. Hilliard. -Are your parents at home? -They're always at home. I'd Iike to see them. You mean you wanna come in? If you don't mind. Nice place you've got here, Wednesday. We Iike it. It's so nice and gloomy. Who's that? WEDNESDAY: That used to be a friend of my daddy's. Wednesday! Wednesday. Here. I fixed it for you. Pugsley is very handy. Fixed her? That doll doesn't have a head. It's Marie Antoinette. Grandmama told us about the French Revolution and Pugsley chopped off her head. Meet you out in the cemetery. Mommy is in the conservatory. Why, you perked up my African strangler. Come here, darling. Mommy, this is Mr. Hilliard. How do you do, Mr. Hilliard. Mrs. Addams, I was sent here My hemlock has been very Iistless Iately. Do you know anything about hemlock? No, Mrs. Addams. I was sent here to What a pity. I think I'II run along and bury Marie Antoinette. Have fun, dear. Just Iook at my beautiful poison oak. Every Ieaf so alive. Mrs. Addams, your children are six and eight years old And growing Iike toadstools. My hemlock continues to droop. They've got to attend school. It's the Iaw. I'd Iove to discuss that with you, Mr. Hilliard, but you see, I can't. You must speak to my husband. The Iaw is his responsibility. That's quite a bell. Yes, Gomez is very fond of it. But we can never use it when we have a cake in the oven. Hello, Mr. Addams. I didn't hear you come in. Lurch is our butler. He will take you to Mr. Addams. Couldn't I just stay here? I'm sure you and I can settle this matter. On the other hand, perhaps it would be better to see Mr. Addams. Follow me. My poor little hemlock. Where have I failed you? I know. You haven't been getting enough moonlight. Mr. Addams. Mr. Addams, I am Sam Hilliard from the Sherwood School. How do you do, Mr. Hilliard? HILLIARD: I just stopped by to talk to you about -They're gonna crash. -You think so, huh? Beautiful. Beautiful. You meant to blow them up? Of course. Why else would a grown man play with trains? You wanna blow the other bridge? Some other time. You know how it is with a small child and new trains. What can I do for you? It's about sending the children to school. Mama's in charge of the education. She's in the guest room playing darts with Uncle Fester. But they've got to go to school. Everybody sends their kids to school. Ridiculous. Why have children just to get rid of them? -I'm opposed to the whole nonsense. -But don't you want them to Iearn? Learn, you say? Look at that. Little Wednesday's. -Spiders. -Pedigreed. Ever known a child who could raise thoroughbred spiders? -No. -There you are. But I was referring to more formal Iearning. Reading. What is there for a six-year-old to read? -But someday she'II be 26. -See you then. Mr. Addams, surely you want your youngsters to be Iike other children. But they are. You should see Iittle Pugsley wrestling with his octopus. -A Iive octopus? -He's all boy. What if he bites him? Mr. Hilliard, Pugsley doesn't bite. A Iittle nip now and then perhaps. But it's all in fun. Well, Iook, this isn't my idea. The board of education We have our own board of education. Mama tutors the children in all the fine arts. Music, painting, ballet. She's the Ionghair of the family. And a fantastic dart player. You only got 10 points. I nipped him in the ear, didn't I? Ear? Watch the master. You're standing right in my way. It's the only safe place. Step aside. Now watch this one. Right in the old gizzard. This is the guest room. That was close. Go ahead, Fester, you get another shot. This time, get him right in the old heart. -What's the matter with your friend? -I don't know. Weird, isn't he? HILLIARD: Then that crazy plant grabbed me. And you should've seen how happy he was when he blew up the bridge. And that big monster they call a butler. He would've frightened Frankenstein. Now, Mr. Hilliard, really. I was there. That knife was aimed straight at my heart. Now, now, calm down. But I got away. PIease try and pull yourself together. Mr. Hilliard, if you'II take my advice, you'II go home and Iie down for a while. If you take my advice, you'II Ieave those Addams kids right where they are. That's the closet. I'm sorry. I never knew he drank. The thorns are so much Iarger this fall. Lovely, Morticia. -You have such a way with roses. -Thank you, Gomez. Did I just hear a peal of thunder? You did, Tish. You did. That's the most heavenly sound. It makes Iife worth Iiving. You remember our honeymoon, Gomez? Who could forget our first night in Death Valley. -There was a stillness in the air. -Tish. The moon was full. And that Iovely soft fluttering of bat wings. And the divine cave. You're so romantic, Tish. I think they're waiting for us, Gomez. The music is so Iovely. Look, darling. I finished it this morning. How do you think cousin Imar is going to Iike his new sweater? -That's odd. -What's odd, dear? I didn't know Cousin Imar wore turtleneck sweaters. Mmm. querida. The mail's in. Never mind, Lurch. I'II get it. Thank you, Thing. It's for you, Mommy. Thank you, darling. Oh, isn't that sweet? What is it, Tish? The Sherwood School insists that we enroll the children immediately. We must've made a very good impression on that Mr. Hilliard. Morticia, you can't send the children to school. I'II be Iost without them. Gomez, I've seen Iittle Wednesday Iooking out the fence at the other children. I think she wants to play with them. Well, she didn't get that from my side of the family. School? I never went to school, and Iook how I turned out. Uncle Fester, Iooks, charm and personality aren't everything. There's such a thing as Iearning and accomplishment. Accomplishment? Who else do you know that's 1 10 volts? FESTER: Watch! Beautiful. I can even make it blink. You do have natural talent, Uncle Fester. But that has nothing to do with Iearning or knowledge. I'II call the school and tell them we'II be there in the morning. -Morticia. -Gomez. Darling. Mother knows best. Now, believe me. We'II send the children to school. School? That's for kids. I'm sure the children are going to be very happy here. If we wanted them to be happy, we'd have Iet them stay home. Now, Miss Comstock, I Wasn't that that nice Mr. Hilliard? He certainly is an odd one, isn't he? -Have you noticed it, too? -Yes. Why, do you know, he suddenly ran out of our house the other day? Frightened by a simple game of darts. I'm going to have to have another talk with him. B-O-O-Z-E. Booze. Really? I guess I underestimated him. Come along, children. Be good today, Wednesday, Pugsley. -PUGSLEY: AII right. -Goodbye, children. Goodbye. Oh, dear. I'm going to miss the patter of their Iittle feet sneaking up behind me. I'm so glad we had no trouble with this. Of course, these cases bring the superintendent down on our necks. And he's the most difficult, troublesome man. Oh? COMSTOCK: And there's always one Iike that in the school system. GOMEZ: Well, I know just how to handle it. You get me his picture and I'II send it to my friend DuBois in Haiti. When he's through sticking pins in it Gomez. You haven't heard from DuBois in years. He may not be taking mail orders anymore. How about a nice old-fashioned horse whipping? GOMEZ: Good, good. Or Iet our boa constrictor give him a good squeeze. A Iittle dip in boiling oil? Miss Comstock, you're my kind of people. Tish, what about Goomba in Nairobi? He gets some wonderful results with just a drum. -And now that we have Telstar -You're so practical. Four minutes after 3:00 and they're not here yet. Are they gonna keep them there for night school? Gomez, a watched cauldron never bubbles. They'd be here by now if they Iet Pugsley drive. By Jove, I think they did. Wednesday. What is it, Wednesday? What is it, darling? That's it. There, there, there. Father, it was terrible. They killed him. -Mr. Hilliard? -The dragon. What dragon? Who killed a dragon? A knight in shining armor. He killed the dragon. I can't believe anyone would kill a dragon. The poor, defenseless dragon. That isn't all. You ought to hear some of the other stories in her book. Let me see that, darling. Grimm 's Fairy Tales. What a Iovely name, Grimm. How could he write such terrible stories? Must be sick. Atavistic cruelty. Perverse barbarism. Such violence. Gomez! That settles it. No more school. Good thinking, sir. That's all right for our children, but what about all the others? I suppose you're right. We should do something. Just as ordinary citizens. I could call that Miss Comstock. No. I'II call that nice Mr. Hilliard and invite him over. And we'II discuss it with him. You know, I really think he Iiked us. Oh, no, no. Never! But, Mr. Hilliard, they insist on seeing you. I'm sorry, I haven't made out my will yet. What if Mr. Hilliard doesn't come? Angel, your father sent Lurch for Mr. Hilliard, and it's very difficult for people to refuse Lurch. He has such a nice way with them. Now, Iet me see your hands. Excellent, Pugsley. The nails are nice and clean and sharp. And you did very well, too, Wednesday darling. I think we took a bath for nothing. Mr. Hilliard. Mr. Hilliard. I'm so glad you could come. MORTICIA: Put Mr. Hilliard in the good chair. That'II be all for now, Lurch. Children. You just never know what they're thinking. I do. GOMEZ: We do have a bone to pick with you, Mr. Hilliard. Haven't we? Perhaps I have done some Iittle thing. Mr. Hilliard, murder is not a Iittle thing. Murder? As if you didn't know. But first, some refreshment. Mama? Uncle Fester? Wait till you see what they've got cooked up for you. The end. It figures. No! No, thank you. -We made it especially for you. -I know, I know. You must taste the cookies. GRANDMAMA: An old family recipe. The bats are my favorites, although the Iizards are good, too. You can feel them wiggling practically all the way down. Time to go. Mr. Hilliard, you're a bundle of nerves. Isn't there something we can do for him, Gomez? Of course. -The rack. -The rack? That stretching, so relaxing. Lurch. You rang? The rack for Mr. Hilliard. No! PIease! I just had it overhauled. I got all the squeaks back in. If I've caused any trouble We're not really blaming you, Mr. Hilliard. But there are some things we just can't tolerate. -Like what? -Like violence. Well, what's wrong with a Iittle Violence? The kind they're teaching the children at school. You did say, "Teaching the children in school"? Come now, Mr. Hilliard. Let's not pretend. Have you read your friend Grimm Iately? Those harmless Iittle fairy tales? GOMEZ: Harmless? Killing a poor defenseless dragon? But there are no real dragons. What gave you that impression? And what about that Hansel and Gretel? Little Hansel and Gretel? Little juvenile delinquents. Pushing sweet old Iadies into hot ovens. Sweet old That's not what you want to feed Iittle children. Of course not. Then why don't you just run right down to the School Board, and tell them to do something about it? Well, I You know, I'm beginning to think you've got something. -You are? Another drink for Mr. Hilliard! -No, please. I'm beginning to see your point. Something must be done. From dragons to toy guns to real guns to bombs to atom bombs! You know what? Thinking Iike yours can save the world. I must confess I misjudged you people completely. Thank you. Do you think he'II convince the School Board? I don't know. He's such a weird Iittle man. Fester, you're not cheating. I'm sorry. Pugsley. He's building Wednesday a Iittle dollhouse. Why, thank you, Thing. Hello. Yes. Wonderful. Yes, the children will be in school tomorrow. Thank you. That was that nice Mr. Hilliard. He said the School Board accepted our ideas enthusiastically. Really? Well, now, Mr. Hilliard may be right. We may have saved the world. Do you think we did the right thing? 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat, Sweet, Petite, So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Now, now, CIeopatra, chew your burgers. Don't gulp them. Darling, now you see what happens when you gulp? Quite enough Iunch. Well, what do they Iook Iike? Oh, just ordinary moving men. One's tall, one's medium. No, darling. I mean, the new neighbors. Oh, I haven't seen them yet. They have some interesting things, though. Really? GOMEZ: There's an item you could do things with. Oh, I do hope they're imaginative. The real estate man said they were newlyweds. At Ieast they're romantic. Really? How nice. I know just how they feel. The joy of moving into a new house. I'II never forget my first night in this Iovely house. -We thought it was haunted. -Well, you can't have everything. I only hope they'II be half as happy. How could they be anything else? With us right next door. Horrible house next door. You suppose anybody Iives in it? Honey, I didn't even know that house was there. As I remember it, the renting agent had the shutters closed on this side. Married by a Justice of the Peace, and no honeymoon and now I spend my wedding night in this house. Well, it could have been worse. You might have had to spend it in that house. What was that? It was an explosion from that monstrosity. I'II go over there and see what's happening. I'II go with you. In sickness and in health, for better, for worse, we're stuck in this thing together. There we are now, down you go. Mmm-hmm. Huh? -There we are. You see them yet? -No. Maybe they'II see us and come over. I still think we should just have gone over and introduced ourselves. Oh, darling, no. That's much too forward. This is better. Here they come. Mmm. Oh, how do you do? I'm Gomez Addams. This is my wife, Morticia. How do you do? Hubert Peterson. This is my wife, Amanda. -We were just married. -Oh, how exciting! You do that again Never mind the small talk. Find out what blew up. Oh, yes. We were just wondering about those Iittle explosions. What explosions? Those explosions. Oh, that must be Uncle Fester playing with his new dynamite caps. What? He got them at the discount house. They are not up to par. You mean there's somebody exploding dynamite inside your house? Where else would he do it? Well, I see you're washing your pup. Oh, good heavens. That isn't a pup. It's an octopus. -You have an octopus for a pet? -Oh, no. It's our son's pet. -Go ahead, shake his tentacle. -Take it away. -Darling, dry it first. -Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. -There we are. -He's really very friendly. (WATER BUBBLING) Let's get out of here. -Yes, well, nice meeting you both. -Nice meeting you. Seems Iike a nice chap. -She's a bit odd. -Little high-strung. It's their wedding day, a new house. And, Aristotle, you were very, very bashful. Time to dry. I had so hoped she'd be someone I could exchange recipes with. Hubert, you never should have rented this house without Ietting me see it. Honey, remember the fantastic deal we got. Well, I guess I'II just have to pretend they're not there. That's my dear, brave girl. -What was that? -What was what? You know what. Those sounds under the house. -Termites? -I knew it. The house is crumbling. It came from over there. Howdy. I'm Uncle Fester, from next door. Gosh, Hubert, he's that dynamite nut. He'II blow us up. I just came over to say hello. Nail that shut. Goodbye, Hubert. I'II call you. -Where are you going? -Out. -Oh, but, honey, this is our wedding day. -Enjoy it. But, honey Oh, Mr. Wentworth, thank goodness you're here. And here's your Iease, all signed and sealed. For a year, this happy honeymoon cottage is all yours. Hubert, either get me another house or get yourself another wife. Now, calm down, honey, calm down. Perhaps Mr. Wentworth will cancel the Iease? Oh, I'm only the rental agent. Well, where do I find the owner? Right next door. His name is Addams. -What'd they hit you with, Fester? -I don't know. I just opened up the trap door and said, "Howdy," and wham! Don't sound very friendly to me. You must have frightened them going through Pugsley's tunnel. Next time, Uncle Fester, knock. -I did. -Really? Gomez, we have ourselves some very peculiar neighbors. Peculiar? They're a couple of nuts. There's only one thing to do. Get rid of them. I can't. I signed the Iease this morning. I'II get rid of them. -I'II go with you, Fester. -Right, Mama. I haven't used this beauty since the taxman was here. -Fester, Mama, control yourselves. -Yes, think of what you're doing. You know, they're right. We better not go over there in broad daylight. -They're Iiable to ambush us. -We'II wait till it's dark. You will do no such thing. They're our neighbors. Excuse me, my dears. Probably them, coming over to apologize. We'd better go out in the backyard and practice, anyway. Just in case. Mr. Wentworth, how nice to see you again. And it's always such a Such a thrill to see you, Mrs. Addams. -My! That's a new dress you're wearing. -How kind of you to notice. GIad you dropped in, Wentworth. Those new tenants, have they signed the Iease yet? They want to break it. Leave that Iovely cottage? With its view of this fine old mansion? -Well, they're young, rattlebrained. -They did seem a bit nervous. But it's their wedding day. -I shook, too, remember? -Yes. Anyway, the Iease is signed, and they'II just have to Iearn to Iive with you. It. We'II try to make them as happy as possible. Ah, you're real people. Well, goodbye, Mr. Addams. -Wentworth. -Mrs. Addams. Those poor Petersons. What can we do for them? I think I know what their trouble is. They are Ionely. You may be right. Oh, Gomez, we've been very selfish. After all, they're newlyweds. I should have been over there a Iong time ago. With a pot of henbane soup, some of my dwarf's hair cobbler and marital advice. -Let's go over right now. -No, darling, I have a better idea. Let's invite them over tonight for a game of bridge. You think they'II wanna play bridge on their wedding night? Of course, it'II relax them. You rang? Lurch, go over to the Petersons' and invite them over for bridge tonight. And, Lurch, use the front door, not Pugsley's tunnel. Yes, Mrs. Addams. -I hope they're sharp players. -Oh, so do I. We haven't had any real competition since the Thompsons were taken away. You think they'II come? Oh, I'm sure they will. Lurch is very persuasive. You see? They've accepted. I do hope everything goes well tonight. How can it fail, my dear? -You're such a perfect hostess. -Darling. And if the bridge gets dull, you can do your animal imitations. Do them now, Tish. -Oh, darling. -PIease. Very well. Now the bullfrog, Tish. That bullfrog, it drives me wild. Let's not play cards tonight, Tish. I feel Iike honeymooning myself tonight. Darling, you're so impetuous. Bridge first, bullfrog Iater. Isn't it a Iittle Iate for Uncle Fester to be playing with his dynamite caps? It's not dynamite, that was a gunshot. Came from the playroom. Better not miss, Fester. Morticia hates bullet holes in her wall. Don't worry. I'm aiming way down Iow at the pigeon's feet. What's going on down here? Well, if you insist on inviting those barbarians from next door over for bridge, I just want to be prepared. Fester's very handy with that gun. He shot a pigeon right through the eye. It wasn't even the one I was aiming at. Oh, Uncle Fester, I'm sure we're not going to have any trouble with that nice young couple. Oh, no? Well, this Iittle beauty mark wasn't caused by a mosquito bite, you know. AII this fuss over a bump on the head. I think it's rather attractive. That's true, Fester. I guess anything's an improvement. Mama will serve the refreshments. I'II serve it to them, right over their heads. You? The soul of graciousness and charm? Well, that's true. Couldn't I just spill some coffee in their Iaps? Not a drop. Well, how about a Iittle cream down their backs? Remember, you're an Addams. Oh, you're right, dear. AII this hostile talk, and those two poor dears are sitting over there just dying to be friendly. -No, no, no! I'm not going over there! -Look, we've got to go. Do you expect me to be nice to those spooks? Oh, please honey. If we break the Iease, he'II sue us. But But if we butter them up, they may Iet us out of the Iease. Now, come on. -Must I? -You must. Well, Iove, honor is one thing, but why do they have to say obey? Well, they should be along any minute now. Oh, I do hope the new neighbors will Iike the house. -Do you think they will? -How can they help it? -It is nice and dismal, isn't it? -Don't be modest, my dear. -It's absolutely bleak. -Thank you, darling. Oh, those roses want trimming. Have you seen my shears, dear? Why, thank you, Thing. Thing, you need a manicure. Look at that. And I did so want you to Iook nice for the new neighbors. Who knows? They might introduce you to a nice girl, Thing. Oh, come now. Don't you ever Iong for something to hold hands with? Woman hater. Very well, Thing. Find your own friends. My dear, I don't think there's time to start clipping roses now. Oh? Well, perhaps you're right. I know. -Beautiful. -Oh, yes. You are so very clever. Thank you, darling. Uncle Fester, what are you doing there? If those neighbors start getting rough-Iike, Genevieve will put them in their right place. Uncle Fester, I will not stand for any bloodshed in my Iiving room. Morticia's right, Uncle Fester. That's a brand new rug in there. However, never fear, my dear. Uncle Fester's aim is terrible. -He's been practicing. -I don't need practice. Even with my eyes shut, I always hit something. You can relax, Morticia. An Addams never starts trouble. He just gets into it. Hubie, please, I can't go in there. Honey, our future's at stake. Now, you've got to go along. -Go along. -And say nothing. -Say nothing. -Be pleasant. -Be pleasant. -And smile. That's it, and no matter what happens, smile. Oh, hello, hello! Welcome, honeymooners. Welcome, welcome. Aren't they thoughtful, dear? Throwing rice? -That's not rice, old man. -It's Iizards' teeth. Lizards' teeth? In the Amazon, no wedding ceremony is complete without the traditional shower of Iizards' teeth. -Lovely. -Lovely. On to the bridge table. My, what a beautiful room. She agrees. How sweet of you to say so. -Is that -Amanda. -What an unusual decoration. -Do you Iike it? Oh, we Iove it. Seems to tell a story. You're the first one to really appreciate it. -It's yours. -Oh, no! We insist. Oh, I see you've noticed another Iittle treasure. -Isn't it cute, dear? Two heads. -Cute. Well, you know what they always say, two heads are better than one. Say no more. Take it. -I wouldn't have that thing -Amanda. -Thank you. -You're welcome. I can see by your expression that you're fascinated by Pierre there. Well, we'II throw him in for good measure, too. -But, I -No buts. Of course not. After all, Pierre would only be Ionely with the turtle gone. -You're so kind. -Kind. -Generous. -Generous. -Smile. -Smile. Don't misunderstand, Mr. Addams. We Iike our house very much. Then why do you want to move out? The rent too high? -Oh, no, no. -Be glad to Iower it. -What would you Iike to pay? -Well, it's not that at all. It's just that it's too far away from the supermarkets. Oh, goodness. You don't need any supermarkets. I know a Iot of Iittle specialty shops. Do you folks Iike fricassee of toad? -Amanda. -Love it. Good. I'II make you up a batch. -What What -Oh, what a wonderful idea. Five-handed bridge. Dear Thing. Loves to kibitz. Thing, say hello to the Petersons. Nice to meet you. -Do you mind if I smoke? -No, go right ahead. Hubert! I just don't understand their running out that way. We couldn't have been friendlier. Neither could Thing. He has such a wonderful social instinct. Tries to make everyone feel right at home. Maybe it's because he was kibitzing. That makes some bridge players terribly nervous. Oh, I don't think so, dear. Besides, the card he threw was absolutely right. They certainly Iiked our home. Gomez, was it impolite of me to smoke? Querida mia, everyone smokes. Gomez, do you think it's possible they could have been frightened by the shot? -What shot? -Uncle Fester's gun. Oh, that. Well, they were a bit jumpy. Darling, of course they were jumpy. It was their wedding day. How could we have been so blind? -That about right, my dear? -Perfect, darling. GOMEZ: It all goes to prove how foolish superstition can be. Here our young friends get married on Friday the 13th, and just Iook how beautifully everything turned out. Well, Iooking a Iittle better, isn't it? -It's the most gosh-awful -Smile, Hubert. It's beautiful. We knew when we saw you admiring our Iovely fish that you were people of taste. Our kind of people. Excuse me. -Hubert, do you Iove me? -Of course I Iove you. Do you really Iove me? Well, I wouldn't have married you if I didn't Iove you. Then prove it. Get those people and their awful things out of my house. Honey, I can't. We've gotta be nice to him to get out of the Iease. I don't care about your silly Iease. Either you get us out of this whole mess or I'm Ieaving. I think I've got an idea. -Well, whatever it is, try it. -I will. -Mr. Addams? -Yes. -I'd Iike to talk to you. -Certainly. Go right ahead. Well, before you go to any more trouble, I think I ought to tell you the real reason we can't stay in this house. Oh, what's that? Well, I got a wire from my company, and I'm being transferred to Hong Kong. Say no more. I understand and I'II take care of it. Would you? After all, Peterson, what are neighbors for? Oh, the dear Petersons. I do hope they're feeling better today. They're bound to, after I tell them the good news. Oh, here they are. Come in, come in. I have capital news for you, old man. -You mean we're free to move? -Au contraire, you're free to stay. -What? -What? I bought your company and you don't have to go to Hong Kong. You can stay and be our neighbors forever. Oh, the poor dears. I guess the excitement was just too much for them. Cigar, Thing? I forgot. You can't smoke. Oh, boy! Very clever play, Thing. Darling, the oddest thing happened. The Petersons Ieft all those Iovely things we gave them on our front Iawn. Probably thought we were being too generous. Perhaps. Still, it's strange. We haven't seen them in three days. Darling, it's their honeymoon. Oh, yes, of course. I forgot. They must be starved. I think I'II take them over a nice casserole of yak, knock discreetly, then tiptoe away. -What if they don't Iike yak? -Not Iike yak? Darling, you make them sound weird. No, the king. -What in the world brought that on? -Probably resented your helping me. After what he did at our bridge game? Thing? Open up. Thing! I do not Iike petulant things. Now, was that nice? Very well, that's better. Your play, Thing. Beats me every time. Forget it, darling. Forget the Petersons. Do the bullfrog for me, Tish. PIease. PIease. Very well. It's our turn now. They won't see us for three days. Bubele, 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family There's nothing more romantic than a dark, chill attic in a thunderstorm. We spent some of our happiest moments up here, on nights like this. Darling, will you ever forget our honeymoon? That wonderful sandstorm in Death Valley. You sang my favorite song to me, Sand Gets in Your Eyes. Tish, we haven't been alone up here since the flashflood on Valentine's Day. Gomez. Yes, querida? You're dripping. Zounds! For want of a shingle, a lovely moment is lost. Just move over. No, darling, please. I don't want all that water sloshing around up here. No problem. There. If that little Dutch boy had had a cigar, he wouldn't have gotten his thumb wet. Darling, isn't that Great-Grandfather Peg leg's old sea chest? By george, so it is. Peg leg, the last of the adventurous Addams. He was adventurous, all right. Wanted by 15 countries for piracy. Well, let's see what we have here. Darling, what's this? A sextant. My, wasn't he the naughty one. Old Peg leg's peg leg. Oh, the poor thing. How did he lose his leg, dear? He didn't. Just wore this for appearances. Stylish. Look, darling, a map. Maybe it shows in what waters they buried the old boy. Oh, was grandfather Peg leg buried at sea? Full military honors. Handcuffed. Blindfolded. Dropped off a plank. Poor dear. He probably never had a chance to pick up his treasure. Or his insurance. Did you say "treasure"? That's what the map says. The exact locations and whereabouts of Peg leg Addams' sunken treasure. See? Looks like the Sargasso Strait. Darling, why don't we just toddle over and pick it up? - A treasure hunt? - Why not? We lead such routine lives. Magnificent idea. Out on the seven seas. Wind in the rigging. Salt spray in our faces. And us lashed to the mast. Oh, how thrilling. Darling, what about your sinuses? Did old Peg leg worry about his sinuses? When he was the scourge of the seven seas? - When he walked the plank. - Oh, yes. I forgot. This is going to be so exciting. Darling, what flag shall we sail under? The flag we Addamses have always sailed under. The Jolly Roger. Sunken treasure. I knew Fester would spark to the adventure of it. Oh, I love adventures, just so there's money involved. Uncle Fester, we're not going for the money. The gold? Aren't you buccaneers forgetting something? - The jewels. - No, the children. They're in school. Well, we'll just take them out of school. Yes. The principal's always suggesting it, anyway. But it'll only be temporary, of course. - Mommy. - Speak of the little devils, here they are. Wednesday, Pugsley darling, how was school? - Terrible. - A real drag. Especially History. Nothing ever happens in History, except names and dates. Yeah, they never tell us anything interesting. Like, how many heads they chopped off in the French Revolution. That's the trouble with the schools. They just don't make these executions come alive. But, darlings, we're going to change all that. We're going to make history interesting by living it. You mean, we're going to chop off someone's No, no, no, darling. I mean, we're going to take a wonderful trip, and look for treasure. Just where is this supposed treasure? Right here. But, first, we better get rid of this. Now, we start at point X, go 22 degrees north by northeast. Follow the equator, past the Tropic of Cancer, and turn left. Then, where are we? - Lost. - Nonsense, dear. You just follow this red line from here to Darling, there's something missing here. You're right. What's missing is the half of the map that shows where the treasure is. Yuck. Watch your language, Wednesday. Darling, that was the only thing that was in the trunk. The rest of it must be around the house somewhere. Right! We'll divide ourselves into search parties. Oh, that bell's out of order again. Have to use the spare. You rang? Lurch, we have a small problem. We must find the lost half of this treasure map. Now, we're gonna have to search high and low. So, Lurch, you search high, and, children, you search low. But what about me? Uncle Fester, darling, why don't you take the playroom, the caves, and the wine cellars? Mama, you take the art gallery, the discotheque, and the kitchen. Thing, search between every wall. Now, everybody spread out. Darling, aren't you going to help us look? Querida, a captain just gives orders. Aye, aye, sir. You'll make a lovely first mate. First mate? Are you planning on others? Cara mia, not the kind you're thinking about. Four bells. Think I'll go aft and shiver my timbers. Darling, you sound so nautical. I can just see you now. On the bridge, at the helm, guiding us through storm-tossed seas. Through squalls and gales. And I will. If I don't forget my seasick pills. I think I better go see if I have any. - Hey, Morticia, look what I found. - The map? Oh no, something better than that. A case of rum. You know, you can't go to sea without a yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. But, Uncle Fester, do you think it's still drinkable? Well, there's only one way to find out. Well, at least it was a great year for corks. Morticia, Fester, don't give up the ship, mates, here's the missing map. Oh, darling, they match perfectly! - Eureka! The treasure hunt is on. - Oh, goody! Now, we have one small problem. How're we going to get there? Nothing to it. Start at point X. Go 22 degrees north by northeast, follow the equator, past the Tropic of Cancer, and turn left. No, darling. - Turn right? - No, Morticia means, we haven't got a ship. All we need is a cozy little vessel with a tight-lipped crew. To ensure top secret, we'll be our own crew. Darling, with you in command, how can we go wrong? - Well, I'll tell you - We'll have no mutinous talk, sir! Unless you like to be flogged, keel-hauled, and thrown into iron. You know something? I think I'd like that. It's the sea in his blood. Well now, where do we find a boat? Where we find everything, of course, in the classified. Let's see, boomerangs, bottle tops, boats. Thank you, Thing. Here's one. Captain Grimby's Charter Boat Service. "No job too ridiculous. " - Sounds like our man. - I'll call him. Oh, goody! That Fester, knows all the latest dances. Captain, are you sure you want to rent them that leaky tub of ours? If their money ain't leaky. Well, I got dibs on the lifeboat. You and me, both. Come in, gentlemen. Welcome aboard. Been expecting you. Well, I'm Captain Grimby. This is my first mate, Mr. Brack. How do you do, Grimby? Brack. Been doing some deep-sea diving in the bath tub. Wonderful practice. - Gentlemen. - This is my lovely wife, Morticia. You men of the sea have a certain air about you. We just got off a tuna charter. As you can see, we're getting a few things ready for the voyage. Is that a bed of nails? Oh, yes. A few homey touches will make the ship much more comfy. I'm afraid you've come at feeding time. Excuse me. There, Esmeralda. She must have her daily ration of iron. Of course, we'll take our own piranha. They keep the ship's galley so nice and neat. Now, men. Let me brief you. Maybe the briefer, the better. Your duties will be basically light. Pull the hawsers, prepare the mess. - Prepare the mess? - You can clean it up, too. When the piranha get tired. Make sure there's plenty of port on the portside. Now, wait a minute. Who's going to run this ship? Don't pry, Grimby. Due to the secrecy of the mission, key positions will be handled by the family. What's that? That's our Cousin Itt. He's our lookout. He's your lookout? Don't be fooled by the glasses, Brack. He's got the eye of an eagle. Plus, a few of his own. Well, here I am. All ready to help dive for the treasure. What treasure? Great-Grandfather Peg leg's treasure. He dropped it overboard during the mutiny. Mutiny? Who was mutinying? Great-Grandfather Peg leg. We have the exact location of the treasure, right here. - Let me see that. - Not so fast, Grimby. First I must have your solemn vow of secrecy. - I vow, I vow. - Good enough. Where did you get this thing? In a box of corn flakes? In a box of corn flakes? What do we look like? A pack of nuts? Give this man a cigar. Come on, Captain, let's go. Very well, Captain, if you're not interested in $10 million of Spanish gold, we'll find someone else. Did you say $10 million? Could be $20 million, but what does it matter, as long as we have fun? Excuse me. Sargasso Strait, eh? Yeah, there were a lot of treasure ships sunk there. Old Peg leg sank most of them. But even if the treasure's there, do you realize what an expedition like this would cost? Not exactly, Captain. 50,000? You think it's real money? It ain't cigar coupons. Friend, you've found your man. We'll be back tomorrow with a list of stores. I guess I misjudged you fellows. Well, of course. Why should we think you're a pack of nuts? Yeah, that was silly of me. Captain, are you actually gonna take those goofs on this trip? We're gonna take them, but not on any trip. Uncle Fester, dear, what are you doing? Getting some more equipment ready, like this extra-special life preserver. Oh? And this anchor that'll hold a boat real steady. Must've gotten the materials mixed. Well, everything else checks out, and in case we run out of food, I got my harpoon. I'll harpoon a whale. Thar she blows! Uncle Fester, you've wrecked the plumbing. So what? Whales don't have any plumbing, and, if we get attacked by pirates, I'll give them what for with old reliable. Right on target. I'll put this map in the safe before we have anymore mishaps. Oh, Gomez, let me crack the safe. Uncle Fester, we have the combination. I know, but it's so much more fun blowing it. Sorry, old man, but we're fresh out of dynamite. It's all set. Now, watch this. By george, it was booby trapped. Real fun, and a great burglar alarm, too. Dear Uncle Fester, someday your name will be linked with Edison, Marconi, and Einstein. Thank you, Morticia. That is a great law firm. - This is gonna be a snap. - Yeah. Hey, it's the chubby coop, what do we do? Ignore him. Let's just look around. Who's there? It's you. For a minute there, I thought it was burglars. Burglars? Us? Yeah, but you fellows aren't supposed to be here till tomorrow. We just came to take another look at the treasure map. - Where is it? - In the safe. Where's the safe? Right in back of Uncle Droop. Thanks. The next one better not be Uncle Droop. That's Aunt Drip. Come on. All right, open up. No one's allowed to open this safe but Morticia and Gomez. Looks like a little persuasion is in order. How does that feel? Best migraine treatment I ever had. Okay, wise guy. Give it another turn. Beginning to get to you, huh? Oh, boy, that's really good. Does this feel good, too? No, that gives me a headache. Come on, talk. Combination to the safe, let's have it. Okay, let's see, 35-right. Or is that 35-left? Say, fellows, there's something about this safe I feel you ought to know. Just give the numbers, chubby. - All right, let's see. Right-81. - Right-81. - Left to 64. - Left-64. - Make that 63. - 63. - Left to 29. - Left-29. - Back to 13. - Back to 13. - Back to 16. - Back to 16. - Left to 22. - Left to 22. Now, pull the handle. Okay. That burglar alarm needs fixing. Either that, or it was 35-right. I don't know about you, Captain, but I'm getting out. Sorry, fellows. Fester, what's going on here? Boy, you sure picked a couple of lulus. That Grimby and Brack tried to swipe the treasure map. - Oh, dear. - Morticia, would you get me out of here? Yes. That was very unsporting of them. Just for that, we won't charter their ship. You mean you're going to call off the trip? Of course not, we'll buy our own boat. - Of course! We still have the treasure map. - Oh, good. Oh, darling, what about the other Addams' valuables? Well, let's see. Cousin Itt's baby comb. My bugle! I'm glad this didn't get damaged. Sorry, old man, just wanted to see if you're on your toes. Darling, what's this? "Peg leg Addams' secret code book. " "Without which the Peg leg Addams treasure map is absolutely worthless. " Darling, shall we pinpoint the treasure then? Right. I'll give you the map markings and you give me the locations. Very well. Double-Y Z. Double-Y Z is Jamaica. Now, follow the red line to Triple-Y M. Triple-Y M. Zanzibar. Right. Now, we're closing in. Now, the yellow line to quadruple-T. Quadruple-T is Novaya Zemlya. Your Russian is flawless. Now, the purple line to quintuple-O. Quintuple-O is the Fiji Islands. Perfect! Now, from here we simply bisect the transit, adjust for drift, and here is where the treasure lies. The Antipodes? No, right under our house. Under our house? How lucky for us that those men tried to rob us. Otherwise, we'd be off on a wild goose chase. Darlings, let's drink to our good fortune. Capital idea. Thank you, Thing. Dear Thing, he's always there when you want him. Just a moment, I better taste it first. Nothing like a safe to give a wine just the right mellowness. Keep digging, darlings, I'm sure that treasure's down there somewhere. I think I hit something. That's my foot! What's it doing under our house? It's not under the house, it's under your shovel. Sorry, sorry. A treasure chest! A great moment is at hand. Okay, heave. There it is. Hodgebotkins. We'll have to shoot off the lock. Stand back, everyone. My other foot! I told you to stand back. All right. By george, it's gold! It's a king's ransom. Is it real? There's a very simple test. Well, old Peg leg never was too bright about these things. You mean, we've wasted our time? Not at all. It's delicious. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family I had no idea Cousin BIeak was such a difficult subject. You're painting him from memory and it's a magnificent Iikeness. -Superb! -Thank you, darling. There's something about the eyes, I just can't seem to get them. That Iid droops just a bit too much. -The right eye or the Ieft? -The middle one. Perfect. That's the Iook that used to get the girls. Darling, the children are going to be Iate for their birthday party. Would you ring for Lurch? -You rang? -Yes, Lurch. Would you get the children, please? WEDNESDAY: We're coming! PUGSLEY: We're coming! -Oh, what's that, darling? -Harold's birthday present. A tarantula. Oh, dear Pugsley. He's so generous. That old Addams tradition, a heart of gold. Well, we'II have to have it gift-wrapped. Let's see now. A birthday present. Festive occasion. -I think black would be appropriate. -BIack it is, my dear. Here, darling, Iet me do that. You're all thumbs. Wouldn't that be interesting? -Lurch, please take the children to the car. -LURCH: Yes, madam. Where are they going? Whee! To the Pomeroy boy's birthday party. You mean those people with the white picket fence and the pink geraniums? How could you? There's something to what he says, Morticia. They are a bit peculiar. I bet they've got daisies in their backyard. PIease don't make me ill. Now, now, now. We must be tolerant of our neighbors. Thank you, Thing. There you are, Pugsley! GOMEZ: Your mother is still the world's best tarantula wrapper. Now remember, children, not every family is as fortunate as we are. Not everyone has a beautiful old house Iike ours. And a car with all the right sounds and smells. You must be modest about our advantages. -We'II be good. -I know you will, darling. I'm sure Harold will Iove his present. Bye, children! Have a good time. Pugsley, only five pieces of cake, now! Well, I guess I'd better go in and finish knitting my tea cozy. Morticia, don't move. Remember how I carried you across the threshold that first time? Not only across the threshold, but through the Iiving room and up the stairs and into our room. And I dropped you only once. I'II swear these fish seem to know when you're gonna feed them. They're a Iot more aware than people give them credit for being. That's breeding. There's no waste with piranha. Darling, I think the children are home. I wonder what the children are doing back so soon? I don't know. Why are you home from the party so early? GOMEZ: What happened? Was there trouble? A small altercation. Harold Pomeroy said his family was better than our family. He said we were a bunch of kooks. Kooks? Oh, he couldn't have meant it. Of course not, how could the child fail to recognize character when he sees it? I told you the Pomeroys were no good. With their neat Iittle petunia patches. Riffraff! I tell you, they're nothing but riffraff. Lurch, you better take the children to their rooms. LURCH: Yes, madam. I always did suspect those white plaster ducks out on the Iawn. Darling, some people have a twisted sense of beauty. Rude behavior Iike that begins with the parents. Well, what are you gonna do about it? Just stand there and take it? Certainly not. I'm going to send Pomeroy an insulting Ietter. Darling, I don't think we should Iend our name to such a thing. He could sign it, "A friend. " An insulting Ietter signed, "A Friend. " That would be novel. I think we should turn the other cheek. No, when people insulted me, I always turned the other cheek. -Well? -I ran out of cheeks. No, there's only one way to settle this. Uncle Fester! Uncle Fester, please, not that. -But, Morticia, the family honor! -He's right, Morticia, the family honor. You'II have to challenge Pomeroy to a duel. No, I'd rather shoot him in the back. Uncle Fester, that is not the honorable way. I know, but it's the safe way. Uncle Fester, I'm ashamed of you. An Addams doesn't know the meaning of the word fear. I do. I'II shoot him in the back. Uncle Fester, remember the Addams name! It'II have to be a duel. With swords? With victory going to the swiftest, the cunningest, the deadliest. I'II shoot him in the back. -Wait, how about pistols? -Well, that's different -Does he get one, too? -Naturally. -Loaded? -You get one bullet apiece. In the back. We have visitors. It's Mr. Pomeroy. Little Harold is with him. -See? They've come to make peace. -I hope not. I'II handle this. Remember, you took care of the gas inspector. Darling, why don't we handle this together? -A Pomeroy does not slam gates. -I didn't slam it, Dad. -A Pomeroy does not Iie, either. -But, Dad Come along. I'm Cecil B. Pomeroy. Perhaps you've heard of me. I'm in oil. Oh, boiling? Lubricating. I wouldn't make Iight of this. Look at my son Harold. Fine-Iooking boy. Nice eyes. Well, one of them, anyway. And that's what your hoodlum offspring did with his fists. Our son used his fists? AII those karate Iessons wasted! I'II thank you both to stop joking. My son has been sorely wounded and I demand an apology. Very well, Mr. Pomeroy. If it'II make you happy, I apologize. Not from you. From that pugnacious child of yours. -Him. -Children. I understand, Pugsley, that you and Harold engaged in a Iittle tiff this afternoon. -AII I did was tear his jacket a Iittle. -You tore my family crest. Well, you wouldn't have got a sock in the eye if you hadn't said your family was better than our family. -Our family is better. -It is not. Children, children. I think you ought to apologize to Harold. I'm sorry I punched you in the eye, Harold. She must have hit him while his back was turned. In the eye? I don't know, it's possible. Remember my Cousin Curdle? Yes! Well, we're sorry about the whole mess, Pomeroy. Yes, won't you come in and have a cup of tea? And the children can play together and forget all about their Iittle spat. -Well -Do come in. -I'II Iet you ride my jaguar. -Can I, Dad? AII right, but stay in the yard. Don't go into the street. Oh, we never run the jaguar out in the street. Come on, Harold. I'm so glad we got this thing straightened out. Yes, we're not only neighbors but I find we have some adjoining Iand along the county Iine. You got stuck, too! Yes. That doesn't happen to the Pomeroys usually. It's one of the things we're proud of. Matter of fact, we asked Professor Simms to trace our family genealogy back to -Merciful heavens! What was that? -Pugsley's jaguar. Pugsley's You mean that your child is having my son ride a wild animal? Don't worry, when Fang makes that noise, nobody rides him. There, you see? They've already found something else to amuse them. Nothing Iike the Iaughter of happy children, is there, Pomeroy? Well, my son has Iittle time for frivolity. After all, he's being trained to follow in the family Excuse me. Is that thing real? Everything in our home is real, Mr. Pomeroy. Taste! There's quite a story behind that trophy, Pomeroy. Cousin Farouk was a skin-diver. He dived out of a rowboat in an attempt to spear a rare species of eel. At the same moment a big fish swept up from the depths, also after the eel. -They were on a collision course. -The rest is taxidermy. HAROLD: I did it! I did it! Little Pugsley is teaching Harold how to handle dynamite caps. Dynamite? There, you see? Their Iittle spat of this afternoon is all forgotten. We adults could Iearn a Iot from our children, eh, Pomeroy? -More tea, Mr. Pomeroy? -No, thanks. That thing bit me! I'm sure you're mistaken, Mr. Pomeroy. Our birds would never attack Iiving things. Children, stop playing with that trap door. Uncle Fester just greased it. Your trap door? -In the playroom, for our gallows. -It's a family heirloom. -PUGSLEY: We're sorry, Harold! -Don't be mad, Harold. We're sorry we dropped him through the trap door. Addams, what the devil have they been doing? Can't you see? PIaying! POMEROY: Harold! Addams, I never wanna see these two Iittle creeps in my home again. And I promise you that never again will I set foot in this menagerie. In that case, sir, I'II have to ask you to Ieave. Ask me? I can hardly wait to get out of Lurch, show Mr. Pomeroy out. Addamses, you are kooks. Calling our children creeps. Bawling off about his ancestry, his professor, his genealogist. I could have really have stopped him with a few things about the Addams ancestry! -Why didn't you? -I couldn't think of anything. You're right. You're right, I should have told him. But it's been so Iong since I've Iooked into the family records. Anybody can tell what kind of a family we are. But to him, we're peasants. We need proof. Proof! And I'II ram it down Mr. BIowhard's throat. I'II get you your proof, darling. I'm going to call in a genealogist. -We'II get his Professor Simms. -He can trace our family tree. Trace it? I know where it is. Uncle Fester sits in it every day. The mail's in. Thank you, Thing. -It's for you, Mommy. -Thank you, darling. Oh, isn't that sweet? It's from Professor Simms, the genealogist. He says, "Working on a family tree Iike yours should be a real challenge. " We better get all the Addams family heirlooms and records together. My dear, I've already dug up a Iot of material. Isn't that beautiful? -Oh, the old Addams barn. -Darling, that's Aunt BIemish. Are you sure? You maybe right. -Oh, I don't recognize those two at all. -That's only one. Of course, Grandpa SIurp. I should have known him by his buck teeth. And receding chin. He was a handsome devil. Remember this picture? -Cousin CIot! -Just before they threw the switch. My, he was photogenic. I'II never forget the day the judge imposed sentence. CIotty stood there, head high, shoulders back, and said, "It's a bum rap. " An Addams to the end. Darling, we better get these things ready. That does it. I doubt that I could have made one more trip to the attic. I hope the genealogist's got enough material to work with. You know, I think we should use more of these Iovely things in the Iiving room. I didn't know Granduncle Grisly was a traitor. Oh, yes! But he only did it for money. Is Professor Simms still working in the Iibrary? Yes, darling. I think you better take these things in to him. I'II get the doorbell, Lurch. -I came to return this gift. -Is there something wrong with it? I don't know. Weren't you surprised when you opened it? I sure was. It was empty. Pugsley? Your birthday present escaped. Better Iet Harold pick out something else. Okay. Come on up to my room, Harold, and pick out what you want. I'm not supposed to stay. A call for Master Pomeroy. Come along, children. -Hello? -Did you return the present? Yes, and I'm getting out of here as fast as I can. No, no! Tell them it was all a mistake. A horrible mistake. Yes. Act nice and friendly. Yes, friendly. They have some Iand next to mine and my man thinks there's oil on it. Just act nice and friendly and I'II be over there soon. My dad said it was all a horrible mistake. I'm to be nice and friendly. Oh, that's Iovely. Pugsley, you must Iet Harold play with your octopus. Not that friendly. Oh, don't be a sissy. Well, all right. I'II even show you how to juggle meat cleavers. Morticia, Professor Simms feels he's on the trail of something. Oh, I do hope it's something gloomy. For a moment I thought there might be some relationship to the New England Adamses, John and John Quincy. People often assume that. It's been a great source of embarrassment to us. We spell our name with two "D's". The additional "D" makes the difference. Good heavens! Do you suppose that's the reason Mr. Pomeroy thought there was something wrong with us? -Professor, is something wrong? -Oh, no. No, no, that is Well, things do seem a bit off. I've traced Mrs. Addams back to the early colonial days at Salem, Massachusetts. Interesting place, Salem. -They burned witches there, you know. -Yes. I'm certainly glad they don't do that today. And I found a family of Addamses Iiving in a native village far up the Amazon river, deep in the jungle. But the head of the family seems to have disappeared. Completely? Usually they just shrink them. Yes. And I've established that one ancestor back in 270 A. D. used this torch to set fire to the Iibrary at AIexandria, Egypt. Mamoud Khali Pasha Addams, the firebug of the Bosporus. We should tell Mr. Pomeroy about him. Oh, the Pomeroy background has quite a few unusual characters, too. Really? But I do think that professional ethics forbids me discussing it. Of course. Otherwise I would tell you of Pegleg Pomeroy, the scourge of Denver, Erwin Pomeroy, the hanging judge, and Haversham Pomeroy, the BIuebeard of Boston. Well, what do you know? It's quite an impressive background. I don't blame him for feeling superior. Darling, sometimes you can just misjudge people. Pomeroy, come in. -PIease have a cigar. -Oh, no, thank you. Mr. Pomeroy. You know, I believe I owe you both an apology. Not at all, it's we who owe you an apology. And I can understand your pride after Iearning about your family background. -Lovely rug. -Thank you. -Do sit down. -Thank you, thank you. Delighted. The children are upstairs playing with Iittle Pugsley's octopus. -Live, of course. -How did you know? Every young boy should have a Iive octopus. We do think alike, don't we? True, true. And as a Iittle peace offering, I'd Iike to take that awful acreage that we both got stuck with off your hands. Same price you paid for it, of course. $1,000 an acre. Let's not talk about business. Let's talk about our illustrious families. Why didn't you tell us about Pegleg Pomeroy? I beg your pardon? Oh, come, Mr. Pomeroy, we know all about him. Quite a streak of skullduggery in the Pomeroy Iine, isn't there? Well, I And don't tell us you're going to deny knowing anything about Grapeshot Pomeroy. -Pomeroy is a very common name. -Isn't he the modest one? I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. Aren't you proud of being descended from a pirate? -I'II pay you $2,000 an acre. -Isn't he generous? BIuebeard Pomeroy would be proud of him. BIuebeard -$3,000 an acre. -Well, if you insist. My check will be here first thing in the morning. -You come back, paleface. -Oh, isn't that sweet. Get me away from these barbarians. He's had a tiring day. Harold, the Addams family is every bit as good as ours. Well, BIack Bart and BIoody Addams, true. -You see? -Now say goodbye to your Iittle friend. -Bye. -Goodbye, Harold. -Goodbye, Mr. Pomeroy. -Goodbye. Harold, you forgot to say goodbye to Kitty. No! Now, Harold, we must say goodbye to Kitty. Here, Kitty. Here, Kitty. What happened to the Pomeroys? These businessmen. AIways in such a hurry. Really nice of Pomeroy to take all that worthless Iand off our hands. How do you know it's worthless, darling? Well, one thing's certain, there's no oil on it. It's been checked and rechecked. Guess he just wanted to apologize for calling us kooks. Thank you. Right in the heart! Morticia, your aim is perfect. So female. So deadly. So Iovely. Darling, where's Professor Simms? Do you think? No, Kitty can't stand the taste of people. 
Nothing like a quiet evening at home. Oh, the mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Did I hear the mail? Well, it's probably just the usual stock dividends, I suppose. Or another refund from the treasury department. Gomez, darling, it's the tax bill on this house. - Bully! How much are they asking for? - Well, let's see. After the municipal fund, the sinking fund, the land improvements, it comes to a grand total of $84! $84! On this gem of a house? - Why, that's an insult. - See for yourself. The simple case of a displaced decimal. - It should read $8,400. - More likely $84,000. It shouldn't be a penny less for such a magnificent mansion as this. Now, darling, you go right back to your Zen-Yogi. - I'll handle this by phone. - Good thinking, my dear. Why, thank you, Thing. Hello, tax department? This is Mrs. Addams. Yes, there's been a rather amusing typographical error on our tax bill. $84. Oh, thank you. They realize there's been an error. They're checking it out now. Oh, yes. And what is the revised? - $8. 40? - Let me at it. Hello, there. Now, see here! Hello? Hello? Hello? $8. 40. The insult supreme. You're not going to take that lying down, are you? Lying down? Certainly not. I'm going to stand right here and do a little thinking. Gomez, I think we ought to pay a little visit to the Mayor. Quick, Your Honor, it's that Addams family. They've been here twice. I'll stall them until you can duck down the fire escape. Cut out the melodramatics, Clyde. - They're our voters, aren't they? - Well, anything is possible. And there is an election coming up. Now, show them in. - This is the season to be friendly. - Friendly to the Addams family? - And they're taxpayers, aren't they? - Lf you say so. Mr. And Mrs. Addams coming up, sir. Mrs. Addams, Mr. Addams, do forgive the delay. Please sit down. The work of your mayor is never done. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Darling, show His Honor that ridiculous tax bill on our house. - Here you are, sir. - Ridiculous. It is out. Just a moment. You never even looked at it. Well, I didn't have to. I've looked at your house. - We'll cut it in half. - The house? No, no, dear lady. The tax bill. As a matter of fact, we'll cancel it altogether. Or, to be really fair, we'll send you a rebate. Great Scott, look at the time! I'm going to be late for that cornerstone ceremony. Do forgive me, do forgive me. Goodbye. Clyde! Incompetence in office. The bane of our existence. To think that in the last election I voted for that unmitigated scoundrel. Not only that, darling, you voted for him twice. Well, I cast my first vote so early it slipped my mind. Somewhere, someplace there must be a politician who's a little less of a conniving, bumbling hack than Mayor Henson. But who? I don't know who. But if I find him, he's going to get some mighty strong support in this coming election. Now, darling, put your hand up like this and repeat after me. If I'm elected, ladies and gentlemen If I'm elected, ladies and gentlemen Let's face it. Today you can't be elected without a political machine behind you. And unfortunately, I don't have one. Oh, yes, you do, dear. Uncle Fester? There. Your old friend Wizzo. The best machine a man can have behind him. Come along, dear. Say something to Wizzo, darling. - Go on, anything. - Anything? Yeah, make a little speech. All right. Ladies and gentlemen. By george, that's a first-rate political machine, all right. It's been programmed for instant politics. Would you like a smoke-filled room? It also answers political questions. All right, here's a political question. How did a nincompoop like Henson ever get elected in the first place? Oh, that's an easy one. "Mayor Henson got elected by conniving, wheeling and dealing "and lots of razzle-dazzle. " I wish the whole world could have heard that. It will, Gomez, it will. And now, Wizzo, how can a fine, upstanding citizen like Gomez Addams defeat Mayor Henson? "A fine, upstanding citizen like Gomez Addams can defeat Mayor Henson "by even more conniving, wheeling, dealing and razzle-dazzle. " I'm afraid there's still a few bugs left in Wizzo. Fix it, Uncle Fester. You're not going to let a little thing like that stop you, are you, bubele? Tish - When you say that word - Well, are you? If the enlightened citizens, my fair constituents of this glorious community do me the honor of electing me your mayor, I promise that And rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that the Addams campaign will remain dignified, on a high level and completely free from the scurrilous tactics of my conniving, double-dealing scoundrel of an opponent. Three high-level copies of that speech, Thing, when you get around to it. Thank you, Thing. That's one, two, three. Very good. "Conniving, scurrilous" Excellent. Excellent work, Thing. - Gomez, darling. - Yes, my dear. It's time for your baby-kissing practice session. Where would my campaign be without your firm hand on the tiller of the good ship Addams? - Let's get started, dear. - Right. Yes, yes. - Oh, Mr. Addams. - Yes. Both my baby and I did so love your speech. We're both going to vote for you. Thank you, madam. And thank you, my manly little fellow. Or girl, as the case may be. - That perfume you're wearing. - Oh, sir. Mr. Addams. Gomez! It's the only way to run a campaign. The press. - I'm Brown from The Sun. - Well, you certainly look it. Well, obviously you're here to question me about my campaign. - Fire away. - Well, are you a candidate? - No comment. - No comment? That's off the record. Dear, I believe the young man wants to know what position you take. My position? Well, I grasp the club firmly, put the weight on my right foot and wham! No, no, dear. He wants you to make a statement. Very well. Look to the record. - I'll make it easier for you. - Very well. How do you feel about slums? Oh, preserving our historical landmark is his first consideration. Start out picking on slums, you wind up doing away with swamps. And when you do away with swamps where are the children going to play? - Vicious cycle. - You see. - Lf you say so. One last question. - Yes, indeed. How are you coming along collecting those 5,000 names that you need to get on the ballot? At this very moment, two top members of my staff are busily Here they are now. - Back so soon. - And why not? In two hours of tramping around we got more than 20,000 names. And a lot of blisters. Does that answer your question, my good man? Yes, sir. Don't forget the campaign slogan. Yes. "Gomez Addams. Watch his smoke. " Catchy, isn't it? Everybody's getting into the campaign. Even I smoke occasionally. - My, he's in a hurry. - Probably has to make a deadline. Nice man. He just doesn't seem to know much about politics. I know all that, but who are you going to vote for? Who am I going to vote for? Well, I'll tell you. This Addams guy says he's for slums, swamps, smog, and the African tsetse fly. Sounds kind of nutty, doesn't he? Nutty? Nutty like a fox. It's a rib. Don't you get it? Sure. He's teeing off with these politicians that make promises they know they're never going to keep. - I'm voting for the Addams guy. - Same here. How about you? I'm going to the nearest bar and get smashed. - I can't believe it! - Here are the actual figures, sir. According to all the polls Addams is pulling out in front of you. - But what do you suggest? - A debate on TV. A debate on TV? Addams is a kook. Get him on the air and prove it. Look, we'll have the studio audience loaded with ringers, stacked questions. Booing in all the right places. Of all the mean, low-down conniving tricks Well, what are you standing there for? Go and arrange it. Fortune cookie. Don't look now but there's a telephone call for you. Thank you, Thing. Hello? Good morning, Mayor. A debate? I'd love to. How's this for a theme? "Resolved that boys and girls should not go steady until" What? Oh, the political issues. Isn't that a bit extreme? Very well, we'll do it your way. Fine. I'll see you then. - Morticia. - You called? The Mayor and I are going to debate on television. Oh, darling, do you think you should? Why not? Some television producer might see me. Open up a whole new career for me. Oh, by the way, the Mayor is coming over tomorrow morning to issue a formal challenge. He's bringing along some reporters to make sure I don't weasel out. Me, weasel out? That's not a bad idea. Darling, television has been the waterloo of many an aspiring candidate. But don't you worry, we'll have you perfectly rehearsed and ready. Counselor in my despair, shining beacon in my darkest moments. Maybe it will be better to weasel out. No, the Addams family honor is at stake. The very words of Lafayette Addams. When he challenged the Duke of Burgundy to a duel? Just before he skipped out of town. Now, darling, I want the public to see the real Gomez Addams. Oh, very well. No, I don't think that's quite good for your public image. - Hang from the chandelier? - Just smile, dear. Very sweet. Now, dear, I want to make sure we get your best side. How about this? - No, that's no good. - Like this? No, that's no good, either. Morticia, how's this? This is his best side. No, I believe facing the camera is a bit more customary. Well, I can bring the camera around here. No, dear, let's try that. By george, Morticia, you are a resourceful director. - Now, we need a little makeup. - Makeup. Oh, Uncle Fester, you only got one side. That Lafayette Addams was no fool. Darling, the minute you get on the air, I want you to square your shoulders, set your jaw, and put on your glasses, it makes you look so impressive. Yes, that's it. And I'll insist that the camera zoom in for a big head close-up. Yes, my dear. Let's try it, yes. Now, stare. That's it. Close-up. That was just a wee bit too close. But you're getting it, darling. I've gotten it. Gomez, I was just going to test my new guillotine. Would you like Fester, don't you know I'm going to debate the Mayor? Can't you see I'm wrestling with major issues? Major who? Labor, foreign policies, social security. Yeah, what do you think should be done about them? That's what I was going to ask you. You're no help at all. Nothing but interruptions and distractions. Uncle Fester, I want you to taste my new recipe. Braised lion loins. Say, that is tasty. Something is the matter with Gomez. He doesn't even want to play with my guillotine. He has been acting strangely. I'd better give this my personal attention. Fourscore and nine years ago No. Fourscore and ten years ago That doesn't sound right, either. - Oh, bubele. - Good morning, my dear. Gomez, darling, I called you bubele. The world will little note, nor long remember No. Gomez, dear, would you like a little snack, some pâté de foie gras? Crepes suzettes? Gomez? Friends, Romans, countrymen That's it! Morticia, what happened? It's even worse than you thought. It all started when he began running for mayor. Oh, dear, sweet, kind Gomez. I've turned him into a Frankenstein. There is a resemblance. I can't interfere now. Oh, yes, I can. I forced him into this race and I'll force him out for his own good. - How? - I'll need some cooperation. - You can count on me. - Me, too. Oh, dear, sweet Thing. Not only do I accept the challenge of a television debate, but I refuse to sink to the level of this corrupt old windbag and engage in any name-calling. Mama! I'm sorry I can't stick around, son, but I'll never get these office floors scrubbed just sitting here on my bucket. Well, I'm off to my job. Job? I didn't even know you had a mop. Just one moment, madam. Did I understand you to say that Gomez Addams is your son? Sure, has been for years. Oh, thank you. If you bring it back I'll autograph it for you. Well, gentlemen, did you hear that? And this is the man who asks you to elect him to the high office of mayor of our fair city. And who forces that old, gray-haired mother of his to scrub office floors. What do you have to say to that, sir? There's a perfectly simple explanation. I just can't think of it. Meaning, of course, that you are not going to help. Of course I'm going to help her. I'm going to get her a new mop. That old one did look pretty scruffy. Gomez, I just had to see you! It has been hours, hasn't it? I'm really touched. Say, I like your new outfit. Who's your tailor? Never mind that. I just wanted you to know you'd get my vote if I had one. They'll never take me alive. Who was that? Oh, that's Uncle Fester, the family Beau Brummell. Off to the races, from the looks of the outfit he was wearing. I'm leaving that beast and no one can stop me. - What happened? - What happened? You know what happened, you wife-beater. And you gentlemen of the press, if you know your job, you'll splatter this all over the front pages. And as for you, when the public finds out what a vile fiend you really are it'll be curtains for you. The end. Tish, that's French. And when they find out that you're also a scoundrel and a cardsharp and a vain, self-centered, sweet, kind, beautiful And a vote for Gomez Addams is a vote for clean government! Well, gentlemen, I hope you will give this story the treatment it deserves. - We will. And it'll be a landslide. - Well, thank you. An Addams landslide. - Addams landslide? - Get with it, Mayor. This is the absolute tops in satire on dirty politics, mud-slinging and character assassination. Addams is even getting my vote. - What'll I do? - Concede. - What? - You're all washed-up anyway. There'll be other elections and the crowd loves a good loser. A new political star has risen. Gentlemen, I give you His Honor, Gomez Addams. - Gomez? - Yes. - Do you really like this outfit? - Oh, yes. Not now, Uncle Fester. Please, dear. What were you saying? Well, the people have spoken when they first rushed to sign that original petition. - That's silly. - What's silly? Well, where we got those names from, no one was rushing or speaking. Uncle Fester, where did you get those names? The Happy Rest Cemetery. Right off the headstones. - Cemetery? - Yeah. Addams, I'm afraid that disqualifies you, old boy. Better luck next time. Oh, Gomez, darling, I'm dreadfully sorry. I feel personally responsible for all of this. Can you ever forgive me? - I doubt it. - Bubele. So help me, if I live to be a thousand, I'll never, never forgive you. What is it, darling? I simply must know how I'd have fared as Mayor. Statesmanship, leadership, initiative, intelligence and ability. - Don't forget good looks, dear. - Right, good looks. Darling, is "impeachment" good? "Chaos, mismanagement, corruption?" Well, in that case, impeachment would be the best thing. Who wants to be mayor of a bankrupt city? You withdrew just in time, darling. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family How exciting. Look at them go! This is going to be the greatest train wreck in railroad history. I'm gonna switch them onto the same track. Watch! Wonderful. Darling, you have such a way with trains. -I suppose so. -Weren't you happy with it? I thought it was your finest wreck. Perhaps it was. But I've just realized, if you wreck one train, you wreck them all. Sometimes I almost wish they'd miss each other. Gomez, what a shocking thought. Maybe we've just gotten into a rut. We do seem to be doing the same things over and over again. -Our morning stroll through the swamp. -Fencing across the lunch table. Darling, why don't you come and have a nice hot cup of henbane? It'll soothe your nerves. MORTlClA: Thank you, Thing. -Darling. -Thank you. Darling, maybe we should take a trip somewhere. Tombstone or Death Valley. Some fun place. Perhaps. Good morning, darling. Would you like a bite? Chew your food. No, no. Cleopatra, you'll spoil your lunch. Darling, maybe we should have some people in. That nice Mr. Harris. He always seemed to enjoy himself here. That would be pleasant, but I'm afraid Mr. Harris won't have the time for us any longer. Did you see the paper this morning? No, darling, I haven't read the paper yet. He has a new job working for the government. "Foreign diplomats visiting our city. Roger L. Harris to conduct tour for VlPs. " There's a picture. MORTlClA: They certainly seem to be enjoying the tour. Well, I hope you'll enjoy the places we're going to see today, gentlemen. We will not enjoy. Frankly, Washington is quite upset about your lack of enthusiasm so far. So? They seem to blame me for it. If I fail to give you a good impression of our country, well Oh, it'll mean the axe for me. -Miri Haan, take note. -Note I take. If guide fails assignment, Washington masters will chop off head. Naturally. No, I don't mean they'll chop my head off. I mean they'll fire me. -And then set fire to him. -Destroy evidence. Gentlemen, look, you take our language too literally. For two days now your Washington masters have shown us phony tour. They only show us what they want us to see. You do not show us the real America. The downtrodden masses slaving under bureaucratic whip. We want to see the people. The real peoples! Peoples. All right. All right, anything you say. You can see anybody you want to. Good. We choose honest way. By chance. We stick pin into phone book. Wherever pin strikes we go. -All right with me. -Miri Haan, phone book. I'll get a pin. -We use our own pin. -Always. Eeny, meeny, miney, boom! What's the matter, Tish? Something wrong? That's strange. I felt just as though I'd been stuck with a pin. The Addams. Oh, no, no, they aren't They're off limits. Excuse me, sir. Please don't go in there. A-ha! -Guide begs us not to go in. Why? -Why? Because we have found real American family, not phony bureaucratic setup. -That's not so. -And government -will chop off his head for this. -Poor fellow. Come. We go see some real Americans. Look, fellows, I know where there's a dandy little bar downtown with beautiful dancing girls. You'll have a ball there. A-ha! Miri, take note. Guide tries to bribe us but we refuse. We are strong men. We go later. Now we go see typical American family. -Very interesting. -I take note. Mrs. Addams, you have a very interesting house here. I have seen nothing like it before in America. Well, it's nothing out of the ordinary, but we like it. MORTlClA: And I'm so glad you gentlemen could come. You've brightened our day immensely. Harris, it was very nice of you to bring them here. -Well, it wasn't my idea -He was very eager for us to meet average American family, is not so, Mr. Harris? I keep telling you! The Addams are not an average family at all. -How sweet. -Don't be turning our heads with flattery. I do wish I'd known you were coming. I could've planned some sort of amusement. Oh, no, please. We wish to observe everyday routine. Agreed? MORTlClA: Whatever you wish. Psst. Our house is your house, gentlemen. Mr. Haan, may I offer you a cigar? Here, have one. I will save for later. Let's join the conversation. Psst. Mr. Haan, sit down. -Miri Haan, you're smoking. -Oh, no, I save for later. Mr. Haan, I'm terribly sorry. I should've warned you it was a live cigar. I begged you not to come here in the first place. Well, gentlemen, we'd better be running along. I'm sure you've seen enough. -And I think -We send this back home to laboratory. I had no idea it was so late. If you gentlemen will excuse me, it's time to go feed my plants. Yes, they get pretty cranky when they're hungry. Plants? Plants get hungry? Cranky? Well, after all, they're only human. I'm quite proud of Mrs. Addams' hothouse. She's raised these plants from tiny weeds. Darling, would you? Gardening is all a matter of proper feeding. And these plants just love meat. -Meat? -Especially when it's medium rare. Yes, they're really meat eaters. I've seen them. Especially that one. It's a regular little glutton. Oh, no, no, no. Cleopatra, really. Mr. Harris was only joking, darling. She's really a sweet little thing. She's terribly young. Not very S-M-A-R-T. But she's learning. Open up, sweetheart. Have some more. There. Yes. This is plant, not animal? -And it is learning? -She's quite slow, actually. She's three years old and she can't even feed herself yet. Open up, sweetheart. Excuse me. -This is big thing we have discovered. Big. -Very big. They've learnt to breed plants that have the intelligence of humans. And a mere woman has done this. An American woman. Perhaps they have gone further than this? And Harris thought he could hide this from us. It's all right. We will learn the truth. Take notes, Miri Haan. Plenty notes. Plenty notes. Plenty notes. The mail's in. Thank you, Thing. -What is that? -Just your imagination. Don't let him pull your leg. Thing is as real as any of us. Thing, come up and meet our guests. Thing. Now, now. Dear Thing, he doesn't know his own strength. -Anything exciting in the mail, dear? -Oh yes, lots of bills. Wonderful. Will you excuse us, please? Is it real? Muscle and bone, with a grip like iron. They have made this. A hand, a single hand by itself. -lt likes privacy. -This is fantastic. Take notes, Miri Haan. Take notes. American family has taken first step towards building robots. First a plant that moves and thinks and then a hand of flesh and blood. This is big. -Very big. -Bigger than big. I write everything down. Everything. Beautiful wreck, isn't it? -Beautiful wreck? -Beautiful wreck? Hello, I didn't know you were having company. This is our Uncle Fester. This is Mr. Klarpe and Mr. Haan. -Of course, you know Mr. Harris. -Howdy. -I guess this'll have to wait. -What'll wait, old boy? Well, I was feeling a little run down and I just wanted to get myself recharged. -Recharged? -Recharged? -It's just an expression. -This is an expression, too? Oh, no, this is a great little pepper-upper. Would you like to see it work? Uncle Fester, I'm sure these gentlemen wouldn't be interested. No. We'd be very interested. Good. Well, you'll have to crank it, Gomez. -He's such an exhibitionist. -FESTER: Oh, no. I really am run down. It's just a simple little treatment to build up his energy. Yes, well, you see, I put this little wire in my ear. This little generator does the rest. Go ahead, Gomez. -He really gets a charge out of this. -Write, write. You mean he is full of electricity? Believe me, believe me, they're just playing a little joke on you. It's a joke, huh? Touch. -That's a funny joke. -Write! Write! I'm writing, I'm writing right now. Stop! Stop! Stop it. I'm sorry, Harris, but he did warn you. It'll tingle for a while but then it'll wear off. I feel so good now, I'm gonna go out and chase automobiles. Wonderful hobby. Stay away from water, Uncle Fester. The last time he was recharged he took a shower and blew out every fuse in the house. -Americans, in order to get energy -Energy. -put electricity in ear. -Ear. -Like vitamins in stomach -Stomach. -which we invented. -Which we invented. That reminds me, would you gentlemen care to join us in a snack? -Oh, no, no, really. -We stay. -We stay. -Excellent. I'll ring for Lurch. -This Lurch, is he servant? -Yes, he's our butler. Finally, we are to meet downtrodden member of the American slave class. Poor, weak victim of exploitation. It is strong bell. You rang? Lunch, Lurch. And, oh, yes, Lurch, a cigar, please. Thank you, Lurch. Would you gentlemen care for a cigar? -Oh, no, no, no. -No, no, thank you. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll get Mrs. Addams. Thank you, Lurch. That is poor, weak slave? -Miri Haan, take note. -Take note. -Servant of typical American family, robot. -Robot. -Wait a minute, that's not true. -ls true. -Third stage. -Third stage? What are you talking about? Simple. First stage plant, second stage hand, final product human robot. Flood labor market. -Flood labor market. -This is ridiculous. Lurch is no robot. -Then what is he? -Well, he's a I don't know exactly, but you'll never find another one like it. How could be? Is typical American family. Typical! I keep telling you. It's the only one of its kind. -Please, let's get out of here. -Still trying to hide from us truth. You still trying to pull bourgeois wool over our eyes. I do hope you gentlemen enjoyed our modest table. Was very good. Most thoughtful of you to serve caviar in our honor. -Caviar? -The black fish eggs on toast. Very good. Oh, you mean eye of tadpole? Eye of tadpole? Blue-eyed tadpole is even tastier than black-eyed tadpole but it's off-season for blue-eyed tadpole. Beef is good, too. Not as good as in our country, but is good. Mr. Haan, that wasn't beef. That's breast of alligator. Alligator? How about that henbane sauce? Specialty of the house. Shall we repair to the living-room, gentlemen? -You have been marvelous hostess. -Thank you. -Very nice. -Very nice. No sense in wasting this. Tristan and lsolde love alligator. Told you. Care to make a wish? Mother, I finished my Oh. Company. Gentlemen, this is our son, Pugsley. Now, young man, what brought you racing in here so unceremoniously? -I've finished my disintegrator gun. -Well, that's nice, dear. -Run outside and play. -Would you like to see it work, sir? I'm sure these gentlemen have no time to No, no, no. Let's not disappoint the little fellow. -So you build disintegrator gun, eh? -That's right. You mean you point disintegrator at something, pull trigger, and that something disappear? That's right, sir. Watch. You mean you just point it I think you'd better play with this outside, Pugsley. -It's rather hard on the bric-a-brac. -Yes, Father. Nice to have met you, sir. Poor Mr. Harris. Little things upset him so. Very high-strung. I'll have Lurch take care of him. You rang? Yes. Lurch, would you take Mr. Harris to the guest room? He needs a bit of rest. Oh, please, I don't need anything, l Come. Very hospitable. Never mind that. The little fellow, he made that gun himself? He just can't keep out of mischief. Remember the anti-gravity machine he made, and what happened when he turned it on the postman? Oh, yes, that was amusing. The mailman just went floating off up in the air. He really hated to come down. He said the floating was so much easier on his feet. He needs to rest. Well, be my guest. I just had the whole thing sharpened. -Oh, no, no. -Or maybe you'd prefer the iron maiden? These spikes will help you keep nice and still. It's very restful. I don't need any rest, I'm fine. Please just put me down. All right. That'll be all, Lurch. You know, Mr. Harris, there is an art in relaxing. Well, I'll never master it in this menagerie. I almost got wiped out by a ray gun. That Pugsley. Such a showoff. That's how we lost Cousin Creep. There he was, giggling and laughing and suddenly there he wasn't, still giggling and laughing. It was kind of eerie. But that was old Creepy. He could always take a joke. Well The impression those two men are getting in this house, it could disrupt international relations. I did think they were getting a little bored. What if I was to go in and do some parlor trick? I can saw a woman in half. -Oh, no, no, no. -Oh, yes. It goes The only trouble I have is getting her together again. Very strange man. That is restful. I'm very worried. This is not what we expected. How can you expect what is so unexpected? We thought average Americans were fools. Now we learn they are geniuses. -MlRl: Dangerous geniuses. -Electricity and eerie robots. Ray guns built by little boys already. I will make full report. From now on, we must learn to respect all Americans. Is not safe to offend these people. Is not safe. Rather be friend than meet end. Well, gentlemen, have you found out all you want to know -about us typical Americans? -We have. Though you try hard to keep us from learning truth. I was just doing my duty. -Now we say goodbye to our hosts. -Oh, yes, let's get moving. -I just made $100,000. -Really? How nice. Oops, just lost it again. C'est la guerre. Tish, when you speak French you drive me wild. Excuse me, gentlemen. Gomez, darling, control yourself. I think perhaps we better leave. Very thoughtful. We wish to thank you for a most enlightening day. You've brightened our day, too. We were about to settle down to our everyday routine. No notes. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. You know, darling, I've been thinking. The simple life is really the best. You're right. Uncle Fester, are you sure this'll help you get rid of your headache? Keep going. -That's it. -Good. Darling, you look so serene and happy when you're throwing knives. Family trait. Thank you, Thing. Hello, this is Mrs. Addams speaking. Why, hello, Mr. Harris. Really? Well, how nice of you to call. Goodbye. Gomez, that was that nice Mr. Harris. He says our guests have cut their trip short and have gone home to make a full report. -Well, that's too bad. -Oh, no. Mr. Harris says he's glad they're gone. He said he overheard them talking about taking Lurch with them for scientific purposes. Scientific purposes. The things people will do to get a good servant. Most ungracious. Let's not give them another thought. Back to our own beautiful world.

Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Tish! That sets my Spanish blood aflame. Bubele, please. Bubele. That sets the rest of my blood aflame. One, two, fat go away. Three, four, muscles stay. Pugsley, darling, what are you doing? Exercising. She called me fatso. She? My girl, Marie. She said she wasn't going to go with me anymore unless I got some muscles. Muscles? Oh, how vulgar. Morticia, Gomez. Hey, Morticia, Gomez. What do you know, I just got a letter from my French pen pal, Yvette. - And she says - Uncle Fester. Please, dear, not now. Later. We have a little problem. We caught the boy exercising. Well, what's wrong with that? Girls like guys with V-figures. The only trouble is, mine's upside-down. Now, Pugsley, dear, a man's charm comes from inner strength. Not from outer bulges. Look at your father, did you ever see a better example of inner strength? And the whole thing without a single push-up, pull-up, sit-up, sweat-up. The entire thing accomplished through the sheer glory of Zen-Yogi. Zen-Yogi has made your father what he is today. That plus the sheer beauty of his soul. Darling. Let's have no more talk of biceps and triceps. If you want to be a really attractive man, do as your father does. Okay, Mother, I'll try. Darling. Oh, just look at him. Gaining inner strength. Inner strength and a flat head. Fester, don't knock anything until you've really tried it. How true, darling. Now, Uncle Fester, your letter from Yvette. Oh, forget it. Gomez, darling, did you hear something? Just a thump. Seems to be coming from Fester's room. I wonder what he's up to. He'll be coming through the ceiling in a minute, we can ask him. I have a better idea. You rang? Yes, Lurch. Would you go upstairs and check on Uncle Fester? There seems to be a lot of thumping going on up there. Yes, Mrs. Addams. You thumped. Oh, Lurch. I'm in terrible shape. So I see. Remember my French pen pal, Yvette? Folies-Bergere. She's coming here to visit me. You can say that again. She thinks that I'm 6'3" and built like Cary Grant. Well, it's not that bad. I've got a couple of days to get in shape. But Zen-Yogi isn't gonna do it. Corset? Corset! 'Course not. No. I'm gonna go on a crash program of diet and exercise, but secret. - Secret? - Yeah. You know how Gomez and Morticia feel about exercise. They think it's silly. I'll have to do it early in the morning. Hey, I'll do it with that guy on TV, Jack La Lanne. The muscle man. He's on at 6:50 in the morning. What are you moaning about? I'm the one that's gotta get up and do it! One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Come on, ladies, hit it. One, two, three, four. One Tummies in. Shoulders back, squat. Hit it. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Come on, one, two, - three, four - What is he doing? He's either dancing to The Late Late Show or exercising to The Early Early Show. One, two, three, four. Hi. Isn't that Jack La Lanne, the physical culture fellow? Never heard of him. Gomez. That television set goes back to the junk man. Good thinking. Hey. I can't get you on TV anymore, so I decided on a personal approach. I need help. You know, you said it was an emergency and it certainly is. You know, I've seen people let themselves go. But you're almost gone. Touché! Morticia. Isn't that that television fellow with Uncle Fester? I do believe it is. That's odd having him here. Fester's up to something. Darling, have you ever known Uncle Fester to be sneaky and underhanded? Only when he was up to something shady. Say, what do you generally eat? Oh, the usual thing. Eye of newt. Purée of aardvark. Roast yak. You know, they say we're what we eat. And, mister, you really are. Look, it's all in this booklet. This is the astronaut's guide. And whatever it calls for in here goes double for you. Roger. Four, three, two, one. Blast off. Boy, this exercise makes you thirsty. Turn it off! Well, now. A little punching the bag. Well, I've stopped punching the bag. Now, what's the next exercise in that astronaut book that La Lanne gave me? Deep knee-bends. Deep knee-bends. All right, you count. We'll start with about 50. One. Down. More. I got down all right. You've got to get me up. Oh, boy. Listen to those muscles expand. Well. That's enough deep knee-bends. What's the next exercise? Chest pulley. That will be a snap. Thank you. Must be stuck. Yeah. I think I got the hang of it now. Sure. Well, don't just stand there, help me. Now I got the idea. Let me have it. My, he was in a hurry. Lurch, we know we can count on you. What's troubling Fester? I think he's trying to tell us something. Is he in trouble? He's beginning to weaken. Is it a money matter? An emotional disturbance? A health problem? We're getting warm. A health problem. Darling, you're right. Uncle Fester's ill. Of course, that's it. It's written all over his face. Just had to keep probing. Thank you, Lurch. Thank you for being so helpful. Uncle Fester, what are you doing? Relaxing. Fester, old boy. Your problem is solved. It is? Yes, we're going to have a doctor here for you in an hour. - This is the Addams house? - Yep. You're going in there? Good luck, Charlie. I'm Doctor Motley. Follow me. Doctor Motley. Just a moment, Doctor, where are you going? I am going to nail up a quarantine sign. I can tell just by looking at you, there's an epidemic in this house. Really, Doctor, there's no need for hysterics. Only one of us is sick. - Which one? - Uncle Fester, of course. Just hasn't been himself. Oh, I'm not sick. I just had a complete physical examination. Blood pressure, perfect. Pulse, perfect. Reaction time, perfect. Liver, so-so. So-so? Well, you can't win them all. Who performed this examination? I did. It may not be perfect, but it saves a lot of time. Fester, where are you going? Up to my room to sharpen my scalpel. - Your scalpel? - Yes. If my liver count keeps dropping, I may have to operate. Uncle Fester. As long as Doctor Motley is here, how about an examination? Oh. Need the practice, hey, Doc? If it weren't for my Hippocratic oath, I'd turn in my satchel. You see anything, Doctor? Yes, I see a face with pince-nez glasses. Fester's head? Either in or Let's try it from another angle. Do you still see that face, Doctor? No, now I see a moose's head. By george, Fester always did like to keep an open mind. You know what I think? Don't tell me you think he has holes in his head. I think you all have holes in your head. And that includes me. Poor fellow. Those long internships do take their toll. Poor Uncle Fester. How a man can go to pieces right before your very eyes. Not only did he pass up lunch and dinner, but look at him. Staring at the full moon and doing deep knee-bends. Oh, dear, he is sick. Usually when the moon is full, he howls at it. Darling. You don't suppose his problem could be mental. Possible. Greater minds than his have been known to crack. Remember Cousin Slump? Yes. One moment, a brilliant nuclear physicist. The next, he was running around Los Alamos in a three-cornered hat and a powdered wig. Dear. Darling, perhaps I should call a psychiatrist? Querida, after our experience with Dr. Motley? You're right. I'll handle this myself. Do you remember how much I helped you with your sleepwalking? You mean to analyze him? We must reach his subconscious. Be lucky to reach his conscious. Darling, we have to try and help him. But how? There are ways. Now, Uncle Fester. I want you to concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate. Morticia, you're just wasting your time. The only one that can hypnotize me is me. Now, watch. Sleep. Certainly doesn't waste time on preliminaries. Yes, but I think we ought to make sure he's really out. Test his reflexes. - Reflexes? - Yeah. With a hammer, you know. Oh! Oh, of course. By george, he's really under. Now, Uncle Fester. I want you to listen very carefully. First question. You've been up to something lately, haven't you? Yes. - Would you care to tell us about it? - No. Uncle Fester. Tell us. What's going through your poor tortured mind at this very moment? Four, three, two, one. Blast off! So that's it. What's it? We know now why Uncle Fester has been doing - all this ridiculous exercising and dieting. - We do? Of course. He wants to become an astronaut. That's wonderful, the first Addams in space. A proud moment, isn't it? No, it isn't. We can't let him go. - Why not? - He's DC. District of Columbia? Direct current. Put DC Fester in the AC space capsule, and Nothing left of Fester but a plump asteroid. How courageous. Willing to blow himself for science. A true Addams. He'd set the space program back 20 years. We must save him from his brave folly. - But first we better wake him up. - Oh, yes. Uncle Fester? Uncle Fester. Oh, what we do now? - You're gonna hit him with that? - Most certainly not, dear. Oh, how horrible. I dreamed I was swimming the English Channel and halfway across I sank. No use trying to conceal it. I need more exercises. Hello, Houston? This is Morticia Addams and I'd like to speak to the head of your astronaut program. He's asleep? Well, wake him, wake him. This is a citizen calling. If he could see you in all your loveliness, he'd pop out of bed in a minute. Hello? Hello, General. This is Morticia Addams. Now, I don't mean to be critical, but I do think you're going a bit far in drafting Uncle Fester for your next Gemini shot. Well, not that he isn't willing to go, of course. But we do feel Yes. Yes, I do know you have a moon shot in the morning. But that's no reason to lure plump, happy earthlings like Uncle Fester away. Now, now, now. General. That kind of language will not solve any problem. I General? What did he say? I think the phone went dead. Morticia. Look. Good heavens! The General's language must have burned up the phone wires. Things have come to a pretty pass when a man can't have any privacy in his own steam cabinet. Uncle Fester, you can stop this ridiculous exercising. You've been released from the astronaut program. What astronaut program? Ours, of course. Unless you sold out to the Russians. Boy, are you off-base. I'm doing this for my pen pal, Yvette. Exercising for a pen pal? Sure. She's from the Folies-Bergere. And she's gonna come over here and visit me. And when she gets here, I'm gonna be real trim and sexy. Miss Yvette. Already? Oh, she can't see me like this. Nonsense. Fester, old man, you have to go upstairs and face the music. Oh, not with this body. Perhaps she'll love you for your soul. Well, that's even fatter. Come on. Lurch. Where's our visitor from overseas? In the conservatory. Oh, please show her in. Yes, Mrs. Addams. You know, Morticia, when she sees me, a great postal romance is going right down the drain. Brace up, Uncle Fester. She'll love you for what you are. All of it. Yvette? Of course, chéri, and you must be Fester. What an interesting couple. They're almost an interesting quartet. But I thought you were with the Folies-Bergere. I am, I take care of the costumes. Oh, no wonder she's putting on weight. If she takes care of the costumes at the Folies-Bergere, she doesn't have much to do. In your letter to me, you said to go on a diet. Of course, chéri. But to gain weight, not to lose it. You are nothing but skin and bones. Not my type at all. Yvette, you spoke French! Of course, chéri. What do you expect from a French girl, Hungarian? That's an interesting point. Well, I must hurry, my cab is waiting. Keep writing, chéri. Well, if you can't believe in the Folies-Bergere, what's left for a fella? Well, one good thing, Fester, now you can stop all that ridiculous exercise and dieting. Take my advice. Put your money on Zen-Yogi. Hey! I did it. Well, how handsome you both look. As Grandpa Squint Addams used to say about Cousin Blob, two heads are better than one. That junk man, really a gem, offering me money to take the set back. I'm glad it's back. These moon shots are so exciting. Yes. They do stir up the old corpuscles. Darling, that missile. Why is its tail wagging? Oh, I hate to tell you this, querida, but you've tuned in on Rin Tin Tin. There. That's it. Fester, is anything wrong? Need a little recharging, that's all. What's going on? You're just in time for the moon shot. Oh, that. I went through that whole astronaut booklet from cover to cover. I could have gone up in that rocket. I even volunteered to. But it's not what you know, it's who you know. I think they're getting ready for the countdown. - Five. Four. Three. - Five. Four. Three. - Two. One - Two. One. Blast off. That's the Addams determination. If I know Fester, he'll catch up. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family These conventions, they're so exciting! I remember the first time I voted. 1906. Now, Mama, you know there was no woman suffrage in 1906. -That didn't stop me. -You're a real Addams. What's all the noise? The conventions, Morticia, the conventions. I do wish they wouldn't shout so. It keeps Iittle Pugsley's octopus awake. The poor thing's getting rings under his tentacles. And my African strangler, too. It just Ioses all desire to strangle anyone. Thank you, Thing. Dear Thing. It sets such a good example for us. Show-off. -Uncle Fester! -I'm sorry. Now, you know I don't Iike petty jealousies. Where's Gomez? He's down in the playroom hanging pictures. Oh, dear. I do hope he isn't hanging the picture of Cousin Grisly facing the firing squad down there. It Iooks so right in the hall. What are you doing, darling? Just getting the playroom into the election spirit. Is he running again? No, but I thought I'd bring out the pictures of the men we Addamses have supported in the past. Very appropriate. -We really backed Landon to the hilt. -Yes. I must say he was a very good Ioser. No better than AI Smith here. Or Wendell Willkie. Or Adlai. Uncle BIight masterminded their campaigns. OId "Kiss-of-Death" BIight, they called him. I never quite knew why. Grandpa Squint says it's an old family nickname. Grandpa knew his way around the political arena, too. Abe Lincoln begged him for his support. But there's the man who got it. Stephen Douglas. Darling, with all this natural political talent, shouldn't you be running for public office? No, we Addamses prefer to think of ourselves as king-makers. The man I've decided to throw my support to, in every way, is Leonard G. Quimby. -Howdy, neighbor. -How do you do? -Well, I see you've picked your man. -Yes, I have. Even heard you made a substantial contribution to his campaign. It's only money. Good. -George Bass is my name. -Addams here. -Is all this yours? -Well, we go back to the cemetery. We all do, sometime. It's nice to see citizens taking an interest in the election, even if they have backed the wrong man. Quimby? Why, he's our insurance man. Got us off the hook when my son, Pugsley, accidentally blew up the garage. But that's neither here nor there. You're right. My man promises to modernize the city, put in more streetlights, drain the swamps. -Drain the swamps? -That and more. Well, maybe I have been a Iittle hasty. -Do you have a picture of your man? -Do I have a picture of my There he is, the voice of progress. That's Sam L. Hilliard. Why, he's an old friend. I hope the L stands for Lucifer. -It does, it does. -Good. He's a fine man. Last time he was around here, he went away with the shakes. I wonder why. Overworked. Then you'II vote for him? We'II do better than that. We'II go out and campaign for him. Wonderful! Wait till I tell Mr. Hilliard. Here. Welcome, fellow campaigner. Sorry, Quimby. You can sprinkle Iater, Tish. Take a Iook at this. -I could have sworn he was bald. -My dear. That's another man. That's our old friend from the School Board, Sam L. Hilliard. I've changed horses in midstream. -That's the Addams way. -Of course. The L stands for Lucifer. Very appropriate for a politician. But, darling, Iook at his platform. "Modernize the city, put in more streetlights, "drain the swamps! " Drain our Iovely swamps? -The man's an extremist. -querida mia, our swamps are safe. Mr. Hilliard won't do any of those terrible things. Don't you realize politicians always make extravagant promises? Fortunately I can see through their Iittle games. Darling, you're so clever. I'm sure Mr. Hilliard will be very happy we've decided to join his campaign. I can just see his face. No, no, no. I want no part of that Addams family. But they're good for a nice campaign contribution. You get it. Look, the public Iikes personal contact with the candidate, you know, the old handshake, the baby kissing. You've got to go over and welcome them officially. I'd rather Iose. You may, if you don't Iay your hands on some more campaign funds. -Seriously? -Seriously. It's still not worth it. Community pride, public service, civic duty. I wonder if we're doing the right thing. Don't you want to save our Iovely swamps? That is a good cause. -Besides, elections are fun. -We should vote more often. How's this one? That's nice, Uncle Fester, and very original, too. -Yours is nice too, my dear. -Thank you, darling. -You Ieft the R out of "friend. " -I thought it Iooked better that way. By Jove, it does. I wonder why Mr. Hilliard hasn't called to thank us for joining his campaign. Busy, no doubt. That reminds me. I think I'II send Lurch over and invite Hilliard to a Iittle strategy meeting. Our candidate. Welcome. Mr. Hilliard, how nice of you to join us. We've been up nights just planning and planning for you. What are you planning? Show him the wonderful sign you painted for him. "Everybody's fiend?" I didn't think you'd notice. Sit down, Mr. Hilliard, I'II have Lurch serve some refreshments. You rang? -Name it, Mr. Hilliard. Coffee, tea? -Brew? Oh, no, thank you. Won't you sit down, Mr. Hilliard? Mrs. Addams and I would Iike to discuss some campaign strategy with you. Look, I just remembered a speaking engagement. Yes, thank you. Now then, what's the key to every successful political campaign? -Money. -Exactly. -Gomez is such a brilliant strategist. -She really knows me. Sure, sure. Well, why don't you just make out a check for, say, $5,000? -A drop in the bucket. -$10,000? -$20,000 or nothing. -$20,000? We insist. -Well, if you put it that way. -We do. But more important than money is how it's going to be spent. We have some wonderful ideas. -Like that sign? -Better. Well, why don't you just make out a check and Ieave the campaigning to us. But these are sure-fire strategies. Number one: We wanna get our butler, Lurch, on television. We feel he'II appeal to the women's vote. Camera moves in. It's a close-up of Lurch. Lurch expresses himself on the candidacy of Sam L. Hilliard. Animal magnetism. You can't top that. Tell you what? Make it $10,000. Our children can appeal to the junior voters. Junior voters? Kids don't vote. By George, you're right. How about $5,000? Gomez, darling, we'II still have to Iet the children go on television. They'II be so disappointed. Besides, they wrote such brilliant speeches. $2,500. You'II forget all about money when you hear the song that Uncle Fester wrote for you. A campaign song. -$1,000. -Uncle Fester! Uncle Fester, sing your campaign song for Mr. Hilliard. -This will kill you. -Oh, no. You To the harpsichord, Lurch, we're gonna do the song. It's the kind of song that gets you right here. $500. Don't be a hog help clean up the bog Vote for Sam L. Hilliard He'II stick to the issue he may even kiss you So vote for Sam L. Hilliard Honest and fearless Sam L. is peerless He's a man for whom we stump. So don't be a goat and just cast your vote For the pride of our city's swamp Well, what do you think? I think we've got more money than we need. Uncle Fester can do the song with special effects, too. He Iights up. Lights up? Don't worry about the flickering. We'II have him recharged. -I better go. -You haven't seen anything yet. -PIease, I'II give you a Iittle money. -Nonsense. -I'm really unworthy of your support. -Twaddle. I'm a grafter. You mean all your campaign promises are phony? -As a $3 bill. -I got a Iot of $3 bills. I'm not going to do anything about the streetlights. -The streets stay dark and gloomy. -Wonderful. And the bogs and marshes, I'm gonna make them even boggier. Capital! I knew you'd appreciate my Ieveling with you. We do! We do, Mr. Hilliard. I almost forgot the most important thing. Our party mascot! -We don't need a party mascot. -Yes, we do. The Democrats have their donkey, the Republicans have their elephant. -Guess what we have? -I couldn't begin to. We have Kitty cat. Kitty. Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty. Don't frighten the poor dear. I'II send you a Ietter of apology first thing in the morning. -Forgot your hat. -Keep it! Well, it Iooks Iike we backed the right man. No question about it. I'm just sorry about one thing. -What's that, dear? -I forgot to register. "In the course of human events, "there are many moments that try men's souls. "There are moments of crisis, of tragedy, turmoil, "doubt. There are even moments" I've put Kitty to sleep. What does it matter, darling? He doesn't vote, anyway. No, no, it's my speech. Let's go through it. Start at the beginning. -"My friends" -Hold it. That'II never go, dear. -Get right to the issues. -You're right. "One of the major issues of the day is peace. " Well, that's true, dear. But everybody wants peace. -Even Mr. Quimby. -You're right. "And now, to the matter of taxes. "Shall we have high taxes? Or shall we have Iow taxes?" -Isn't that a dangerous position? -You're right. "Which brings us to the question of education" -Nope, much too controversial. -You're right. "AIso the question of social welfare?" "Now we come to the biggest, the most burning issue of the day, "the question of" -You make that out? -"Question of swamps. " Oh, yes. "As to the matter of swamps" Darling, the Iess said about that the better. Very clever, querida, very clever. -"I thank you. " -Well I know what you're going to say. After such an enlightening and courageous speech, I shouldn't thank them, they should thank me. I agree completely. Now, you all know what you're supposed to do? Lurch, you hit the swanky Oak Knoll section. Roger. -Mama? -I get off in the business district. You parade up and down the street with your placard and you blow your bugle. Uncle Fester, is your assignment clear? I sing, Iight up and pass out $3 bills. Remember, the secret word is "dignity. " AII right, Lurch, blast off. Don't they make a fine-Iooking group? Mr. Hilliard is as good as elected. Oak Knoll is in the bag, huh? Great, keep in touch. Well, everything Iooks good so far. Polls say you're a shoo-in. I wouldn't be if I hadn't got rid of that Addams family. -PIease, Iet's not mention them again. -You're right. Now hop on down to the polls and keep an eye on things. Right. -If anything goes wrong, call me. -Right. Boss? Bass. You better get over here to the Fourth Ward. The Addamses are Ioose. ANNOUNCER: As I told you before, ladies and gentlemen, we're speaking to you from the busy intersection ofBroadway and Main. Well, I've seen election campaigns, but this one beats them all. Looks Iike we've done it. Our on-the-spot broadcast today features Wait a minute. There's candidate Sam Hilliard, and he's chasing a campaign runner down the street with a stick! -Isn't that Uncle Fester? -Uncle Yes, he just Iit up! I better return you to our studios KBHL. I'm beginning to see things. Thank you, Mel, and there you see Why would Mr. Hilliard chase Uncle Fester with a stick? Nonsense, dear. Didn't you hear the reporter admit he was seeing things? Of course. Hilliard will probably be along any minute to express his gratitude. Boss, you can't go in there. It's suicide. -That's my mood exactly. -But I've got to get those Addamses off the street or I'm sunk. Well, I'm not going in. That's the first intelligent thing you've said in the entire campaign. Get down to the polls and see what's going on. Right. -Bass. -Boss? Call my mother and tell her not to wait up for me. Good idea. -Hilliard, we've been expecting you. -I should think so. -I'II take your hat. -No, no, no, I'm holding on to it this time. Come on in. -Mrs. Addams -PIease don't say it. I will, too, say it! Mr. Addams and I find expressions of gratitude so embarrassing. Expressions of gratitude? Your election will be our reward. I'm going to turn this whole thing over to a Iawyer. -A Iawyer? -Yes. My card. Gomez is responsible for putting more criminals behind bars than any other man in the United States. You, a prosecuting attorney? Attorney for the defense. Well, I don't need you for my Iawyer and I don't need you for my campaign manager. You see, our man's a politician of the old school. Not only forgets his campaign promises, he forgets his campaigners. I knew we backed the right horse. Excuse me. Thank you, Thing. Addams here. Yes, he's here too. It's for you. Probably your opponent, Quimby, conceding the election. -Only a case of election day jitters. -I hope so. -Why don't you answer it? -You answer it. Of course, old boy. Addams here. I'II take the message. Oh, hello, Bass! Really? Some of the first returns are in. Oak Knoll, eh? Good. I see. Good work, Bass. -It's a Iandslide. -For Hilliard? For Quimby. 76 to nothing. -I knew it, I knew it. -Those early returns. Of course, the Oak Knoll section, upper class snobs, always contrary to the main trend. I'II get it. Thank you, Thing. Darling, you Iook a Iittle tired. Why don't you just relax? Hello. This is Mrs. Addams speaking. Yes, he's here. -It's for you again. -I'm not going near that thing. I'II take the message. Oh hello, Mr. Bass. Really? It's the 9th Precinct. Well, that's much better. Hilliard 6, Quimby 1 10. -See? You're beginning to gain. -I'm ruined. Ruined! Come now, Mr. Hilliard, that's the 9th Precinct. Nothing but Iower class people. That's not where your strength is. If that's for me, I don't wanna talk to anybody. Addams here. Bass, what's the word? Come, now, Bass, you can think of another word. I see. Well, the middle class section is the most important. -Fine. -AII right, Iet me have it. -If I were you, I'd demand a recount. -Oh, no. Hilliard 5, Quimby 204. Not bad, really. You only Iost one vote. I'm sure there's been some fraud. Yes, Bass admits it. Too bad they caught him. I'II get it. Hello, Mrs. Addams speaking. Yes, Mr. Quimby. Mr. Hilliard's here. I'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now. What? Mr. Quimby, I'm sure you're mistaken. EIectronic computers do not vote. Mr. Quimby is claiming victory. -Wonderful. -What's wonderful about it? Can't you see, old man? The trap. The Achilles' heel. The Waterloo of every politician. Overconfidence. The poor dear. The sweet smell of success must have been too much for him. I'm so glad you joined the Zen-Yogi society, darling. Right, querida. After a strenuous campaign, at Ieast you can relax. Every man should Iearn to relax this way. It's a wonderful gift. -It says Mr. Hilliard is quitting politics. -Really? -Must be his health. -Must be. Because it says he's thinking of Ieaving town, too. As a matter of fact, it says he's thinking of Ieaving the country. Poor man, I was so sure he'd win. I guess we got into the campaign too Iate. Gomez, I'm afraid we failed. Not according to Quimby. He says if it wasn't for us, he wouldn't have won. What a generous thing to say. Why, thank you, Thing. Maybe we should have gotten Thing into the campaign. No, I guess not. Hello? This is Mrs. Addams speaking. Why, hello, Mr. Hilliard. Really? Isn't that nice. Well, thank you. Goodbye. That was that nice Mr. Hilliard. He says he's glad he lost. The Mayor appointed him head of the School Board. It's a much better position. In that case, I'm proud to have served. Alley-oop! Oop! -Where are you going, darling? -To the playroom. To add Mr. Hilliard to our illustrious collection.

Get a much a zippier ping when it shatters. Darling, that is the good china. Gomez, I think I've had enough. Querida, you've been in a blue funk all day. Perhaps a change of scenery will help. Why don't we go to a drive-in movie? Gomez, darling, why don't you keep your mind on the problem? - It is, it is. - No, dear. I mean my sister Ophelia's problem. Oh, that problem. Poor jilted darling. Her heart must be broken by now. That Montrose makes the fifth man this year to get away from her. Sixth! Humphrey was the fifth. Lucky devil. Gomez! Let's face it. Ophelia may be your older sister, but in the school of romance, I'm afraid she's just a dropout. Well, I admit she is a bit aggressive. But after all, that's because she has so much to give. You can say that again. You remember that fellow Stanislaus she used to date? Well, she gave him a concussion and two broken arms. And they weren't even going steady. Well, a girl must keep up with her judo and her karate. Anyway, I expect her here soon. And while she's staying with us I do think we should try and lighten her burden. I shall be the soul of compassion and understanding. Fester, what are you up to? I'm making you some more skeet targets. Miss Ophelia. Oh, you poor girl, what happened? Montrose didn't like that. Spoilsport. Where is my sweet, gentle sister, Morticia? She said she was gonna arrange lunch. But she may be hiding. Oh, dear brother-in-law, I am the most miserable of people. You've got me there. I think I'll end it all. I'll tell Morticia there will be one less for lunch. Gomez! Suicide on an empty stomach? It's very unhealthy. Ophelia! Uncle Fester, I'm so unhappy. Oh, you poor kid, what happened? Montrose didn't like that. He sure must be a weird one. Darling Ophelia. Oh, Sister Morticia, I'm so bereft. Ophelia, it pains to me to see you so unhappy. What happened? Gomez, dear, this is no time for games. Come, Ophelia, sit down and tell me all about it. But skip the judo. Here you are, Morticia. I hardly know where to begin. Well, suppose you start at the beginning. Gee, Gomez, your shell collection is getting real big. Uncle Fester, please. Go ahead, Ophelia. Well Thank you, Thing. Don't take it so hard, Ophelia. This isn't the first time you've been left holding the bag. Uncle Fester, that will be quite enough! I had the most divine ceremony planned. The canopy was going to be gray wolf bane with accents of water lilies, wilted. You always did have an eye for decorating. We were going to take a three-week honeymoon cruise on the African Queen. By george, the man must be mad, not sticking around for a fun time like that. He didn't even say goodbye. All I got was a telegram saying he was joining the Peace Corps and going to the Arctic Circle. Nice country. Help. That thing had a hurricane building up inside of it. I don't see what's so funny. Pray forgive me, Uncle Fester. It just suddenly occurred to me how much you look like my dear Montrose. In fact, you two could be twins. The Peace Corps. Imagine that precious tub of lard getting into the Peace Corps. A fine way to talk about your uncle! As if the Peace Corps wouldn't jump at a chance to have me join. No, Uncle Fester, Ophelia wasn't talking about you. There may have been certain similarities between you and her description of Montrose. - But I don't think - Sure. If she was laughing at Montrose, she was laughing at me and my chances of getting into the Peace Corps. Well, let me tell you something. There is great big world out there just begging for a chance to use my brains and talent. And to prove it, I am joining the Peace Corps. - I'm - Uncle Fester! I think it's wonderful. - What? This? - Yes. No. No, I mean, your joining the Peace Corps. Maybe you could find my Montrose for me. He's my true, true love. Uncle Fester. Think of all the help you could give to people in other countries. After all, who knows more about building moats and drawbridges than you? Say no more, my dear. An old school chum of mine is a bigwig in Washington. I'll give him a call and get the ball rolling. Congratulations, old man, you're as good as in. Can I look now? I'm dying of curiosity. Not yet. It's you, but something's missing. Did you get my daisies? Oh, yes, especially the ones growing in your head. Beautiful. Oh, hi. I'm making a study schedule for my Peace Corps exams next week, and you girls promised to help me. So, now let's see. I've got from 10:00 to 11:00 open and from 5:00 till 6:00. Which shall I put you down for, Morticia? I feed my plants from 10:00 to 11:00. Oh, dear. I generally weed my head from 10:00 to 11:00. But I guess I could rearrange my day. Okay. Swell! With you girls helping me, I'm a cinch to pass. I feel a weed growing up there. Oh, I'll get it. That's a daisy. Very deep roots. Oh, sorry. There, got it! Thank you, Uncle Fester. You are a dear. Yeah, I guess there's just no use fighting it. You know something, Morticia? That ice really captures Ophelia's warm personality. All right now. "The examination will cover general and specific topics. "And you will be required "to answer questions based on a wide field of knowledge. "Now, the following are typical examples of questions that may be asked. " Are you ready? - Shoot. - All right, here we go. "What is the first aid treatment for a snake bite?" Oh, that's a cinch. You take the snake and wrap him in a nice warm blanket so he won't go into shock. - Right? - It certainly is. But that's not the answer they have here. I can't understand how they'd slip up on a misprint like this. Maybe that's an old book. Try another question. All right. "The Peace Corps mission is to make friends. "Now, what would you do "if you were invited to a feast in a native village "and were served such local delicacies "as sautéed bat wings, "brisket of warthog and sweet and sour scorpion stew?" I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. Whoever heard of mixing sautéed bat wings and brisket of warthog? Ready for the next question, Uncle Fester? Just as soon as I get this nice and tight. And I wanna thank you for taking time off to help me study. There! All right, Wednesday, shoot. "Many of the countries low below the equator "where the average rainfall exceeds "what would you consider the people's greatest need?" Umbrellas. Oh, Uncle Fester. Canoes? Now the swing shift is here. I'll take over, Wednesday. Thank you. Now, Uncle Fester, this is very, very tricky. You have to make sure that all these pegs fit into their proper holes. Oh, yeah, we had one of these things around here before. And you have 45 seconds to do it in. Commence. Oh, yeah. Hey, this is fun. Anything that comes easily is fun, dear. All right. Hey, that's a toughie. Oh, thank you, Thing. Perfect! 45 seconds exactly. However, Thing did help you with that last one. Oh, don't worry. When I take the test, I'll bring my own mallet. I was truly magnificent. I bogeyed the fourth, seventh and ninth holes. I sliced in the quicksand on the 12th. I evaded Mama's alligator on the 14th, and I got a birdie on the 18th. I think it was a hawk. It was flying too high to be sure. Just think, last year you were a rank amateur. It's perseverance. Where's Fester? I haven't seen him around much since he started studying for that Peace Corps exam. He's in training. Dear, dear Uncle Fester, that's what I like. Always one step ahead of me. One step ahead of you? I got one foot in the grave. Now, now. You have to get into the Peace Corps so you can find my Montrose. So, on with our pushups. Now then. "Legs straight, "arms bent at the side, "head down, "246 times. " Oh, that's my mistake. That's the page number. Got to get you nice and firm. Straighten up. And one. We'll have to find some exercises for that ground. It needs firming up, too. Now blow on it first, Cleopatra, it's a very hot pizza. That's mother's baby. Morticia, have you seen Fester? It's time for his vitamin shot. I think he's with Ophelia. You silly girl. You'll get tomato sauce all over his jacket. You know, dear, she really has a thing for you. I think she needs a soul mate. Capital idea. I'll call my office in Nairobi, have them send over a male African strangler. Cleopatra, you're a real flirt. A true Addams. Well, gotta find Fester. Fester! Fester! Fester! Zounds! Looks like I'll have to cut down on the dosage. Addams here. - Washington calling? - Gomez, darling Simpson on the phone from Washington. Just spoke to the Peace Corps about Fester. Simpson, have they decided yet where they want to assign him? Yes. Yes, I see. Well, thanks for the old college try, Simpson. What's the matter, darling? Where are they going to send him? Nowhere. They were impressed. As a matter of fact, the staff psychologist said he wished that Fester would commit himself for five or ten years. Imagine that. Darling, then why aren't they going to send him anywhere? Well, it seems there's no country in the world ready at the present time to accept Fester's talents. Uncle Fester is rather advanced. Oh, dear, this is going to come as quite a blow to Ophelia as well. Well, I'd better tell him now. No sense in him getting into condition for nothing. Wait a minute, darling, I have an idea. You know how proud and independent Uncle Fester is. Yes, he'll be crushed when he finds out they don't need him. Absolutely. So we must make him feel he's more needed here at home. Make it his decision not to go into the Peace Corps. Capital idea! We can't tell Ophelia either. You know how eager she is for him to find her Montrose. I'll talk to her later. Fester won't be difficult. He's a level-headed fellow. And I know just how to handle it. You look a little distressed, Gomez. Going to end it all. Is something wrong? Well, I might as well tell you, Fester, I'm ruined, wiped out. That's impossible! You're worth a fortune. Was, was, Fester. I was worth a fortune. But now I'm just another member of the Great Society. Well, only last week you bought a railroad and an airline and a skateboard factory. Yes, I was known all along Wall Street as the go-go magnate. Now it's all gone, gone, gone, gone! There's only one way, Fester. I can make sure Morticia and the children and the rest of the family will have something. I hope that insurance premium check doesn't bounce. Goodbye, Fester. You can have my trains, blasting caps. Oh, gee, thanks. For a minute there I was sorry to see you go. Fester, Fester, what about the children? Don't worry about them. They can play with the trains all they want. Fester, Fester, children must have a father. There must There must be some way, some way out. Someone, someone with a computer, a computer for a brain. A cold, ruthless financial wizard might turn the tables. Where? Where can I find someone like that? - You're looking at him. - You? It's not for nothing that they call me gold finger. But, gee, that'd mean I'd lose the trains and the blasting caps. I'll buy you the trains and the blasting caps. Well, in that case Morticia, your paintings. May I have a match please? You're gonna burn them? I tried calling the trash man, but he doesn't pick up on Fridays. Well, in that case But, Morticia, these are your masterpieces. They somehow seem so meaningless. I seem to have lost contact with my creative soul. Yeah, so I see. But then, every great painter goes through a dry spell. Yes. If only I had some new challenge. A stimulating model perhaps. A new model? - You found him. - You? Uncle Fester, that's it. Don't move. But, Morticia, I've been so busy helping Gomez get back on his feet. Why, only yesterday I told him to buy, buy, buy. Buy, buy, buy? Yeah, I meant sell, sell, sell. But it was too late. He bought and it went up and You see, he needs me. Oh, yes. And besides, the Peace Corps will be yelling for me very soon. But, Uncle Fester, I need you so desperately, too. You and the world. Maybe I can squeeze you in. Uncle Fester, you are an angel. An angel! That's it. Uncle Fester, you've done it again. I can feel my creative juices surging through my veins. That's wonderful, Morticia, but I I think I better come down now. My creative juices aren't doing so well. Just this final touch. Gomez is asleep up in the tower, but I know he'll be thrilled when he sees this. Hold it, hold it just a moment. Tish, you spoke French. Will you please get me down? Darling, please, the rope. Yes, the rope. - Hurry, bubele. - Bubele. That name! Fester, dear, are you all right? I'm okay, but Look at my bugle. Hey, what do you know? It's back in tune again. This is the most important decision I have ever made. But I've made it. I've decided not to join the Peace Corps. - I'll answer the door. - Lurch'll get the door. What about my Montrose? You promised you'd get him back for me. So I did. Okay, the Peace Corps. How will I get along without your financial advice? That's true. Okay, I'm out. You mean I'm doomed to a life of spinsterhood? I'm in again. Uncle Fester, you're my sole inspiration. I'm out again. I want my Montrose. I'm in and out. Gentleman for Miss Ophelia. - Montrose! - Baby! I sure missed that. Montrose, my love. Home at last. How could I ever leave the only woman who told me how I reminded her of Richard Burton? Richard Burton? Never! You know who he reminds me of? James Bond. Thank you, Thing, that's much better. By george, Morticia, this picture you painted on the head of a pin is a dandy. Thank you, darling. I know how much you enjoy those battle scenes. Gomez, would you come outside and help me hang up this sign? Sign? What for? Well, it seems a shame to waste all that wonderful physical training I got. So I'm gonna open up my own Peace Corps physical fitness center. That's very good thinking, Uncle Fester. But doesn't the Peace Corps have a training program of their own? What do I care? I got my first student without even putting up the sign. Wonderful! Who's your new student? You rang? One more. One. 
Gomez, darling, don't move. Not a muscle. I've finally captured the real, the inner you. Paint, querida, paint. This is for posterity. Well, it's happened. Bolt of lightning knocked you out of your tree house? Oh, no! It couldn't be. He just bought a new lightning rod at the discount house. I can handle lightning, but this is worse. Uncle Fester, you haven't been drafted for military service? They're taking our finest young men. Now, don't worry, Fester, we'll find you a deferment. Cowardice. This is a letter from my pen pal, Madelyn, in Paris. - France? - IIlinois. I didn't know you had a pen pal in Illinois. Well, it wasn't my idea. But she got this letter to my pen pal Madeline, in Paris, France, by mistake, and from then on she was hooked. You do write a zingy letter. Too zingy. She's coming here to visit me. Marvelous. We'll have the guest room unbolted. But pen pals are supposed to write, not visit. Uncle Fester, is there something you're not telling us? Fess up, Fester. Have your letters led this innocent girl down the postal garden path? Well, I did kind of smear it on a little bit. Oh, well, it's normal to exaggerate in romance. Yeah, but she said she imagined me as the Cary Grant type. What's Cary Grant got that you haven't? Hair. You do have a little problem there. There's a few other things I told her, too. Like what? Like I was an All-American football player, and a boxer, and a polo player. I think she kind of likes that athletic type. You did go out on a limb a little bit, but I think I have the solution for you. What? Leave town. Nonsense, darling, he'll do no such thing. You're going to stay right here and welcome her like a true Addams. She'll be delighted when she sees you. - She won't even get the chance. - Where are you going, Uncle Fester? Well, there must be some place where a baldheaded man can hole up. Tish, would you like me if I had no hair? It might be fun polishing your scalp. Wait right here. I'll run upstairs and shave it all off. No, no, darling. We mustn't think of ourselves now. We must think of Uncle Fester. We'll take direct action. Thank you, Thing. Let's see. Gymnasiums, gypsies, hairpieces. By george, Morticia, you've done it again. With a hairpiece, Fester will knock her dead. I don't think we want to go that far, darling. Querida, we can't call anyone now. It's night, all the stores are closed. Oh. Not Max's Hair Salon. Look. "If you want a wig, dark or light, "call on Max, day or night. " Good rhythm. I'll just use his emergency night number. We'll tell him it's urgent. Yes? I must be in the wrong house. Please! Max. Oh, it's so good of you to come. Allow me, Max. Right this way. We're really in quite a bit of trouble. We'd like something nice for our Uncle Fester. Something sporty, that'll take a few years off him. Perhaps 20 or 30. Madam, I am not a magician. I can only cover his head. He'll have to cream his own wrinkles. That's fair enough. May we see a few samples? You mean without the client being present? Oh, we wouldn't dream of having Uncle Fester model before a stranger. He's much too shy. Besides, he's off somewhere brooding about his ladylove. Oh, he's got it bad. Love seems to bring out the beast in him. Oh, you mean Kitty. Kitty cat doesn't need a hairpiece. Never met a lion who did. Lion? In this house? How else are the children going to learn anything about nature? They can't wait until pet day at school. I think I'd Oh-oh. I think I'd better come back tomorrow. Nonsense, old man. As long as you're here, let's have a look at the merchandise. You rang? Lurch, a mirror, please. Mr. Max, we're ready whenever you are. All right, I'll try on a few. Morticia, you be the judge. Lurch, you hold the mirror. You're going to use that mirror? Naturally. But it's cracked! Of course. Cousin Droop dropped it for luck. Well, if that's what you want. Here is a nice model. We call it banker's gray. Distinguished but youthful. I'll try that. Thank you. - Darling, what do you think? - For you, darling, it's perfect. But I don't think Uncle Fester's the banker type. All right, do you have anything more Ivy League? Uh-uh. No, sir. - But perhaps you'd like the Mohawk. - Oh, we'll try that. Darling, what do you think? I think we're getting closer. All Fester needs is the middle part. He's got the rest of it. That's true. But I still don't think it will do, darling. It would be all right if his pen pal were Pocahontas. Don't worry, I've got more. This one needs a little combing. My comb. Oh, that's very thoughtful, Thing. Yes, thank you Hello, Kitty. That's a compliment to you, Mr. Max. Kitty doesn't come down for just everyone. Thank you and goodbye! Goodbye! What about your toupees? Keep them! "Keep them. " How generous. Darling, have you noticed how people take to Uncle Fester? Especially the ones who've never met him. Uncle Fester, now you stop squirming. Morticia, I don't wanna wear a wig. Nonsense, when you're wooing a girl, you have to make sacrifices. But I'm not wooing her, she's wooing me. All right, then you'll both have to make sacrifices. Now, turn around and let's see how that looks. That's not me. Well, it is a bit Rudolph Valentino. But don't worry, we'll find something that will do you justice. Oh, you look great in that one, Fester. Excuse me. Darling, that isn't Uncle Fester. This is Uncle Fester. Oh, by george, the spitting image of Cousin Bleak, the time the boll weevils got in his hair. Uncle Fester, go over to the large mirror. You can get a better view. - Well, what do you think? - Fat. Fine if you like the short, tall, fat, skinny type. Nonsense, Uncle Fester, you're much too self-critical. Why, with your basic good looks and charm, you could sweep Madelyn off her feet in any one of these. Get with it, old man. Exude confidence! That's easy for you to say. You don't have to wear a mop on your head. Perhaps you're right. Let's see. Let's try this one. Hey, that's more like it. Well, it does sort of give you that Madison Avenue look. Yeah, it's more my type. Come in, come in. - A visitor. - Who is it, Lurch? Pen pal. Madelyn! She mustn't see me like this. Come on, Fester, that poor girl's down there panting for you. She's not panting for me. She's panting for that tall, dark, handsome athlete I told her I was, but ain't. Uncle Fester, turn around. Come, come. Now who is that? That's General Ulysses S. Addams. - And what did he do at Vicksburg? - He surrendered. Not until they caught up with him. And that same brave blood courses through your veins. Hey, you know, you're right. - I shouldn't let a girl frighten me. - Not until you're married. Gomez and I will welcome Madelyn. You come downstairs as soon as you have your hair fixed. After all, the poor girl has come all the way from Paris, Illinois. Well, if I'm not down in five minutes, I'll be on my way to Paris, France. Welcome to the Addams house. It's so nice to see you. You can't imagine what a thrill it is to meet Fester's parents. - Parents? Are they around? - Darling, I believe she means us. We're not exactly Uncle Fester's parents, but we do try to help him keep his things in order. Especially his lightbulb and his bats. Bats? He told me he was athletic. And he has quite a head on his shoulders. Quite. You'll find him fascinating, Miss Smith. Madelyn Cavendish Beauregard Faversham Firestone Smith. - That's all one person? - Oh, no, no. Five. They were my ex-husbands. Were they pen pals, too? Only Mr. Faversham. The rest were shipboard romances. Battleship. Where is that big, strong, lovable Fester? Fester! - Oh, dear, I do believe he's gone to France. - Nonsense. Here's your dream man now. Howdy! - This is the cutest house. - We do our best to cute it up. And that's the cutest decoration. Oh, that isn't a decoration, that was Cousin Squint. It's all we could save. You're cute. Darling, I'm afraid we made a bad investment. In Consolidated Dust? In Uncle Fester's toupee. We made him much too attractive. It does seem to have brought out the Don Juan in him. In her, too. Do you realize that that woman has had five husbands? - Shows enterprise. - Enterprise? Nonsense. - She's probably just a fickle coquette. - Coquette. That's French. Speak some more, Tish. Creme de menthe, savoir faire, Brigitte Bardot, anything. - Not so loud, they'll hear you. - Ah, yes, where were we? On Madelyn's five husbands. - I checked into them. They all died. - Mysteriously? Not at all. Suicide. Darling, we have to break it up for Uncle Fester's sake. - Morticia, do we have the right? - Of course not. - But I'm still worried. - About what, querida? Uncle Fester's such a copycat. Shall we Shall we sit on the loveseat? Why not? This is This is so intime. Madelyn, when you speak French you make my blood boil. Speak some more! Hasta la vista. Skal! Gesundheit! Anything. You men have such a low boiling point. Oh, you mad, impetuous boy, let me run my fingers through your hair. - No, no. Watch it. The glue's still wet. - Glue? That's what I call my pomade. Well, got to do my workout. You rang? Lurch, my tackling dummy. When a man loses his head over a woman, it's a tragic thing to watch. Don't worry, Uncle Fester won't lose his head, just his hair. The dummy. Right over there, Lurch. - Now don't get too excited. - Be careful. Fearless Fester? - Oh, darling! Oh, darling! - I'm all right, Coach. You were magnificent. Oh, say it in French. Oh, that does it! - You know what I like about you? - What? You're different. You're the first one to ever notice. He reminds me of someone. - Cousin Itt? - That's the one. - Why don't we fly away? - Elope? I can't wait to become Mrs What is your last name, anyway? You know, you're the first one that ever asked that. Never mind, never mind. We'll leave it Smith. That way we won't have to change the monograms on the towels. Oh, goody. - Darling, I'm worried. - About what? Uncle Fester and Madelyn. I think those two are in love. - With whom? - With each other. Impossible. No, it's not at all impossible, darling. According to their horoscopes it's perfect. She's a Capricorn and he's a bachelor. By george, you're right. We may have to accept her in the family. Not only accept her. We may have to welcome her into the family. Make sure that she's anxious to marry Uncle Fester if she has any doubts. Doubts? About a catch like Fester? True. He has dazzled her. But I want her to realize that he's beautiful on the inside, too. He is. I've seen his x-ray. By george, that's one I've never made before. Dear, I do hope Madelyn doesn't wear that raccoon coat to the wedding. We'll have her wear something nice in black. Querida, you've been practicing. So you two children are going to elope. How quaint. You modern kids certainly are impetuous. Once you've found happiness, why wait? Oh, he's so cute. Well, if you're going to elope, you'll need a ring. Oh, it's beautiful. - What is it? - It's a gopher's tooth. It was Grandmother Frump's. Well, I better go upstairs to get ready. He's so cute. Yes, but there's a lot more to Fester than his good looks. Sit down, my dear. We'd like to tell you a few little things about Uncle Fester, and how to make him happy. Tell me everything. Well, for one thing, he likes to keep charged up. You mean he drinks? Oh, heavens, no. Uncle Fester is electrical. Oh, that. Electrical? He lights up. Now, for newlyweds that can be a real saving on electric bills. I guess so. And of course you know the way to a man's heart. Just speak French. Gomez, darling, I was thinking about cooking. You'll want to know some of Uncle Fester's favorite recipes. French pastry? Oh, no, no. Simple things like eye of newt. Newt? Aren't they those little crawly things? Not after you cook them. And when he's had a nice, home-cooked meal, Uncle Fester likes to relax up in his tree house. Tree house? Be sure you pick a honeymoon cottage with a tall tree. All clear below! Here comes the groom! Well, hop on. Let's hit the road. Get lost, you electrical, tree-sitting newt! - Did I do something wrong? - You got born, baldy. I told you it wouldn't work. It's just as well, Uncle Fester. A woman who doesn't know how to make a man happy certainly wouldn't make a good wife. Besides, her French was atrocious. Well, who cares? I could have never gone through life with that itchy wig. That's a lovely attitude, Uncle Fester. Someday you'll find the right kind of woman. A woman with just your kind of tastes, just your kind of interests, and just your kind of head. Now take your time, my dear. Aim carefully. That was pretty close, Morticia. Watch it. Don't worry, Fester, Annie Oakley Addams never misses. Well, almost never. I'm getting out of here. Dear Uncle Fester. He just hasn't been the same ever since that woman jilted him. Well, the whole thing is obvious to me. She just didn't like motorcycles. Dear Uncle Fester. He loves his so. Not anymore. He's taken up horseback riding. - Horseback riding? - Look. Tally-ho! So much more sensible. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family - Here you are, darling. - Thank you, my dear. GOMEZ: Pull! Excellent, my dear. Let's see if you can do this for me, though. Okay. My dear. Pull! Ole, Ole! I give up, querida mía. I simply haven't the dexterity to squeeze off shots like that. Now isn't this better than shooting apples off of Lurch's head? Much safer and less expensive. These poor steel-tipped arrows haven't a chance against Lurch's head. Incidentally, darling, does Lurch seem troubled to you? I spoke to him a few moments ago and he didn't even answer me. Didn't act like he heard me. - Do you suppose he's ill? - I don't know. He's been terribly depressed ever since he got that letter from his mother this morning. Not himself at all. - How could you tell? - He smiled. Something has given him a bad turn. We should find him and get to the root of it. More. More. Oh, gosh, Lurch, give me a turn. You've been having all the fun. Lurch, you're relaxing. That's a relief. We were worried about you. He says the rack is the only thing that helps him forget his troubles. Well, it'll do it every time, but you do have a problem, eh, old man? Now, it's not that bad. Come on, we'll get you off the rack and we'll talk about it. Mama, Uncle Fester's fixing a tasty new dish. Why don't you run along, maybe he'll share it with you. I could stand a snack. Selfish! Come on, old man. Speak up. Now, Lurch, does it have anything to do with the letter you received from your mother this morning? Why, I should think you'd be pleased that she's going to visit. We'd love to have her stay with us. We could put her up in that nice attic room. - No. - No? I fibbed. To your mama? Well, Mr. Addams and I understand. We understand about those little white lies that a roaming son writes his mother. Lurch, that picture of the house that you sent to your mother, you told her it was your house, right? Well, we always think of you as one of the family, Lurch. - A servant. - A very good servant. - I'm a liar. - And a very good liar. - Gomez! - Oh, sorry, I got carried away. Now don't you fret about a thing. We'll put our heads together and see what we can do to help you. We'll call a family conference. Maybe Uncle Fester can think of something. He has a good head on his shoulders. Too bad Cousin Slimy isn't around. He has two of them. I say let's mine the front porch. I can wire it so it'll blow up when she pushes the doorbell. That always discourages those magazine salesmen. Not bad, Fester, but why not just wire the doorbell with a few thousand volts? No need to damage the porch. No, no, darling, that wouldn't be kind. You let her get all the way to the door and then disappoint her like that. - Why not have Lurch play dead? - Good thinking. You think Lurch could be convincing? He looks so alive. It was a very sweet thought, darling, but that's true. Lurch is so vivacious. His most outstanding characteristic. I have it. If Mrs. Lurch thinks that Lurch is a very important, big man and owns this house and everything, why don't we just let her continue to think so? Querida mía. Leave it to you, with your feminine intuition, - to come up with the correct answer. - Darling. Tish, when you pat my cheek it drives me wild. You Castilians are so fiery. Yes, Cousin Manuelo was a pyromaniac. Darling, later, later. Let's concentrate on Lurch. Oh, yes. - Now - Forgive me. for the few days that Mrs. Lurch is here, we'll let her think that Lurch is the head of the household, - and we'll be the servants. - Marvelous. Do you think I'd make a convincing butler? Darling, I couldn't imagine a subtler butler. You'll completely captivate Mrs. Lurch with your savoir-faire. Tish, when you speak French, you know how it affects me. Later, mon cher, later, not now. We have to get this thing settled. Now, I'll be the maid and Mama will be the cook. - I will not! - Mama. My schoolgirl complexion may have graduated, but I'm not gonna get dish-pan hands for anyone. I'll stay in the cottage till that woman leaves. Excellent idea, Mama, and you can take the children with you. Oh, that's a very good idea, dear. Now, Uncle Fester, - you can be the gardener. - Forget it. But, Uncle Fester, wouldn't you like to potter around in the back yard, maybe plant some crabgrass or stickweed? I like the back yard just the way it is. Bare. I'm gonna move out in the cottage with the others. Well, I guess it'll just have to be the two of us. Darling, we can do it. Let's go tell Lurch and rehearse our roles. There you are, madam. Are you ready for your soup now, sir? Cara bella! Oh, Morticia, you're enchanting. Thank you, kind sir. Darling, you make a superb butler. It gives full play to your courtly Castilian manner. Oh, Tish, you ravishing creature. Darling, now, remember our new positions. Oh, yes, yes, yes. - Is Lurch ready for his first lesson? - Yes, he's in the living room now. Now, remember, darling, one ring is for you, two rings for me. Yeah. That's me. - You rang? - You rang? No, no, Lurch. You rang. Oh, no, sir. You rang for me because I'm your butler. And I'm not "sir," I'm Gomez. - Now sit down. - Yes, sir. Gomez. Perhaps this will help. A cigar gives a man that masterful feeling. Have you ever smoked? You got a couple of bad leaks there, old man. - You better forget the cigars. - It's no use. You can do it, Lurch. Just concentrate. Think big. Think important. Think that you are master of all you survey. Think. That's it. Splendid, Lurch. You got it. Now ring for the maid and demand your breakfast. You rang? - Telephone, Gomez. - Yes, sir. I'll get it, sir. Please, Lurch. I answer the phone. Your evening paper, sir. No, no, Lurch, not the funnies. The financial page. Wealthy men always turn to the financial page first. I like the funnies. Very good, Lurch. You actually sounded masterful then. Now, as far as pinching the maid Perhaps that would be carrying it a bit too far. But I don't want your mother to become suspicious. Perhaps you'd better just make eyes at me instead. Try it, Lurch. Lurch, as mistress of this house, I'm ordering you to make eyes at me. Perhaps you'd better just try a devilish smile. Forget it, Lurch. I'm just not your type. - Your Cognac, sir. - I never drink. Nonsense. Gentlemen of quality always have a brandy after dinner. It's a sign of sophistication and culture. Well, he just flunked sophistication. - Morticia. - Darling, what do you think? Cousin Imar asked me to sew in his college seal. Princeton. Beautiful. Morticia, we've done it. Lurch just ordered me to shine his shoes. That's wonderful. He even reprimanded me this morning. He said his toast wasn't black enough. He's completely brainwashed. The doorbell. That may be his mama now. - It's Mama. - All right. Now you let me open the door properly, Lurch. You greet her right here. - How do you do? - Where's my boy? - There you are! Sonny. - Mama. There she goes again. That's me. Two rings. That's me. Three blasts. It's an all-out command performance this time. Let's wait till she makes up her mind. Sonny, I don't know how you put up with such miserable servants. They're never around when you want them. She really is a little cyclone. Not at all what I expected Lurch's mother to be like. I haven't sat down since she got here. What is it, darling? I'm all kinked up from last night, sleeping on the divan. I miss our nice, big bed. Well, I suppose she was right in saying that Lurch should have the master bedroom. After all, she does think he's the master of the house. Well, at least you slept on Lurch's bed in the attic. She's really quite insensitive for such a dear little thing. Do you know she hates Pugsley's octopus? Anyone who'd hate an octopus is warped. She even tried to feed it to Cleopatra. That's inhuman. I rescued them just in time. Let's call off this whole mad charade. Oh, darling, please be patient. It's only for a few more days. You'd better go to her now before she rings the house down. Oh, Tish, when you help me with my coat it goes right through me. - It's impossible. - What's impossible? That blondes have more fun. You rang? I don't trust you, Gomez, you've got shifty eyes and no good butler wears a moustache. Sorry, madam, I was born with it. Where have you been off to? Some dark corner with that hussy of a maid? Sir, I appeal to you. You don't appeal to him and you don't appeal to me. My son is just too sweet and gentle. People take advantage of him. You're sloppy and inefficient. Sir, please tell her. You're sloppy and inefficient. Yes, sir. I'll try to do better, sir. - What kind of monstrosity is that? - That's Thing, madam. Well, set a trap for it. Get it back in that box, nail the lid down. Yes, madam. Well, snap to it. You're living on borrowed time around here. Mama's going to stay until she gets things straightened out around this place. Big, important men like her sonny are much too busy to be bothered running a household. Yes, Mama. Thing, I'm sorry I had to nail up your favorite box, but you don't realize the spot we're in. Try to stay Try to stay undercover for the next couple of days, please. Gomez, darling, I'm afraid we've made a terrible mistake. Instead of pleasing Lurch's mother all we're doing is making her miserable. Perhaps, but Lurch certainly is happy. Do you know he's really beginning to believe that he owns this house? And that we're his servants? Just hold out for a couple of more days and everything will be back to normal. - Darling, you're so noble and generous. - That's true. But, you're every bit as magnanimous, querida mía. A-ha! - Caught in the act! - Madam, allow us to explain. No need. I can see the plot now. You intend to wheedle Sonny into marriage. Then you'll do away with him and marry this shameless witch. - Then you'll both split his fortune. - Nonsense. - Gomez wouldn't harm a fly. - I've read a lot of detective stories and the butler is always the one who does it. Well, you can forget it all now. I'm wise to both of you. You know, the way things are going, her idea isn't bad. Those people got to go. I won't leave this house till I see you safely set up with decent help. - Maybe a raise. - A raise? - They want all your money. - They seemed so nice. Yeah, well, you just call them in and give them their walking papers. Just call them in and tell them they're fired. - Now! Quick! Git! - Yes, Mama. - You rang, sir? - You're fired. You mean you're dismissing us? You're fired. Now pack your things and git! Isn't it customary to give two-weeks notice? Not to cutthroats and thieves. On your way! Scoot! Lurch, do something. - No, no, I mean, say something. - Good luck. - We'll pack our bags at once. - And leave the silverware. Good riddance. And now I'll phone the Employment Agency, and get two good replacements right away. Yes, Mama. Why doesn't that woman go home? I don't like living out here. It's too crowded. Maybe Morticia's man-eating plant will get her. You're a dreamer. I'll get it. Well, here we are. One big happy family again. - Did she leave? - We did. We've been fired. We'll just have to move in here with you until she goes home. But that's ridiculous. How can you get fired from your own home? That's an interesting question. We can't all live in here. It's too crowded now, and that old spitfire will probably stay on for ages. I won't give up my bed. I just got the nails nicely broken in. We really ought to buy another house. Just for emergencies like this. I said this whole idea was crazy. You're both as soft as jellyfish. Coddling a butler. Oh, Uncle Fester, you should see how happy Lurch is. Well, he should see how miserable we are. I'm going right up to the house and straighten this whole mess out. And I'll go with you. - It takes a woman to handle a woman. - Oh, please, Mama. Please don't do anything to spoil it now that it's almost over. Oh, don't worry. She doesn't know us. We'll tell her we're the next-door neighbors. Yeah, we'll tell them what wonderful servants you are, that we've had our eye on you for years. Yeah, that's a great idea. And that we want you so much that she'll wanna hire you right back. Gomez, do you really think she'll take us back? If she does I'm gonna ask for a raise. - Well, you're very prompt. - Well, now look, Mrs. Lurch Well, please, come right in. You can start at once. - You don't seem to understand. - Of course I understand. You're the new butler and you're the new maid, and I must say you're just perfect. - Oh, well, that's very kind of you - A real butler. Such polish, such poise, such a continental manner. I trust you completely. Oh, well, that's very generous, you see, but - What's the salary? - Anything you ask. Price is no object when you demand quality. - I'll take it. - Just a minute. Now, look, you do what you wanna do, but I'm back in a decent house and I'm getting paid for it. I do hope you'll stay, too. You're exactly the kind of maid my son needs. A mature, sensible woman who won't be making eyes at him like the last one did. Well, maybe I'll try it. I haven't had a regular income for a long time. Wonderful! Now I can go back home. I know my son is in good hands. Well, goodbye, Sonny. Goodbye, Mama. Dear Lurch, you were just marvelous. I'm sure your mother is very proud of you. Nice work, old man, you brought it off splendidly. Where are you two going? It's all over now. We're going back into the house. I'm sorry. Your positions have been filled. Lurch, please stop playing. But I love music. Lurch, we're waiting for you to serve dinner. Me? Serve dinner? Oh, Lurch, I thought we had you completely unbrainwashed. Let's try it again. - You rang? - You rang? Now I'm doing it again. That was very good, Lurch. Almost like your old self. Thank you, Mrs. Addams. Now would you please serve dinner? Oh, the poor dear. This has been a very harrowing experience for him but I do think he's his old self again. Shall we go into dinner, cara bella? Yes, darling. Lurch. You're fired. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family That Zen-Yogi is so interesting. Not only good for your feet but your head, too. That's right. It's really very cultural, isn't it? Mama can have her painting. -Painting? -She's gotten so, so arty. She can't wait till you see it, Gomez. Very well. Coming up. Alley-oop! Oop! By George, Mama! This new technique of yours is a dandy. It does give me a feeling of release. -That's it. You've done it. -Not quite. It still needs a little something. Mama, I beg you, don't tamper with perfection. Oh, trust Mama. GOMEZ: Superb. It should be on exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum. You're too kind. But what I need is the eye of a critic. -A critic? -Yes. Someone who'd give an unbiased opinion of my work. If you don't believe me you can ask Uncle Fester. Well, he's sweet, but he has an axe to grind. That's just for recreation. What I need is an outsider. Very well, Mama. I'll call in my friend, Bosley Swain. Well, Bosley, what do you say? Unbelievable. I told you I knew great art. Mr. Swain, am I expressing the real me? Oh, it's the real you. Couldn't be anybody else. How sweet of you to say so. What would you suggest as my next step? A teacher. Is there a teacher you could recommend for Mama? No. Really very nice of Bosley Swain, being so encouraging about Mama. Mama's painting is most unusual. Well, one thing is certain. She has her own technique. She throws that paint with a curve. If you do find a teacher for her, make sure he's got a good arm. Do you think the Zen-Yogi society will hang this picture of you in their office? It'll fit in so perfectly with the rest of their decor. You know, you and Mr. Swain are so flattering, but I wish he could have recommended a teacher for me. I've got it. The perfect teacher for you. Picasso! Picasso? For me? You rang? Lurch, do you have any idea where Picasso might be? Tahiti? No, Lurch, that was the other painter fellow. The one who hobnobbed with the native girls. See what you can do on the phone, Lurch. Try France. Yes, Mr. Addams. I wonder what Picasso's doing now. The last I heard, he was fiddling around with ceramics. -Paris. -Thank you, Lurch. Bonjour, mademoiselle. Comment ca va? Could you connect me with Mr. Picasso, the painter? Lurch told me you had Paris on the line. Could you switch me over to the Folies-Bergere? I'd like to talk to my French pen pal. -I thought Yvonne lived in a convent. -No, she moved. You don't talk to pen pals. You write to them. Darn. Oh. Well, thank you, operator. That's odd, she never even heard of Picasso. Mamacita! We forgot our ancestral land! Spain. It's 3:00 in the morning there. Do you suppose he'll be up? Certainly. Everyone in Spain is up half the night dancing and funning. Let me try it. -Would you like to? -I'd love to. Hello? Yes, operator, yes, yes. This is Picasso. Sam Picasso. All right. Hello? GRANDMAMA: Mr. Picasso, the artist? Could be. Who wants to know? The name is Addams, from America. From America? America? Oh, that's -ls this call collect? -Oh, no! I hope I haven 't caught you at a bad time. No. No, dear lady, no. As a matter of fact, I wasn't doing anything important tonight. Good. Then how about coming to America and living with us? Could be. But of my service, what did you have in mind? Babysitter? Gigolo? Gardener? Well, because I'm very good in all three of them. I want you to teach me to paint. Paint? Oh, paint! That's what I do better than best. -Well, how soon can you leave? -How soon can you send me the fare? -lmmediately. -I'm leaving. Yankee Doodle went to town cha, cha, cha La, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la Hello. Hello. Who are you? I'm Wednesday. It's too bad what happened to your doll, eh? She isn't a doll. She's Mary, Queen of Scots. Grandmama was telling us what happened to her, and my brother Pugsley chopped off her head. PlCASSO: "Marie Antoinette. " "Little Red Riding Hood. " Little Red Riding Hood? -She didn't die. -The way we play it she does. -ls your family home? -They're always at home. -I would like to see them. -You would? Yes. All right. Come on. Come on. Mother! Father, Mr -Picasso. -Picasso is here! Addams here. Welcome to America. -This is America? -Well, it's not all like this. Not everyone has it this good. Wednesday, run to Mr. Picasso's room and make sure the shades are drawn. Yes, Father. Here comes your pupil now, sir. Oh, maestro. I think I'm going to faint. Not before I do. Gomez, darling, what's all the excitement? My lovely wife, Morticia. The great Picasso. I'm so glad you could come. You know, it's strange. I was under the impression that you were short and round and bald. Darling, he's short and round. You can't have everything. If there's anything you'd like, just name it. -What's for dinner? -I'll go see. Cocktails. Thank you, Lurch. That's very thoughtful of you. A vintage brew from the Addams wine cellars, Mr. Picasso. Especially for you. To Mr. Picasso. Long may he live. At least a couple more days. I thought you might like another little snack. -What's in it? -Pate of yak. -Sounds delicious. -lt is. Try one. -ls different. -Yes. Yes, it is. By George, Mama, that is a dazzler! I never could have done it without Mr. Picasso. What shall I do next, Mr. Picasso? I would suggest, senora, that you practice your brushstrokes up and down, up and down. See how it's Very bad. No, no, no. Your wrist is too stiff. Flexibility, flexibility. Oh, yes. To get a better view you've got to move back. As far back as upstairs. You come for dinner, eh? Very good, very good. Keep up, keep up. -lsn't he inspiring? -He certainly is. Not only that, he's the only guest we've ever had who appreciates pate of yak. I hope that's not the ladies from the charity bazaar. My paintings aren't nearly ready. It's probably Bosley Swain. I invited him over to see the improvement in your work. -Mr. Swain. -Swain, good to see you. I am terribly busy, but you said that your mother had a new teacher and that I was in for a big surprise. There it is, old man. Feast your eyes. Who is the culprit? I mean, teacher? -Mr. Picasso. -Picasso? Yes. Came clear over from Spain. Brought some of his own masterpieces. There it is. -A genuine Picasso. -Yes, a genuine Sam Picasso. Worth about 40 cents. This man is a bum. Been trading on the Picasso name for 20 years. Nonsense. If this isn't Pablo Picasso, then we've discovered a great new talent. Oh, come now. I'll admit he showed promise as a young man, but he hasn't painted anything but wallpaper in years now. Someday that wallpaper will be worth a fortune. You take my advice. If you want a teacher, you throw this freeloader out and take a correspondence course. How unprofessional jealousy can twist a man's mind. I never thought old Bosley would sink that low. With his influence he could turn the whole art world against poor Sam. Ruin his reputation. -We have got to help him. -How? We're gonna make him work, work, work till he reveals himself to the world as the true genius that he is. Mr. Picasso. Mr. Picasso. -Dinner is served? -Work. Oh, senor. Gosh, you going to ruin my appetite. No, no, no. As a starter we'll find something simple. Let's see. What'll it be? Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! You want me to work? You're a genius, Picasso. I won't permit you to waste your talent. From now on you're going to paint, paint, paint. But this is ridiculous. I cannot be turned on like a kitchen faucet. You must, old boy. You owe it to posterity. Please, I owe enough already. Senor Gomez, believe me, I cannot paint a stroke without brushes made from goats' hair from Tibet. Perfect. I'll write my friend, the high lama. He'll send us all the goats we need. And what about the canvas? You do not know, of course not, that I use canvasses made from Egyptian cotton. I'll have the family helicopter pick some up on the way back from Tibet. It's still no good. I cannot paint in a living room. -No. -No! -No. -No! -We fixed up a special studio just for you. -Thank you. Come on. Voila!You can work here without any distraction. Won't you believe me? I love distractions. Mr. Picasso, we'll have all your meals sent in. -Senor, but where will I sleep? -Sleep, you say? This one. This is an instrument of torture. Nonsense, Mr. Picasso. Great art is born of great suffering. This should bring something precious out of you. Blood. -That's the spirit, old boy. Carry on. -But If you want anything, just shriek. Let me out of here. Please. Please help. Help! Now, now, Mr. Picasso, mustn't be lazy. Back to your easel and just paint, paint, paint. -How's Michelangelo doing? -He's getting comfortable. We're gonna make a great artist out of him if it kills him. FESTER: Hey, that's a good idea. You know, no artist is famous until his death. Maybe we could arrange it. MORTlClA: No, I don't think we should, Uncle Fester. We want Mr. Picasso to suffer for his art, but dying is going a little too far. Mr. Picasso, relaxing from your labors? Isn't that sweet? He and Cleopatra have found each other. Don't get too close, old man, she's an ear nibbler. Now, now, Cleopatra, this is no time for romance. Mr. Picasso has work to do. She nearly crushed me. Quite a feather in your cap. She's not usually so affectionate with strangers. Now, Mr. Picasso, back to your studio. Studio. Come, old man. You know you're just dying to get back to work. Senor, please, don't use that word again. Thank you. Querida. Here I am, Mr. Picasso. Are you ready? Por favor, Senor. Give me time to write a letter to my poor little old mother. You can do that later. You'd better get me now while I'm in the mood to model. You came here to model? Well, sure. I've modeled all of Gomez's Halloween pumpkins. He's quite a talented pumpkin carver. Well, I'm sorry, sir. You see, I only paint apples. Darn. No use, Lurch. He's only painting apples. Lunch. Nice big boy, maybe we can make a deal? -Deal? -To get me out of here. -Where did you come from? -Pugsley's tunnel. He has them all over the place. Of course. What is a home without a secret tunnel? I came to watch you paint. -You like to paint, eh, Wednesday? -Sure, painting's fun. -Watch. -Yes. -Yeah? -You like, Mr. Picasso? Oh, that's gorgeous, yes. By next year you will be a good Grandma Moses. Hey, wait a minute. You said something about a tunnel, no? Pugsley's a great tunneler. Some people think he's part gopher. Could be, could be. Why not? Tell me. -Where does your secret tunnel lead to? -Just outside. Just outside? Oh, you're right! I'm going to take a stroll just outside. Can I paint while you're gone? To your heart's content. -Kitty won't hurt you. -No? She once ate a zookeeper and got a upset stomach. So -She's very careful now. -How did you know? A little birdie, a little birdie. A little vulture told me so. Well, you wish me luck, eh? And you paint. You paint any time you want. There. It's finished. That's a beautiful vase, Uncle Fester. That's not a vase, Gomez. That's an urn for Grandfather Malaprop. How thoughtful. He is getting on. What have we here? -Why, it's Mr. Picasso. -Where did you find him, Lurch? Sneaking through the henbane. Now, Mr. Picasso, we can't get our work done playing in the henbane, can we? You know what we're going to have to do now. Back to the pit. GOMEZ: Penniless, her little fingers bleeding from the tuna cans, she may return and say she's sorry. Why, Mr. Picasso! You have been busy. What sophistication, throwing these masterpieces around as though they were confetti. Superb. I knew if we worked hard we'd get it out of you. I have seen better things gotten out of a man with a scalpel. True genius. Never satisfied. Look, now that you got this out of me, can I get out of here? Nonsense, Mr. Picasso. Not until we have our expert, Bosley Swain, look at your work. Senora, can I leave before you show to Mr. Bosley Swain? Certainly not. It's so rare for an artist to be present at his own personal triumph. Old man, this will be your finest hour. Or my last. Well, Bosley, what do you say now? Incredible. I didn't think you were capable of anything like this. You hit me and I will report you to the Spanish consul. Hit you. I want to congratulate you. -You mean to say you like them? -They're masterpieces! What childlike simplicity. And what unique subject matter. Trees with human heads. I told you he was great, Bosley. All he needed was the Addams influence to bring it out. Just think, someday they may put a plaque in the front of our house saying, "Sam Picasso slept here. " Who slept? Sam, I am buying all of them. And I'll send my man to pick them up. This is just the beginning, Picasso. You can stay here and work as long as you like. Oh, no. I think I'll go back to Spain. -Paint, paint, paint? -No, fight bull fights. Is much safer. Adios, I think. Adios, Picasso. I tell you, querida, talent is contagious around here. Why, you're another Mama. Darling, thank you. Tish, when you bow that way you drive me wild. You mad Castilian. -Mail's in. -We've got all we need. I think I'd better get it, dear. Thank you, Thing. I think it's from Mr. Picasso in Spain. -Did he really go into fighting bulls? -Oh, yes. -Now he's back to painting them. -Wonderful. You know, darling, he was really a very good influence. Not only on Grandmama and on me, but on Wednesday. You know, she's started to paint exactly like him. Superb. Will you look at that? Nothing like environment. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family I think I've had enough moon. Thank you. Gomez, darling, do be careful. You know how prone you are to moonburn. Never fear, querida. My skin is so white it won't peel anymore. My head is a little tingly. Uncle Fester, how about you? Would you like another little dab of lanolin? No, thanks. I like it, but it gives me heartburn. Uncle Fester, the last time we moonbathed, you ate the goose grease. This time, the lanolin. What did you expect me to do with it, smear it all over my face? Very interesting. Very interesting. Is Jupiter transiting Uranus, dear? No, our next-door neighbor is just stepping into his shower. Oh, well, it is a warm night. - And how are you, Mama? - Fine, fine. - She likes being buried. - And playing groundhog. Mama, you sure you're getting enough air? I took a deep breath before they buried me. Oh, yes. The family that plays together stays together. The telephone. Don't worry, my dear, I left strict orders not to be disturbed. How very thoughtful. - I don't care who's calling, do you? - Certainly not. - Unless you do. - I don't. - Well, I do. Let's find out. - Yes, let's. You rang? Yes, Lurch, we were somewhat curious about - Lurch, who was that on the phone? - Man from Strife magazine. Strife magazine? I should think one subscription for each member of the family would be enough. - He was a photographer. - A photographer? He said he'd come back next week. I wonder what he wanted. Oh, this is just a shot in the dark, dear, but since he was a photographer, I suppose he wanted to take a photo. Sound thinking, my dear, but of whom? Or is it who? This is the time they choose their Man of the Year. - Exactly. - Tish, you don't suppose And why not? Who deserves the honor more than you? Well, that's true, but Well, there are others, of course. Who knows more about Zen-Yogi, breeding barracudas and wrecking railroad trains? No one. But But still And who can match your dexterity with the boomerang, your skill at Parcheesi, your savoir faire? Tish. Those French words. They win me. Darling, grab your telescope. Imagine. My darling sweet Gomez on the cover of Strife magazine. I can just see it now. Those cover pictures are dreadful, especially the ones on Strife magazine. No problem, we'll simply go through the family album and select one of our own. And I know just the one. It captures all your inner fire, your sterling intensity and the real you. This one? Oh, no, darling. That's lovely, but that's not the one I meant. You were such a distinguished little baby with such a distinguished little moustache. Yes, saved Mama the trouble of straining the baby food. We've gone through the entire album. This is the only one left. Gomez, darling, that's it! See how it captures your inner dynamics, your sense of destiny, your divine fire. By george, you are right! It is the real me. Oh, close your eyes. Can't you just imagine it on the cover of Strife magazine? Picture like that. They may want to save it for the Man of the Century. Oh, it's wonderful, Gomez. Simply Oh, darling Cleopatra, cough up that photograph. Come on, cough it up. Darling, please control yourself. After all, aggression only breeds aggression. Now, wait. Cleopatra, dear, let Mother have it, sweetheart. Come on, darling. Perhaps, we should use a little aggression. - Oh, it's too late. - There goes the real me. Darling, why don't we have Croom Strauss, that same photographic genius who took that picture, take another one of you. - Capital idea! - I'll have Lurch lay out your best suit. - Querida, this is my best suit. - Oh? Don't you remember? I bought dozens of them. - I wanted nothing but best suits. - Of course, dear. Well, off to Croom Strauss. I know exactly where that exclusive little studio of his is located. Croom Strauss. Come. I'm afraid he's gone out of business, the only photographer, the only artist, the only virtuoso of the prismatic lens who could capture the real Gomez Addams, gone. Cheer up, darling. I'm sure there are dozens of photographers who can take your picture. Take my picture, yes, but capture the real me? Never! Well, perhaps, not dozens, but at least several? A couple? One? No. Well, you're right, dear. This is the bitterest blow since the city made us fill in our lovely patch of quicksand. Good morning, Uncle Fester. Up at your exercises early, I see. You're just in time for a nice hot cup of henbane. Oh, no, thank you, Morticia, I'm on a diet. I just had some soap crunchies. Real bubbly. Fester, you're going to have to watch those in-between-meal snacks. You'll be on those stilts all day. - Gomez darling, cup of henbane? - No, nothing. When are you coming down? You've been up there three days. You know how he is when he's depressed. Well, being made Man of the Year is depressing. It's because we can't find the one photographer in the whole world who can capture the real Gomez Addams. Is that all? Your troubles are over. They are? Like Michelangelo with a camera. You know where he is? - Sure. - Where? - Standing right in front of you. - Back to the chandelier. Oh, no, Gomez. I know my way around the camera. That's true, darling. Remember his studies of salamanders spawning in a mud bath? By george, Fester, you're the solution to my problems. Let's get started. - Oh, wait, dear. Freshen up first. - Freshen up? Is that necessary? Necessary. - You ready, Fester? - Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready. Perfect! You never looked better, Gomez. Fester, you're sure the camera's pointed in the right direction? Well, maybe it is a little off-center. Oh, now I really have it. It's going to be the best picture you ever took. Uncle Fester, you're focusing on the warthog. Oh, yeah. Probably the best picture the warthog ever took. Fester, don't you think you'd better start with Cousin Itt? Oh, sure. I want this to look real pretty. Better take off his hat and glasses. Capital idea. Darling, I think a profile shot would be much more interesting, don't you? Good thinking, my dear. There. - How's that? - Much better. Why, I think that's a lovely idea, Cousin Itt. - Why don't you wear your new suit? - Yes, and have Thing give you a little trim. Okay, Gomez. Let's get cracking. We're going to make photographic history. Now, darling, let me see that lovely Addams charm. Tish. That French. - All right. Hold it. - Just a moment. Darling, later. Later. Later. That's funny. Now it doesn't look so good. - How about this? - Much better. Okay. One, two A little lower, please. A little lower, please. Lower. Lower. Lower. Hold it! Uncle Fester, did you get it? Yeah, right in the head. Darling. I've hired a private detective to find your favorite photographer. Just haven't heard from him yet. Well, maybe you ought to hire a private detective to find the private detective you hired. I'll never come down. You know, it must be nicer up there than I thought it was. Darling, Gomez Hello. Oh, yes. Yes, just one moment, please. Darling, it's the detective I hired. Yes. How wonderful! Gomez, he found our photographer. Eureka! Morticia Quiet, please. Now, pardon me. Once more. Where can we find him? Oh, dear, that's dreadful. Thank you so much. Querida, don't keep me in suspense. What time is the appointment with Croom Strauss? - Darling, we have a slight complication. - There's someone ahead of me. Thousands! He now works for the Department of Motor Vehicles. He takes the pictures they use on the drivers' licenses. What a proud thing it is to live in a state with such high aesthetic requirements. Don't you see? The only way you can possibly be photographed by him is to get a driver's license. Bully! I've always wanted one. Darling, you've never been able to drive. True. But there's very little I don't know about the modern horseless carriage. - Except how to shift gears. - And steer. Yeah, and put on the brakes. Well, those things do give me a little trouble. A little trouble? Remember the blue falcon bird we had? Oh, yeah. Big Blue. Nothing could stop that car, scorching desert, snow-covered mountains, she could go anywhere. Except between two street cars. Still as solid as the day she rolled out of the showroom. Yeah. - And so is our old Stanley Steamer. - Makes a beautiful mobile, doesn't it? By Jove, after all these years, she can still build up a fine head of steam. Querida, just a little practice and I'll be right back in there again. Marvelous idea, darling. I shall be your instructress. - Gomez, you're riding the clutch again. - Really, certainly rides beautifully. Now, darling, listen. You're going through a school zone. School zone. Your speedometer is registering - Seventy-five per. - What are you doing wrong? Blocking traffic? Think, darling. Think. 'Course, I'm not waving to the little nippers as I drive by. Hiya, kids, how are you? - Gomez, dear. Put on your brake. - Brake. That's not the brake, Gomez! - Are you sure? - Pretty sure. This is the brake. Oh, well, by this time, I'm out of the school zone, so I shift into high, and away we go. Gomez, darling, you just shifted into reverse. Well, these new cars are not what they used to be. Neither am I. I'm pooped. Well, I guess we're all agreed that the test run was a huge success. You rang? I did indeed, Lurch. Bring the car around to the door and let us away to the Department of Motor Vehicles. I'm off to take my driver's test. I couldn't have said it better myself, Lurch. Tallyho, one and all! Hey, what kind of an outfit is that? Just the very latest in modern motoring. One should always dress for the occasion, shouldn't one? Yes, darling. That's why I'd like for you to wear this. Egad, what a smart little beanie! - You like it, dear? - Love it. Though there seems to be an overabundance of smog today. Well, in that case, I think we'd better dispense with it. Anything you say, querida. Darling, are you sure you can handle this? My dear, I've made an exhaustive study of the internal combustion engine. Lurch, how do you start it? It sounds like Cousin Itt. Cousin Itt! What are you doing under there? You washed your hair? And you were sitting under the hood, letting it dry. Very clever. Oh, I love your new hairdo. It's so So you! I'm sorry we disturbed you. Gomez, you're riding the clutch again. - Smooth, isn't it? - Only for standing still, dear. Well, if it's action you want - Triumph of man over machine. - Really, darling, whose machine? A whole slough of them, blocking my path. Lurch, this can go on the mobile. He's taking his written test. Good, then he'll never get to the driver's test. Perfect score! And in 10 seconds flat. A new indoor record. - Oh, that's wonderful, darling. - Let's go. Oh, this is the dedicated public servant who's going to conduct the driving test. My dedicated wife, my dedicated uncle, my dedicated cousin and Now, let's get it over with. Please, wait. I want to be with him when he takes his driving test. Lady, I wish I didn't have to be with him. No wives, relatives, or dogs. He's a bit touchy about that. I do think he's getting used to it. Come, dear. Let's get moving. But, Cousin Itt, what safer place is there to stand than right here? Another town? He's the family wit. - We're off. - Darling These old thoroughbreds are very temperamental. Mr. Addams, you do know how to drive? Sir, I'm going to treat you to the drive of your life. Thank you, Thing. Well, sir, what's the word? - You ought to be arrested. - Arrested? For even thinking of driving. I never drive. Lurch, our chauffeur, does all the driving. Then why? Why do you want a driver's license? For the picture, of course. The picture? Of course? Sure. The picture you put on the drivers' licenses. - You want that? - Precisely. You have a new employee, Wolfgang Croom Strauss, the world's greatest photographer. That creep? He was fired the same day he was hired. And between you and me, I don't know how he lasted that long. Great art is never appreciated in its own time. Well, we're right back where we started. Destiny seems determined to brush me aside. Brush. Gomez, darling, that's it! Tish, you're marvelous. Only you as an artist could capture both the inner and outer Gomez, simultaneously. French. Darling Gomez, please. The painting, dear. Querida, you've done it! The perfect picture for Strife magazine's Man of the Year. Hey, it's my turn. I wonder who that could be at the door. - What was that? - Must be termites. King size. Man from Strife. Come in. Come in, old man. Strife magazine has been one of our favorites. - We simply devour it from cover to cover. - Quite delicious. - I guess we know why you're here. - You mean about the picture? Yes, it's all ready for you. Took a bit of doing, but here it is. Thing? Your Man of the Year. There's been some mistake. You see, we already have our Man of the Year. But the picture. I thought you wanted a picture. Yeah, of your house. Our house. You mean, we've made House of the Year? Well, sort of. You see we are running a story on haunted houses, and yours has been chosen the spookiest one of all. Thank you. We do try. This is even better than Man of the Year. This is a salute to the whole family. 
All right, sailor, pass the powder and grape shot and we'll rake her fore and aft! No. Hey, you mutinous dog. I'll have you quartered. Flogged and keelhauled. - On the double! - No. Come on, Fester, be a good sport. I'm tired of being Benedict Arnold and Jesse James and John Wilkes Booth. I'm tired of being a good sport. All right. If you want to be childish. Ahoy, my beloved. Time for another great moment in Addams history. Will it take long, darling? I want to have these traps ready by tonight. Only a moment, chérie. But what a moment! It was seven bells on that fateful night in the North Atlantic. A fierce sou'wester was howling through the rigging, as Admiral John Paul Addams drove his stout little frigate straight into the heart of the German flotilla. Foaming up at his stern at flank speed was Admiral Tojo and the imperial fleet. Oh, Gomez, I never tire of this one. It was then Admiral Addams fired that shot heard round the world after uttering those inspired words, "If you need me, I'll be in my cabin. " Man the pumps, scuttle the bilge, abandon ship. And get a wrench. You've wrecked the plumbing again. I do it every time. You can take your finger out of the pipe, Fester. I shut it off at the main. It could've happened to anybody. Not to an Addams. That's four times in a row. From now on the children mix the gunpowder. Pretty soon I'll be nobody around here. I'm going up to my closet. What's bothering him? Perhaps I was too sharp with him. Oh, darling, he'll get over it. Uncle Fester just isn't too practical. I may as well go upstairs and call the plumber. Darling, who's being impractical now? Why don't I call that nice Mr. Beesley, our insurance man, and let him take care of everything? I don't think we better bother him again. Bother him? Darling, you know how excited he gets every time we call. I'm sure he'd be terribly hurt if we didn't get in touch with him. Come along. One more telephone call from Addams and I am going to kill you, Beesley. Three big claims paid on this policy in one year. So just one more policy like that and Excelso-Fidelity Insurance will pull our franchise. Arthur J. Henson, President, speaking. Hello, Mr. President. This is Mrs. Addams. A very unusual thing just happened in our playroom. Admiral Addams Well, actually it was Uncle Fester. You see, they hanged Admiral Addams Well, he accidentally got just a pinch too much sulfur in the gunpowder, so that when he fired the cannon, it hit a water pipe. A broken water pipe? My I will not pay another I've only He's charming, but he seems rather confused. - Lf you'll permit me, my dear. - Yes, darling. - Do you understand? Not one more claim. - Thank you. This is Gomez Addams. What seems to be your problem? Now get this through your thick head, Addams. We're not paying you one more cent and that is final! Come, come, Henson. You don't really expect me to jump at your first offer? Oh, you want a better offer? Well, go jump in the lake. The fourth claim cancels out the policy. Hey, hang on a minute. - What are you saying? - Here, in the small print. If we pay off on the tiny claim, we're through with him and we're out cheap. Hello, Mr. Addams. We'll play along with you on this. Your check will be in the next mail. Well, that was a letdown. I merely stated my position with impeccable logic and the poor devil caved in. Darling, you tend to underestimate yourself. I suppose so. I've often wondered what would happen if I turned myself loose on the world. Gomez, the world just isn't ready for you yet. Did my new cannon get here yet? Darling, we're going to have to tell him. Uncle Fester, I regret to tell you that we're going to have to punish you. You've been spending altogether too much money. Fester, you won't see another penny of your allowance until 1986. - You know what that means, don't you? - No. Not another shot do you fire in this house until you make it up. You've been whittling me down around here little by little. - But this broke the camel's back! - It's for your own good. I'm old enough to know what's for my own good. From now on I'm gonna watch out for myself. I'll get a job. "Wanted. Army Space Program. "Test pilot prepared to travel extensively. " No. I don't like army food. "Be your own boss. Are you young and ambitious? "Highest commission paid to dynamic salesmen. "Must be clean-cut, personable, fast-talker, "conservative dresser, magnetic. "Apply. Arthur J. Henson Insurance Agency. " Oh, boy. That's me! Are you sure you want to see Mr. Beesley? Oh, yes. He's looking for me. Well, go on in. Thank you. You can fill out your hospitalization claim with my secretary. Oh, but I feel fine. And dynamic and aggressive. - I'm your new salesman. - No, there's some mistake. No, those things you said in your ad, that's me. No. You have to have previous experience. Oh, I've had plenty of previous experience. I held the same job for 37 years. - Selling? - No. Public relations. Yeah. My father paid me to keep out of public. Of course, when he died I retired. Look, I'm on a very tight schedule. If you'll just leave. Oh, but I'm a great salesman. I'm magnetic. Watch. And I'm a live wire, too. Go ahead. Sell anything you like. - Oh, good. Can I have a sales kit? - Take it. - Get out of my sight. - Just like dear old Dad. Good shot, querida. That's the third bird we've lost today. Must be the nesting season, my dove. - Uncle Fester. What's wrong? - I tried. I knocked on every door in my territory. I was dynamic. I was personable, charming, and magnetic. But it wasn't any use. Oh, my career is ruined. I'm all washed-up. I have a feeling all's not well with Fester. It's hard to tell. He puts up such a brave front. Oh, yes. Oh, Uncle Fester, dear. How can you expect to lose a headache with a hot water bottle that isn't even hot? Nothing will help. Oh, Lurch. Put it over there, please. And Lurch, would you fill this up? And make sure the water is nice and scalding. That'll be all, Lurch. Now, Uncle Fester. Sit up. You'll feel a lot better after a nice hot cup of buzzard broth. No, I couldn't even get a sip down. But I have a surprise for you for lunch. Guess. Gopherloaf. Oh, I know what you're trying to do. But it's no use. Just leave me in my pain. Gomez, I'm frightened. Even when he got caught in the tunnel of love he didn't turn down his gopherloaf. I know. He thinks he's a failure. Something has to be done about it. Tish, go downstairs and keep the children away. All right, you lily-livered goldbrick! Are you going to lie there sniveling on that nice warm bed of nails? Or are you going to get up and fight like an Addams? Well, if it's all the same with you, I'd rather lie here and snivel. When a pilot crashes what does he do? He gets right back into that crate and up into the wild blue yonder again. And when a lion tamer gets ripped up, does he snivel? Does he quit? Not always. And that's what you're going to do, Fester. You're going to get up off that bed. On your feet. - Now sell your policy. - Oh, golly, Gomez. Fester, the Addams spirit! Good afternoon, sir. Or madam, as the case may be. I am your friendly, smiling insurance advisor, come to help you with your problem. - Well, go on, Fester. The rest of it. - This is as far as I ever got. I find that hard to believe. Your presentation was sharp, pithy, to the point. I've got it. I'll be the salesman and you be the customer. Now, we'll make this as real as possible. And you give me all the answers that you get. And I'll show you how to handle them. All right? Now, here we go. - Good morning, sir. - I'll buy it. I simply can't resist a sales pitch. You have got to give me the answers that you get. All right, now. We'll start from the beginning. All right? I'll even go outside. There's nobody home. - Good morning, sir. - Get lost! I'm your friendly, smiling insurance man. Beat it or I'll put the dog on you. I think I've got my sights on your problem. If something happened to you, what would become of your loved ones? Those creeps? Now, Plan A gives you the maximum coverage with the minimum expense. Will you stop bothering me? It contains total disability, hospitalization, funeral expenses, multiple casualties, plus a tax deduction and an easy payment plan. By george, Fester, that's an attractive policy. I think I'll take it myself. There we are. Congratulations, old boy. You broke the ice. You've just made a million-dollar sale, plus a lovely sales commission. - I did? - Yep. There it is. Signed, sealed and delivered. I told you I'd be a success. A million-dollar policy to Gomez Addams. - He was a pushover. - You imbecile. Don't panic. I've never seen a policy yet that Arthur J. Henson couldn't wiggle out of. In the first place, that contract is worthless until it has been notarized in the presence of two witnesses. Like it said in the sales kit, that's the first thing I had done. Look on the bright side, Arthur. It's a whopping premium. Premium. Premium. That's it! Don't accept the check. Tear it up, burn it. Paid in full. Cash. Solid gold doubloons. Well, if everything's under control, I'll get cracking again. Out! Out! Out! Gotcha, AJ. There now, Lurch. You see what a bit of poison ivy can do for a cannon? Very cheerful. As long as Uncle Fester paid for it himself, I'd like to make it look as nice as possible. Lurch. Attendez. I've come to save you some money, Mr. Addams. No. I'm the butler. Follow me. I'm Arthur J. Henson, President of the Arthur J. Henson Agency. - Dear lady. You must be Mrs. Addams. - Yes. I'm Arthur J. Henson. This is Beesley. - Charmed. Won't you be seated? - Oh, thank you. She seems okay. You can stop worrying. Mrs. Addams, we'd like to talk to your husband. Oh, I'm sorry, he's out jumping. If you'd care to wait? - Jumping? - Yes. From about 20,000 feet. But he still has his parachute. Still? Yes. You see, he has this theory. I'm not quite sure that I understand it. But he hopes to prove that if a jumper jumps using a smaller chute each time, eventually he'll need no chute at all. Well, how far along is he? He said he'd have it figured out one way or another by the end of this week. - Can I start worrying now? - Worry. Worry. Just a pinch more sulfur, children. High explosives are a tradition in the Addams family. But only here in the house, of course. My husband frets so about the children. Wouldn't dream of taking them on safari. Safari? Africa? Lions, tigers, crocodiles? Oh, nothing so adventurous. He just takes them to India and they poke around looking for cobras. You rang? Teatime, Lurch. You gentleman will stay, of course? We have something extra special today. Scorpion pâté on fresh toadstools with just gobs of divine belladonna sauce. Mama's secret mix. Surely you're not going to serve that to our client, I mean, your husband? Oh, I suppose I do baby him. I'm back. - How did it go, dear? - Oh, marvelously. All except the last two feet, and they were impossible. Dear, this is Mr. Henson and Mr. Beesley from the insurance company. How do you do? - Good to see you, old boy. - Yes. Mr. Addams, I'm going to let you off the hook. Out of the kindness of my heart I am willing to cancel your policy. Refund his premium. Dear, I thought we'd seen the last of those dust collectors. Wait a minute. Did you say cancel the policy? But why? Well, because the policy doesn't make sense. Things like this. "Double indemnity for flogging by carnivorous plant. Gunpowder burns. "Being bitten by an enraged rug. " Good old Fester. He gave me complete coverage. Yes, darling. It's very sweet of you gentlemen to be worried about us, but Would you excuse us a moment? Darling. Darling, you simply can't cancel that policy. Think of Uncle Fester. He'd be crushed. You're right, querida. Henson, I've changed my mind. - I want to double that policy. - No! No! No! In the first place, the addlepated nitwit who sold you the policy doesn't even represent us. Frankly, I don't know how you could have been taken in by such a moronic goofball. Well, here I am. Hello, HB. AJ. MA. GA. Hello, Uncle Fester. Uncle Fester? Splendid news. You've just sold another million-dollar policy. I did? By golly, you were right. I didn't need that sales kit after all. Well, I'm gonna go up to my room. Got to unwind. Go, go, go! Perfect, children! Well, I'm not gonna take this lying down. Excelso? Henson. Put me on the hot line. This is a red alert. Hello, Chief? I want to report a big swindle. Two million dollars. Addams, Gomez. That's right. Two D's. How did you know? He is? He does? We do? You are? I am? I see. Addams here. I do? I am? I can? I will. It completely slipped my mind that I own controlling interests in Excelso Corporation. The president, what's his name, just urged me to take a more active interest and make a few decisions. - Darling, why don't you? - Very well. Beesley, I like the cut of your jib. You recognized Uncle Fester's ability, and that means something to me. From now on you're my number one boy. Henson, you'll render all possible assistance to your new boss. Thank you, Lurch. Tea, gentlemen? I'm afraid not, Mrs. Addams. It's been delightful. Come on, Henson. Get cracking. Darling, I think you made the right decision. The best since I put Winthrop in charge of Addams Motors. Remember? He took a failing company and in three months ran it into bankruptcy. Dear, you could have done it in one month. Oh, Fester. How would you like to be vice-president or chairman of the board or something? There's no challenge anymore. I'm just gonna retire and play with my cannon. Watch this. Oh, dear, quick. Call the insurance man. Oh, no. I'm through paying these ridiculous claims. Fester, you're paying for this one yourself. Gladly. I have a brand new personal policy. - Oh? On what company? - Yours. Foiled again. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Oh, don't stop, please, it's so soothing. Darling, I've almost worn out the drill. Sharpen it up. Sharpen it up. Now, dear, too much of a good thing Querida, please, you were just hitting a nerve. Okay, now, just one more time. I'm sorry to spoil your fun, but something's wrong with Pugsley. He hasn't spoken a word since he came home from school. Maybe he can't think of anything to say. He's just lying there on his bed of nails, staring up at the ceiling. Perhaps the poor little tyke is all tuckered out. But he hasn't eaten anything. - Pugsley, not eaten? - No! The poor dear looks miserable. Well, he never was too attractive. Pugsley, darling, tell your mother what's wrong. - Would you rather tell your father? - Or your uncle? Oh, dear. What do we do now? We've run out of relatives. I'm in love. Pugsley in love. Oh, my baby's growing up. Don't worry, my dear. Little Casanova is a chip off the old block. I'll never forget my first crush. She was a ravishing creature of eight. But it didn't work out. First time I kissed her, we locked braces. Took the dentist two hours to pry us apart. Good shot, querida. It's depressing to see Pugsley so sad. Ruining my game. See what I mean? I simply can't get Pugsley's problem off my mind. Sad. Gomez, please, have you forgotten completely about poor little Pugsley? We must do something to cheer that boy up. - How about a new toy? - Splendid idea, my dear. I'll take care of it. You do that, darling. You're so sensible and practical. - Show me the boy who wouldn't like this. - It's beautiful, darling. - What is it? - What is it? Look. Marvelous! Not only constructive, but body-building. - What? - Not only Not only constructive, but body-building. Darling, I might have known you'd get a practical gift like this. May I try? Oh! This is marvelous. - Pugsley will have a wonderful time. - Time? What's going on here? - The new toy for Pugsley. - What? Pugsley's new toy. Will you shut that thing off? - New toy for Pugsley. - Oh, that's ridiculous. - Why? Why? - Why? He's got one already. Well, in that case, I'll have a nice talk with the boy. That's a good idea. Hey, this thing is contagious. - I'll return this thing. - No, I'll take it. Boy, this thing really works! What's the matter, darling, can't you sleep? I know, how about if I read you a nice ghost story? I don't feel like a bedtime story tonight. Oh? All right, darling, try to get some rest. Good night. Pugsley, what on earth are you doing? - I'm writing a letter. - A letter? - Scented? - Licorice, my favorite. "And the way you squint your little beady eyes is real keen. " Pugsley darling, that's no way to write a love letter. Why? What should I say? Oh, I do wish I had some of the letters your father wrote me when we were courting. Why, thank you, Thing. That's very thoughtful. Now, your father wrote some very fiery letters. Here's one. That was a little too fiery. Let's see. No, I don't think so. Perhaps you better write some letters in your own way, dear. Now, kiss Mother and run to bed. It's very late. Good night, darling. Oh, boy! Dear Teacher "Dear Teacher, this is" One of your students wrote this letter? I've always considered the Addams boy a little strange, but this letter I decided it was a matter for the principal. What's he doing in the fourth grade? There's no signature? How do you know the Addams boy wrote it? I saw him sneak it on my desk. Well, you had better see Romeo's folks about this immediately. I was hoping you'd come with me, Mr. Jennings. You're so diplomatic, assured, poised, masculine. - True, true. - And I am so bumbling, - helpless, ineffective - True, true. - Feminine. - Come, Miss Dunbar. You'll have to handle this yourself. And please, Miss Dunbar, try not to make a fool of yourself. Yes, Mr. Jennings. That kid should be writing Peyton Place. Wonderful sport, Lurch. It has its ups and downs. Just like life and love. That reminds me, - how is Pugsley? - Normal. Already forgotten his teacher. That's my Pugsley. Love them and leave them. Yes, Mr. Addams. Bring me a ladder, Lurch. Better answer the doorbell first. Yes, Mr. Addams. Pugsley's teacher. - Ahoy, Miss Dunbar! - There you are. Yes. You know me? Of course. Don't you remember that enchanted evening across the crowded PTA meeting? Never mind the ladder, Lurch. Alley-oop. How do you do? Lurch, you can take the trampoline to your room. Yes, Mr. Addams. - Tea, coffee, champagne? - Please, this is not a social visit. I have a Well, there's a letter I must read to you. Well, sit right down. Make yourself comfortable. Read away. - Some of this is embarrassing. - Really? My favorite reading. Very embarrassing. - Well, then read the parts that aren't. - There was one sentence. "When I first saw you from afar, "my heart flamed with a fierce passion, "and when you spoke French, "ooh-la-la! Ah, your radiant beauty, - "your captivating allure" - "your captivating allure, "drew me to you like honey to a suckle. " Honey to a suckle? Then you wrote this? I certainly did. Oh, Mr. Addams! I don't know what to say. I've never had an attractive man like you fall in love with me before. What? In fact, I've never had any man fall in love with me before. That's why I Mr. Addams, do you think we dare go through with this? Maybe we should stop before it's too late. Yes, we must end it. It's madness. Let it be madness! What does it matter as long as we have each other? Mr We have a guest, my dear. I'll have Lurch set an extra place for dinner. - I think I'd better explain this to my wife. - I think you better. So you see, querida, it wasn't my fault. Besides, she squeezes harder than that boa constrictor I got you for your last birthday. I can sympathize with her. I know how irresistible you are. I guess I'll have to tell her she's making a mistake. - Darling, you can't do that. - I can't? Well, of course not. It would crush her, darling. Two rejections in one day. - Two? - First Pugsley, and then you. Cara, you're such an understanding woman. It would be cruel to hurt her. You must act the part of a great lover. But if I lead her on, she'll have to know the truth eventually. "'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. " - Lincoln? - Jefferson. I'll even play the jealous wife, give it a touch of realism. Morticia, you're all woman. Yes, I know. For you, I'll do it. I can't. Querida, I can't even look at another woman. Darling, you're doing it for me. For you. Oh, darling, say it with flowers. And, Gomez, now, I know how you get carried away, so when I say "stop," stop. For you, Morticia. Miss Dunbar, my treasure. Mr. Addams, I've been thinking about us. - I'm afraid we're making a mistake. - A mistake? - Did Samson and Delilah make a mistake? - Yes. Did Antony and Cleopatra make a mistake? - Yes. - Did Romeo and Juliet make a mistake? - Yes. - Well, everyone's entitled to one mistake. - You're my only passion! - Mr. Addams. Mr Let's fly away together, to the Black Forest. - But what about your wife? - She's been there. A Black Forest summer, winter, autumn, spring - Fester, can't you see I'm busy? - Gomez, how could you? It's easy. Watch. I don't know about you, but I come from a long line of stool pigeons. Morticia! Morticia, I don't know how to tell you this, but your husband's a fake. My husband, Gomez? You got another? He's playing footsies with another woman. And when I say footsies, I don't mean footsies. Dear noble Gomez. - Noble? - He's just pretending, Uncle Fester. Pretending? Then why is he drooling so much? He has to be convincing. He sure convinced me. Having that woman laying down in his arms like that, with her hair straggling down all over her shoulders and her eyes afire and her cheeks aflame - You saw all that? - Yeah, and I only caught a glance. I do believe dear Gomez has built up that woman's ego sufficiently. - Uncle Fester, you better go tell him. - Don't worry, I know what to tell him. Oh, Uncle Fester, now, do be discreet. We don't want to offend Miss Dunbar. Just tell Gomez I said, "Don't. Stop. " - "Don't. Stop. " - He'll understand. You know me. Old dependable. I just adore finger-painting. - But, Mr. Addams, your wife. - What wife? Nobody must be allowed to intrude on our ecstasy. I can't look. Gomez, I've always loved you as a nephew. Why not? I'm your uncle. But you're not yourself, Gomez. I can tell just by touching you. Suddenly you're hard and cold. But if you won't listen to me, perhaps you will listen to Morticia. I should have put out the "don't disturb" sign. There you are. Sorry. The Black Forest is indescribable. Let me tell you about it. - Morticia says, "Don't stop. " - Don't stop? Thanks. What was I saying before we were interrupted? Oh, yes. I was saying that nobody must be allowed to interrupt. Morticia! - Morticia, we've lost him. - He didn't stop? - Didn't even break stride. - Oh, dear. Oh, here, Uncle Fester, finish this for me. - Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling. Ivy-covered cottage beside a lovely swamp. - But, Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling. We can find our own little secluded hideaway, far from everyone, where the magic stillness of the night is broken only by the merry buzzing of the tsetse fly. - But, Mr. Addams - Yes, my darling. - What is it? - You're breaking my back. - Gomez. - Excuse me. - Well, what do you think? - I think it's dreadful. Well, I was doing a lot better until her back gave out. - I'll show you what I mean. - Gomez, what's gotten into you? - You're acting disgracefully. - I am? Yes, you are. It's as though you don't care at all. - It's as bad as that? - It most certainly is! - Lf you'd only make some effort - Just watch me. I'll show you what the man you married is really like. Oh, what have I done? Our wonderful life together, our magical moments, gone, broken, smashed to bits. Pardon me. Good God, Morticia, what a performance! Worthy of a Sarah Bernhardt, a Greta Garbo, a Mamie Van Doren. Oh, Gomez, why? Why? Why? Why not? Why not? Why not? How was that? Oh, but enough of this small talk! My heart belongs to what's-her-name! Please, Gomez, please, dear, think of all of our happy moments together. A sham! Where were we? - Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling. Can't you see it's all over between us? Gomez, I'm leaving this house and taking the children with me. Go ahead and leave! - Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling. Take the children. Take the neighbors' children. Take Uncle Fester. Take Mama. - She's your mama. - Very well, we'll share custody. But I get full custody of Lurch. Mr. Addams. There you are. Mr. Addams, will you please pick me up? Yes, of course. It will be you and me. Mr. Jennings. Miss Dunbar. Sir, if you're a jealous husband or boyfriend, the whole thing was a mistake. - An April fool joke. - An April fool joke in October? I like to get an early start. - My glasses. Where are my glasses? - Where did you drop them, Miss Dunbar? - I didn't drop them, they just flew off. - Flew Why, Isobel, you have beautiful eyes. Sir, you are leading this poor, lovesick girl on, and I just want to say, good luck. Querida, I was just carrying out your instructions. But I pleaded with you to stop. I thought you were acting. Believe me, cara mia, when you spoke to me in French, it was all I could do to restrain myself. What was it you said? Speak some more French. - Anything! - Hush, my darling. Oh, my poor darling one, it must have been torture for you, making love to that strange woman all the time, while you were longing for me, and I made you do it. Oh, can you ever forgive me, darling, can you? - Yes, if you get me a pulmotor. - Of course, dear, for Christmas. - But I - Hush, my darling. Oh, dear. I ruined your newspaper. Think nothing of it. It's last week's. That's very sensible, dear. I understand they're much cheaper. Much. Oh, the mail is in. Thank you, Thing. Oh, it's from dear Miss Dunbar. Did she get over me? - Completely. - She did? - Pugsley, where are you going? - To mail a letter. - Oh, to who? - My new teacher. I hope this one isn't as fickle. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Uncle Fester, what're you doing? Well, I'm waxing my head. It's all part of the national beautification program. The national beautification program? Yes, it was on TV. You see, the White House wants everybody to join in making everything in the country more beautiful. And did you ever see my head look more beautiful? Oh, yes, it is lovely. Yeah, it's that hard coat. That's very patriotic of you, Uncle Fester. I think Gomez and I should join in the program, too. Besides, there are a lot of lovely things I've been wanting to buy. - Three oranges! - Oh, what did you get, dear? Three oranges! How's the unpacking coming? These shopping sprees are so exhausting. What's in this alligator case? An alligator. Nice pet for Pugsley. No. I'm thinking of doing this room over, dear, in sort of Early Zoo. That sounds wonderful. We do have a good start, but tampering with perfection? It's all part of the national beautification program, dear. I think everyone should do their bit. But I would like to bring beauty into the lives and homes of others as well. Who better than you, cara mia, with your exquisite taste, to do that. Darling. But in order to inspire confidence, I need a showplace, a model home. Querida, you've got one right here. No, darling. This house is a tribute to generations of Addams taste. It took years to achieve its rare beauty. I should start from scratch. Just arrived. Yes, thank you, Lurch. Let's see. Put it over there, please. Carefully. Carefully, don't bump it now. Oh, yes. Gently, Lurch, gently. Thank you. That'll be all. - Darling, look. - What is it? Can't you guess? We've never seen a canary that size before. I'll give you a hint. Tish, that sound sets my blood afire. Mating cry of the Transylvanian vulture. It is a Transylvanian vulture. We should get a pair. Oh, but I ordered two. You naughty bird. Morticia, you have impeccable taste. Well, of course. I married you, didn't I? You know, sometimes I think it's wrong of me to keep you all to myself in a world starved for beauty. I know what you mean. For instance, our next-door neighbor, Mrs. Digby? Every time she passes this house, she stares at it with that expression on her face that I've come to know so well. Raw envy. We certainly are surrounded by great beauty. We should insure it. That reminds me, isn't what's-his-name, Digby, our next door neighbor, isn't he an insurance man? Let's give him the business. - You mean, our good neighbor policy? - Exactly. But first, let me hear that wild music of the vulture's cry. Darling, you promise you'll try to control yourself? I'll try. - They're at it again. - Take it easy, honey. After all, we never see them. Well, it's almost worse this way, just hearing them. We won't live next door to them forever. Joe, we've been living next door to them for three weeks now and it seems like forever already. We have got to get away. Now! Joe, please. - Look, honey. - Please. Well, okay. But if I don't get some business soon, we'll have to move again. Into the street. Well, even that would be an improvement. - I think I'm gonna go lie down. I just - Yeah. Come in, the door is open. Aha there, Digby! Gomez Addams here. My wife, Morticia, there. How do you do, Mr. Digby? - Won't you sit down, Mrs. Addams? - No, thank you, Mr. Digby. We'll come right to the point. We'd like for you to insure our collection of objets d'art. That's French. Gomez, darling, please. Darling, please. Insurance now, objets later. You want to insure something? Yes, indeed. How about 1,000,000? Dollars? That's very interesting. How often do you have to water that table? I'll draw up the papers immediately. No hurry. Just bring them by the house tomorrow. And bring Mrs. Digby with you. She's very shy. Yes, I can tell that by the way she rushes past our house. Besides, she's busy on our new home, working with decorators, you know. Then you'll have to bring her. Mrs. Addams is a superb decorator. I'd be delighted to help. - Help? - Yes. I'd not only feel I was helping a neighbor, but I'd be serving my country as well. Oh, yes. Sure. If I know my wife, you'll get much more than you bargained for. Darling. Good day, Mr. Digby. Digby, until tomorrow. - All right now, Fester, you ready? - Yeah. One, two, three, heave! Came out nice and clean. I don't understand. Delilah here gave the room such a lift. - But Morticia needs her. - What for? Housewarming gift for our neighbors, the Digbys. The Digbys! Well, what about asking me first? After all, blood is thicker than water. Who said anything about giving blood? After all, we don't know them that well. The Digbys, that's all that Morticia thinks about now. Well, Morticia always does give too much of herself. She does? Maybe she will give blood. No. Here it is, Morticia. Isn't that beautiful? I'm glad you're not giving them our live vulture, that'd be too much. Even parting with Delilah leaves a hole in my life. You should see the wall. That must be the Digbys. I'm almost afraid to let them see the house. Might discourage them. Darling, they're just going to have to be realistic. After all, when we first moved in here, this house was bleak and gloomy. Not everyone can start with that advantage. The Digbys. Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is Mrs. Digby. - How do you do. - Mrs. Digby, we have a little something for you. Say, that call is catching. - Won't you sit down? - Oh, yes. Poor dear is overcome by it all. Now, just take a nice, deep breath. Save a little for me. - Joe, let's get out of here. - Yes, dear. Soon as we sign the papers. Digby, how can you talk business at a time like this? Besides, we haven't had a chance to get acquainted yet. Well, you see, I'm a little tired You know, moving into a new house and finding a decorator Digby, didn't you tell her? - Tell me what? - You've found your decorator. - I have? Who? - Me. Hey, you've got a real fainter there. Very feminine. She's such a shy, sensitive soul. I know we're going to get along famously. No more smelling salts. I feel better when I'm under. Look, there must be some mistake. It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it? At your husband's urging, I've decided to do your house myself. My husband's urging? Surprise! Well, now, if you ladies will excuse us, Mr. Digby and I will repair to the gallery. I'd like to show him our new art objects. Digby. Now, dear. I have some wonderful ideas for your new house. And a most unusual color scheme. - Oh? - We'll start with the carpet. Black. - Black? - Pitch. Perhaps as a base - I suppose the curtains - Black. - What about the wallpaper? - Black. And the furniture coverings? Black? No. Off-black. You must have some contrast, you know. - Well, Digby, here's our gallery. - Gallery? Now, what were you saying about insurance? Oh, all you have to do is sign and I'll have the company issue a floater. No problem. You rang? A pen, please, Lurch. Oh, thank you. That'll be all, Lurch. - There you are, Digby. - Gee, thanks. Thanks a million. Oh, boy. Beautiful, beautiful. You know, I can hardly wait to see that collection of artworks of yours. You don't have to wait. You're surrounded by them. These things? I mean, these things. Over here, Digby. - An original Rembrandt. - Rembrandt? This says "Flugelsmith. " By george, it does. These scribbled signatures. Well, it's an original Flugelsmith. Speaking of originals, feast your eyes on this. Oh, a Stradivarius? If it isn't, I'm out $12. 50. And, of course, there's my head of Tigi-Tigi, the Polynesian war chief. - Bronze? - Shrunken. Now, as to your bedroom, I was thinking we might do the walls in salmon. - Pink? - No, scales. How's the distaff side doing? Oh, never mind about us. Did he sign, Joe? All signed, sealed and delivered. - Well, nice to have seen you. - Oh, but we're not even halfway through. You haven't seen the lovely material I have for your new den. - Hand-woven gunnysack. - Good thinking, my dear. Well, Mrs. Addams, you're very kind, but those lovely ideas of yours are too rich for my blood. Blood. That's exactly the color I planned for your guestroom. I've decided to live with the things I have for a few more years. Well, arrivederci. Now, what was that all about? It's obvious, darling. Money. Great Caesar's ghost, you're right. That's why they were so overcome when they saw our house. They couldn't afford it and they were too proud to admit it. The poor darlings. They were even too proud to accept our lovely gift. That must really have broken their hearts. Let's send it over to their home. We'll have Lurch deliver it. Hey, wait a minute. Why don't you ask me? Excellent idea, Fester. You deliver it. No, I meant, ask me whether I happen to want it. Why, of course you do. But that's the only kind of gift that's worth giving. Something that means something to you. I don't like giving away precious family heirlooms. Lurch, get the car. We'll take something else over there instead. Some of that junky furniture we got up in the attic. Antique Sheraton sideboard they stuck up there. I know it's awful, but, you know, beggars can't be choosers. And the first one that blabs anything about this to Morticia is a rotten egg. No, better make that a spoilsport. I like rotten eggs. - Hi. - Wow. Watch it, Lurch. Narrow there. What's this? Just a little housewarming present. Mrs. Addams thought you might prefer this to a stuffed vulture. Prefer it? Why, isn't that an authentic Sheraton? - Well - Why, that must be priceless! Well, I think it's worth something. I must telephone Mrs. Addams immediately. No. He's right. I wouldn't do it. - Why not? - Well Morticia hates expressions of gratitude. We'll just give her your message. Bye! Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello? Mrs. Addams, your beautiful gift just arrived. I wanted to fill your home with things of equal beauty. Nothing could make me happier, but we just don't have that kind of money. Oh, think nothing of the expense, dear. I have more things than I can use. How can I ever thank you? It's I who should be thanking you for letting me do my part in the national beautification program. Well, whatever you say. Joe and I are gonna be gone for a month and we won't be in your way, the whole house is yours. Oh, I know after that lovely gift you sent over, you're gonna surprise me. Oh, I will. I will. - Have a good trip, dear. - Thank you. Thank you. Darling, I have decided to let Mrs. Addams do our new house after all. Who are you calling? Either a divorce lawyer or a psychiatrist, whichever one can get here first. Mrs. Addams was just having her little joke. Little joke, eh? What makes you think so? - That's what makes me think so. - Oh. - A housewarming gift from the Addams. - Well Gomez, darling. I've had an inspiration for the new Digby house. Those lucky devils. What is it this time? I want to bring the garden right into the living room. - Glass walls, eh? - No, dirt floor. There you are, Gomez. Darling, I've just had the most marvelous idea about the Digby house. You know, those big bay windows in the library, I'm going to have them all cemented in, walled up. You think they'll like that? Mrs. Digby will. No window washing. Gomez, darling, you're going to be so proud of me. I have an idea for the Digby house that will be my piece de résistance. French. Darling, please, later. Let me tell you my idea first. - Let me tell you mine. - Mine comes first. Oh, that idea. Now, darling, what is the most wasted space in a house? - The ceiling. - No, dear, the cellar. - Of course. - I've solved it. I've had Lurch go over to the Digbys' and flood it. - Flood it? - An indoor swimming pool. Tish, you've done it! The model American home. Not yet. There's still the landscaping. Yes, the landscaping. Darling, I want you to see this with your own eyes. Would you believe it? That garden used to be full of roses and geraniums and unsightly camellias, and, in just one week, Lurch and I did that. - That's a miracle. - Thank you, darling. Beautiful touch, my dear. Well, when Mrs. Digby sees all this, I'll have the smelling salts ready. Darling, there's a car driving up. It must be the Digbys. Welcome home. Digbys! Welcome home. Well, what do you two think of your little love nest now? What did I tell you? Excellent idea, my dear. To leave the Digbys in private to savor the beauty of their new home. I do hope it didn't take Mr. Digby too long to revive her. He must be an old hand at it by now. - Are you expecting anyone, dear? - I certainly am. A whole parade of people on the Digbys' recommendation. The Digbys. - Mrs. Addams - Please, say no more. I can read your feelings on your face. Mrs. Addams, I can understand some of the things you did to my house, but why? Why a wrecked car right smack in the middle of the living room? I knew that would get them. You see, I feel that a person's home should reflect their personality. A wrecked car? Well, that reflects your husband's work in insurance. Pretty clever. Did you notice the crushed fenders? That is the original rust on them. - I think I'm gonna faint again. - Could you hold it a moment, please? We have a small favor to ask. Well, I have a bigger favor. You can take all that stuff But that's just the favor we were going to ask you. You can take all that That That was the favor you were gonna ask us? Well, it's more in the nature of a sacrifice for your country. You see, we want to make your home a showplace. Open it to the public. It's all part of the national beautification program. Of course, we insist on your having a profit. Please, please, anything you say. It's a deal. Real Americans, eh, darling? And if there's anything you'd like to keep, why, I'm sure we can replace it. Oh, well, now, there was just one piece. I don't know what happened to it. It was a Sheraton sideboard. Oh, that. It was obviously a mistake. You like that? I thought it was rather, you know, amusing. - Say no more. We have a whole atticful. - It's all yours. Now, now we can really get to work on your new home. Just a minute. - You see, we're planning on leaving town. - Oh, yeah. Well, perhaps I can be of some assistance. - Gomez has interests all over the world. - He has? Well, there must be one place he doesn't have any interests. Come to think of it there is one. Timbuktu. Funny thing you should mention Timbuktu. That's just where we're going. Isn't that strange? Gomez, darling. Does it strike you as odd that nobody has been inside my model home? They just glance in the door and walk on. Well, the house is obviously too far ahead of its time. Frank Lloyd Wright had the same problem. I don't even think the Digbys appreciated it. - Nice people, but a bit crude. - Yes. That Sheraton sideboard was a dead giveaway. At least they helped us clean the rest of the stuff out of the attic. What's the matter, darling? No more sword swallowing? The thought of that Digby house in Timbuktu ruined my appetite. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Nothing like a musical hammer. Tish! I've got you under the mistletoe. Oh, for crying out loud, Gomez! Don't you know the difference between Morticia and me? I do now. You're a lot softer. You're under the mistletoe. Can sure tell Christmas is coming around. Everybody's getting kiss-happy. I wrapped another present. Oh, Uncle Fester, you did it beautifully. It's so you. It's a knack. Dear Uncle Fester. He's such a sentimental softy, but he tries to hide it. There's plenty of room to hide it in. Thank you, darling. Merry Christmas. Now, I must wrap some more Christmas packages. Oh, darling, I want to show you. This is for Mama. Do you think she'll like it? Oh! Head of Cousin Caliban. Beautiful! It certainly flatters him. I wonder if I should've had the sculptor do his other head, as well? No, this is plenty. Oh, darling, and this is for Lurch. Look. Wonderful idea! Timesaver, too. He can work and eat at the same time. Also saves on dishwashing. And this is for my sister Ophelia. Her favorite perfume, Holiday Macabre. Christmas present. Oh, how jolly, Lurch! Who is it from? Maharaja of Manipuri. Good old Maharaj, What did you send him this year, dear? His weight in rubies plus a copy of the Air Force reducing diet. Put it over there on the table, please, Lurch. Thank you, Thing. I can hardly wait to see what the old boy sent. A basket! And a flute. And a turban. I got it! A headless flute player. No, no, no, darling. Here, let me show you. Interesting. You got to hand it to the Maharaja, he sure knows what to get for the man who has everything. Let me try. Thank you. Everybody's a critic. - Perhaps another piece of music, dear. - Of course! - What's that? - Oh, hello, darlings. That's a Christmas present for your father. Don't tell us it came from Santa Claus. And why not? Because Mr. Thompson next door said there is no such thing as Santa Claus. What? That neighbor of ours isn't very neighborly telling the children that. Remember, children, it was old Thompson who told you there weren't any witches on Halloween. And we produced a beautiful witch for you, Aunt Singe. - But she was a relative. - Oh, well, that doesn't matter. If a witch can come, so can Santa. You mean, he's going to be here tonight? With all his lovely reindeer. Donder and Blitzen and Darling, what are the names of those reindeer? Winken, Blinken and Nod? No. - Tom, Dick and Harry? - No. Well, the point is, children, there is a Santa Claus. - Isn't there? - Of course there is. I hope he brings me a new Marie Antoinette doll for my guillotine. Oh, that is fun. A bow and arrow for me. I'd like to shoot apples off of Uncle Fester's head. That's a nice, clean sport. But remember, children, be careful. If you hit Uncle Fester's head, you can ruin the arrow. Going to hang someone? Pugsley, you know this tree has tradition. It's been in the family since Gomez was a little boy. So nice and gloomy. Yeah, and without all those little sharp needles, it's got plenty of room for Santa to hang more presents on. Uncle Fester, do you believe in Santa Claus? Well, of course. You kids are talking like children. But Mr. Thompson said there is no Santa. Next thing he'll be telling you is there's no dragon. We wouldn't believe that. Come on, Wednesday. Thank goodness they've not been completely corrupted. Uncle Fester, it was so good of you not to disillusion the children. Well, gosh, I'm no crackpot. But what if Santa doesn't show up? After all, our children do have much more than they need. It could destroy their faith in everything. The astronauts have a back-up team. We'll have a back-up Santa Claus. - Yeah. We'll need somebody who's fat. - And jolly. - Someone who knows children. - And can talk to them on their own level. Golly, I wish I knew somebody. - I got it! Lurch! - No, he's a little too tall. - Cousin Itt! - A little too short. I got just the one. Pugsley! No, that's no good. - We know who. - Who? - You. - Me? Yes. I'm going to look up costumers in the classified. Let's see. Cosmetics, cosmonauts Costumers! Here we are. Kaski's Costumes. Thank you, Thing. Hello? Is this Kaski's Costumers? This is Mrs. Addams calling. I'd like to rent a Santa Claus costume, please. Very well. I'll send the subject right over. Morticia, this is silly. I'm not the Santa Claus type. I'm too young and glamorous. Do you want the children to have broken hearts? Gomez, don't soft-soap me. Their hearts are stronger than mine. Of course, they are children. And children's dreams can be shattered. Sometimes, it can affect their whole lives. Affect it? It can ruin them. That's what it'll probably do, wreck their whole lives. Kaski's Costumers, here I come! That's what I like about old Fester. In a family crisis, he's always calm, cool and collected. Perfect! How nice and jolly it is to be trimming the tree and to have all the old family decorations. That reminds me, shouldn't Fester be here by now? Never fear, darling. Uncle Fester is always dependable. May I have another one of those balls, dear, please? Mama's favorite. Oh, yes, dear Mama. She's so sentimental, she never throws anything away. Perhaps Fester stopped by to pick up gifts for the children? Perhaps. That was French. Darling, please, not on the ladder! May I have Mama's stocking, please? - Mama wears this? - Only when she dresses up. Let's see now. There, that's perfect. Mama always insists on having her stocking on the tree. Well, Tish, you've done it again. Darling. Children! Just in time. Do you think Santa will really come? Do we think Cara mia, tell them. He should have been here over an hour ago. Hope he doesn't get stuck in the chimney. Pugsley, old boy, we're talking about Santa Claus, not Uncle Fester. Good! Come on, Pugsley! Isn't that sweet? They want to give Santa a warm welcome. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la, la la la la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la, la la la la Don we now our gay apparel Fa la la, fa la la, la la la Troll the ancient Yuletide carol Fa la la la la, la la la la Tish, you sing like a robin. Gomez. Sorry, I meant like a raven. Now, run along upstairs, darlings, and wait for Santa to come. Probably scouting the house for a landing right now. I don't think Santa's going to get here tonight. If he was, he'd be here by now. Nonsense. You remember Santa Claus' motto. "Through hail or sleet or dark of night" Oh, no, that's the postman. Well, no matter. They both deliver things. I don't think Santa's going to deliver anything here tonight. Well, we better get up to bed as Mother says, or he definitely won't be here. You never should have trusted Fester to play Santa. You're right, Cousin Itt. Fester is the balance wheel of the family. He must have broken his axle somewhere. We must get a Santa Claus for the children. We can't let them down. Got to get a Santa for the children. A Santa Claus for the children. For the children. Turkey dinners at the mission! How's business? Terrible. If things keep on like this, we're going to be serving turkey dinners without the turkey. Well, brace up, old man. I'm here to help. - You mean, you want to make a donation? - Well, in a manner of speaking. Let's see. That ought to be about size 42. Forty-four, but if you're thinking of buying this suit, it's not for sale. Of course not. I just want to rent it for a while. How much would you take? Twenty-five. That's fair enough. Twenty-five thousand. Mister, you don't need this suit. Turkey dinners at the mission! Turkey dinners at the mission! Dear Santa, we just wanted you to know that even though Mr. Thompson said there was no such thing as Santa Claus, we didn't believe him. So please come, or else it will make us look like dummies. Signed Wednesday and Pugsley Addams. - Do you see what I see? - Santa Claus? - Sure looks like him. - I thought he came down the chimney. - Maybe he took a shortcut. - Sure answers letters fast. I think he's trying to tell us something. Merry Christmas, children! Merry Christmas! Well, well, little boy and girl, what might your names be? - I'm Wednesday Addams. - I'm Pugsley Addams. Addams, eh? One of my favorite names. I've often thought of changing my own name to Santa Addams. But you know tradition. People like the Claus. Well, this is for you, little girl. Gee, just what I wanted. And this is for you, young man. - Gosh, thanks, Santa. - Thanks, Santa. - Thank you very much! - Thank you very much! Have fun, kids. Remember, there is a Santa Claus. Merry Christmas! Hey, Donder! Hey, Blitzen! Let's get moving! - Who's there? - It's Santa Claus. Oh, what a night! Hunched up in that cramped sleigh, yelling at those lazy reindeers and trying to read addresses from 200 feet in the air. What are you staring at? Didn't you ever see me before? Sure, just a minute ago, but your voice sure has changed. You must have me mixed up with some other fellow. Either that's Grandmama, or Santa Claus is a woman. Either that, or Grandmama is a man. You still think I was just here? Well, kids are always imagining things. Here you are. Here you go. And don't let your imagination run away with you. Well, I've got to get going. Merry Christmas! Two dolls! Boy, two bows and arrows! Maybe we ought to give one of these back to some poor child. Well, maybe, seeing as it's Christmas. Let's go down and see if there is anything else under the tree. Merry Christmas. For you, Pugsley. And Wednesday. No thank-you for Santa? You sure have grown. You sure you aren't Lurch? Santa Claus. My imagination's running wild. Mine, too. Just a moment. Come on, Wednesday. There's something mighty peculiar going on around here. That's Lurch. I could tell by his smile. Well, if they want to play, then we'll play. Come on. Look, Mr. Santa Claus, we think two presents are too much. Now you give us three. Santa gives one. Merry Christmas. I don't think Santa counts very well. Santa counts fine, but I'm not so sure about Lurch. And a Merry Christmas to you, too. Santa? If that isn't Cousin Itt, Santa's shrunk again. - And a Merry Christmas to you, too, Santa. - To you, too, Santa. Merry Christmas! Well, if there aren't two lovely children waiting for old Santa to arrive. And here I am. Look at what I've brought you. Where did you get those lovely things? These aren't lovely. They aren't? No, we're just imagining it. Yeah, we even imagined there's a whole run on Santa Clauses. I am the only true Santa Claus. Oh, yeah? Well, who's that? - Santa Claus! - Santa Claus! Somebody call me? Are you sure you're the one and only Santa? Of course! These two are impostors. I shall have them removed. You rang? Who are you? Never mind who he is. Who are you? - Who do I look like? - You look like me. Who are you? Like you? Who are you? - Santa Claus? - Santa Claus? Coming! Well Here I am, bruised, braised and fricasseed, but still on the job. And I see all my assistants are on the job, too. And here are your presents. Thank you, Uncle Fester. Uncle Fester? Who's he? That's you. And that's Mother and that's Father and that's Grandma and that's Lurch and that's Cousin Itt. The jig's up! It was nice of you to do this, but it's too bad the real Santa never got here. Oh, I'm sorry, darlings, but Look! - Who's been working on the tree? - Not me. - Not me. - I haven't been near it. Nor I. Well, if it wasn't you, Cousin Itt, it must have been Snow! But it isn't snowing outside. By george, the real Santa must have gotten here while our backs were turned. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Gomez, thank you again. This is such a sensible Christmas gift. The minute I saw it, I said, "That's Morticia. " Darling. Gomez, dear, aren't you going to use the cigar lighter I gave you for Christmas? Of course. Best cigar lighter I ever had. - Hi, Gomez. - Dear Uncle Fester. Were you able to change Pugsley's bows and arrows for a chemistry set? Yeah. I showed him how to use it, too. Taught him how to mix just the right combination of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter. Makes wonderful fudge. - Fudge? It makes gunpowder! - Oh, don't be I could've sworn it made fudge. - Wonderful Christmas. - Yes, darling. - There's only one thing missing. - Querida, what? That. We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family See the spider on the maypole Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la That was lovely, darling. Those old English madrigals are enchanting. A bit sentimental, but lovely. Madrigals. Paintings. I should've gone on that toad hunt with Mama. How long do I have to hold this silly pose, Morticia? We'll take a break in a few minutes, Uncle Fester. Just hold still. My dear, there is no end to your talents. That is Uncle Fester. The twinkle in the eye, the inscrutable smile. Darling, I haven't even started on Uncle Fester yet. To be sure. But then, you've always had a way with skulls. Uncle Fester, what are you doing with my piggy bank? Is that your piggy bank? It doesn't look like a pig. Anyway, I'm posing. Don't you ever spend any money? Your mother is painting the gravedigger scene from Hamlet. "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio. " That's one of the most hilarious things old Shakespeare ever wrote. He always tickled me so. Mama's landed. Seems mighty careless. We'd better have a look. Oh, man. Like, where am l? Oh, forget it, Dad. I know. Nice and clammy. You had us frightened, young man. You got me a little frightened right now, but a couple of aspirin and it's gonesville for you spooks. Spooks! Well, now, there's no need for flattery. Thank you. I think I'd better get him some of Mama's painkillers. They're absolutely unbelievable. Hey, you cats are for real. Cats? Well, you must mean Kitty. She's real, all right. Oh, man, I'm wracked up worse than I thought. Nonsense. You'll be all right. A couple of clean breaks, but Uncle Fester will have you fixed up in no time. -Right! -I better see about those pills. -All right. Cool it, man. I'm fine. I'm okay. -Glad to hear it, son. Your motorcycle's fine, too. Frame was cracked in a couple of spots, but I welded them up. Oh, the bike. You'll need a new drive chain, too. Yeah, well, just send the bill to the dead-letter office, will you? Hey, look, before I cut out of here, fill me in, will you? What's with all these oddballs around here? Oddballs? What oddballs? They went thataway. Oh, this I gotta see. You kids really live in this crumb box? We like it. It's so nice and eerie. I wish I could say as much for the coop I just flew. You mean you don't like your home? Oh, sure, sure. Like a stir bird loves his cell. -Dig? -Only graves. You break me up, sawed-off. Look, where's my box? That's pretty. Could you please play some more, sir? Look, catch my act at Carnegie Hall, will you? Children, who wants to help Mother pluck the albatross? -I do! It's my turn! -It's my turn! Here we are. Swallow this pill. You'll be a new man. I'd rather stick with the old one. Look, you take it. Well, thank you. By Jove, that hit the spot. I really needed that. What's this? Don't tell me. A modern streamlined flail. A flail? We seem to have mutual interests. I'm a devotee of weaponry, too. Much to be said for the sturdy design of the older model, but for skull-point accuracy I'll take this one anytime. Are you putting me on, man? "Putting me on. " You certainly turn a colorful phrase. -Look, don't bug me. -Bug me. Sounds Elizabethan. I'll have to check that. Mrs. Addams and I are fascinated by the study of language and philology. And your jacket is very interesting, too. Nice touch of an ancient coat of arms. -Who's your tailor? -Tailor? -War surplus. -War surplus? Listen, man, I need that part. But pronto, so I'm not fooling around with no peasant. Get me the top cat, like right now. I'm so sorry the young man wouldn't join us. Yes. Casserole of spleen is tastier than ever, Lurch. It's that pinch of hemlock, sir. Darling, have you noticed how much livelier things have been since our young friend dropped in? Yes, just being with a fine, upstanding man like that makes you feel good all over, doesn't it? Listen, meathead, I don't care if you are the top cat. Like, I want some action, huh? It's only a crummy motorcycle part, so let's get with it, man. Well, check and double-check, will you? Why don't you geese get organized? Never heard such descriptive language. Such rhythm. Such cadence. A complete individualist. And we thought good breeding was a thing of the past. I dig him the most. Crazy. See, it's all a matter of exposure. It's rubbing off on them already. How soon can you get it over here? Tomorrow? But, man, you don't know what I'm up against. I'll go ape if I have to have to drag my anchor around here till tomorrow. Any news, Rocky? Oh, yeah, like, the greatest. Splendid. Perhaps you can join us after all. No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Come, now. Show me the man who can resist my dear wife's puree of sea slug. You're looking at him. -How do you feel about braised giraffe? -Awful. Look, look, I'll dig you people later. I'm gonna cut out for a pad somewhere. And if the motorcycle part gets here, well, then l -What's the matter, Rocky? -My knee, my knee. Well, you're lucky it happened here. Morticia's a great hand at first aid. Born with a red thumb. -You rang? -Lurch, hot oil and plenty of it. And a good stout length of rope. And Lurch, don't forget the leeches. GOMEZ: Better dust off the rack. How is our little patient? Nothing like a good, old-fashioned pillory for complete rest. My dear? Uh-huh. You're still feeling any pain? Lady, after this I don't even feel my leg. Good. A sign of healing. Here we are. I'm sure you'll be very comfortable on this. You wanna bet? Can't beat this for solid comfort. Yeah, solid. Now, Rocky, I'm sure you're very tired and you'd like to rest. If there's anything else you want, just shriek. Come on, curly. How much longer on this gig? Cool it, Rock. Couple of flips of the wrist and coolsville. I'll grab my gear. No one, but no one, can capture the wistful expression of a hyena Iike you, dear. Tish? Tish? Woolgathering again? I'm sorry, darling. I was just thinking. About Rocky? Mmm. You know, the children are becoming very fond of him. Yes. And he can't quite hide his affection for them, either. He's brought charm and individuality into our lives. I wish we could keep him. Mmm. Well, that does it. I'm going to fire off a strongly-worded letter to the editor. It's about time. That's the third day this week that paper's been late. Yes, I can understand one day, or even two, but Well, well, listen to this, Morticia. "Organizer of the giant merger is well-known tycoon "Rockland Cartwright ll. " Does that ring a bell? Yes, I believe it does. That's your vulture's feeding bell. I was talking about Just a minute. -You rang? -Yes, Lurch. Would you be a good chap and fetch me the registration slip on Rocky's motorcycle, please? Thank you, Lurch. You may go. Excellent servant. Anticipates my every wish. And so cheerful, too. Just as I thought. Rockland Cartwright lll. And our tycoon is Rockland Cartwright ll. Obviously father and son. Darling, you're right again. Hey, Rocky, wanna help us make some hand grenades? It's for a surprise attack. It'll be a blast. Look, the only blast that I'm doing is off this pad. You mean you're cutting out? WEDNESDAY: Please stay, Rocky. Stay here? Look, nothing, but nothing, could make me stay here. ROCKY: My dad! Except for one thing, and he's heading for this door. -Who's that? -Never mind. But look, kids Look, he's gonna ask for me, so you kids tell him you never saw me before. Dig? Well? Gee, Rocky, we couldn't do that. It would be lying. So what? Look, kids, I'm in a tough spot. Mr. Cartwright, your son has run away three times already. Sergeant, I've just got to find that son of mine. So this time I'll do all the talking. -You just try to look halfway intelligent. -Yes, Mr. Cartwright. Well, well. Hello, children. Have you seen a young man with a black jacket and a black leather cap? Carrying a guitar? Riding a motorcycle? Riding a motorcycle? That's right. Have you seen him? -Nope. -Nope. Another blank. But I know he was last seen in this neighborhood. -Put on another five men. -Yes, sir. Things are heating up a bit. Okay, bring on the hand grenades. -Wild. -Wild. Darling, did you notice this? Today is Rocky's birthday. By George, that's true. Darling, he's done so many nice things for us. I think the least we could do is give him a surprise birthday party. Capital. Now, let's see, there'll be ourselves and the children, and Uncle Fester, and Lurch, and Rocky's father Rocky's father? Well, of course. It wouldn't be the boy's birthday without his father here. Yes. By thunder, I can't wait to see the expression on old Cartwright's face when we tell him. What? Yes, you're quite right. I'd love to attend my son's birthday party. Where? Don't worry. I'll be there all right. Even over the phone breeding will tell. Like father, like son. Now, darling, we want this to be a real surprise to Rocky. So I'll instruct the children to keep it an absolute secret. They're not to tell a living soul, or anyone else, for that matter. -We know a secret. -We know a secret. -We know a secret. -We know a secret. Satan's coming to dinner. That was last week. Look, I'm gonna lay a little secret on you, kids. I am gonna blow this popcorn stand. We thought you liked it here. You just can't go. Why not? 'Cause we're having a birthday party for you. But we're not supposed to tell you 'cause it's a surprise. A birthday party for me? For me? Sure, Rocky. It's your birthday. Well, you kids laid a big favor on me. I guess I can do the same for you. I'll stick around. PUGSLEY: Good! Follow me. LURCH: Wait here. Who's the manager of this broken-down funhouse? No need to tell us, sir. Rockland Cartwright ll, allow me to present my lovely wife, Morticia. Never mind that. Where is that good-for-nothing son of mine? Mr. Cartwright, what charming modesty. I demand that you release him Good heavens, another one. You can call me Uncle Fester. I'd rather call the Marines. Now you get Rocky out here this minute or I'll Oh, no, that would spoil everything. You are going to be the big surprise. You see, the plan is for you to hide behind the aspidistra. I did not come here to play games. Behind the aspidistra. Bully for you, Uncle Fester! Oh, come on, Gomez. You got to do it last time. All right, Fester, have a go at it. Rocky? Would you come down here a minute, dear? All right, Fester, let her rip. GOMEZ: Happy birthday. Like a solid riff for another year, Rocksville. Thank you, Mr. Addams. Lay it on me, Rock. Like we're the samesville. And now, scattered about, very cleverly concealed, are your gifts. All you have to do is find them. Go on to it, Rock. This is what I've always wanted, too. -These are the best presents I ever -Wait, Rock. There's one more. Yes. Go look. You're getting cool, dear. Now you're getting warmer. Much warmer. You're getting hot. Very hot. You're burning up. Thanks a lot, Mr. and Mrs. Addams, you Nonsense. We've already been thanked. Come on, Son. I'm getting you out of this rookery. Listen, knock it off. These people are my friends. Friends? Why, they're a bunch of kooks. Well, they're my kind of kooks and they dig me the way I am. No rebuild jobs like Okay, okay. Bring on the handcuffs. No more handcuffs, son. Key to your motorcycle. You're free to go, if that's what you want. That's what I want. I'll grab my gear. CARTWRlGHT: You people accepted the boy just as he is. I tried to press him into a mold. If there's a kook around here, it must be me. -Well, I'll get out of your hair. -Dad. You going my way? Got a present for you, pal. There you go. Dad. And this is for you, sawed-off. Thanks, Rocky. Well, so long, Rock. Take it easy, kids. Curly, there you go. Mr. and Mrs. Addams, you You cats are all right. Something fine and gracious has gone out of our lives. Right. Right. Right. Right. Darling? Are you sure that Zen-Yogi exercise is good for your mind? It really keeps you on your toes. Yes, I suppose it does. Anything interesting in the paper tonight, dear? Nothing much. A few riots, a few revolutions. Oh-ho. Says here that Rocky's joined his father's firm. I do hope the work doesn't throw him. Don't worry, querida mia. That's a boy with his feet firmly planted on the ground. Just like you, darling. A pleasant noise. What is it? That's what happens when you have a loose nut. 
Dear Pugsley. He does enjoy playing with his missiles. Keeps him out of mischief, too. It's amazing how that little rascal manages to keep one step ahead of the government space program. A true Addams. Ah, it's midnight. The perfect time for a little family picnic. We'll surprise the children. Oh, darling, they have to get up so early to go to school. Well, then we'll leave them here. That should certainly surprise them. Dear Gomez, so wise and understanding. That's exactly what they said about old Senator Addams just before they impeached him. Lurch, bring the car around back. Oh, you can't beat a night like this for a picnic. - And snail-hunting. - But where's Cousin Itt? - There you are, you little rascal. - So sweet of you to join us, Itt. Oh, but don't thank us. What would a snail-hunt be without you? You attract them. Isn't Mama coming? She's going to stay home with the children. Teaching them to make cobwebs. The games. Good work, Lurch. The family that plays together stays together. Put them in the trunk please, Lurch. - Can I turn on the radio? - By all means. I'll try to get music to go snail-hunting by. Dear Itt. It's his favorite music. Radio needs fixing. We interrupt this program for a special announcement. An unidentified space aircraft has been reported over the Cemetery Ridge area. Hey, that's our area. This is an unconfirmed report from MSO, Mysterious Space Objects Headquarters. There is no cause for alarm and residents of the area are urged not to panic. We now return you to Harpsichord Reverie. Hey, maybe they're Martians. Couldn't we stick around and find out? Well, then it's settled. We'll stay here and picnic right in our own backyard. Hinckley, MSO. You saw a flying object where? I see. Cemetery Ridge district. Near what house? The old Addams house? Well, thank you very much, we'll look into it. You know, that's the 14th call we've had on that Cemetery Ridge sighting. - What do you think? - Who knows? How about it, Professor? We are always sending spaceships up there. One of these days somebody up there is going to send something down here. You mark my words. The professor is no fool. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but he is dedicated. Spending 20 years of his life trying to figure out what the Martians probably talk like. You know, all this "ralamalabagata" talk may prove to be very valuable. If those little green guys ever do land, somebody's gonna have to palaver with them. I think we better get over to that Cemetery Ridge district and look around. Right. Oh, one more thing. This may prove to be another false alarm. But just in case it isn't, and you are captured, you know what you have to do. - Eat the codebook. - Roger. Tish, that French. You know what it does to me. - So lovely, so tasty. - You're just hungry, dear. Well, what's for supper? I could eat a horse. Come, come, Fester, you had that for lunch. Uncle Fester, be patient, we'll be dining soon. Why don't you go over and chat with Lurch and Cousin Itt? Oh, they're always talking politics. Darling, it's almost time for my moonbath. I'd take it easy, Morticia. Pretty strong moon. In fact, I'm gonna put on my moon hat. - Well, that's very becoming, Uncle Fester. - It's an original. Darling, would you fix my chair for me? Oh, thank you, darling. We ought to be able to get an excellent moonburn tonight. Gomez, darling, what would we do if a Martian did land right here? We'd do what any red-blooded American would do. Run. True. Gil. Take a look over there. Do you see what I see? I see it but I don't believe it. What do you think? I think it's time we get in touch with headquarters. - All right in there, querida? - Yes, darling. The moon was a bit strong. I thought I'd filter its rays. Oh, I wouldn't want you getting moonburn. - Darling, you look just like Galileo. - The astronomer? No, Cousin Galileo. He has a suit like that. Yes. Yes. Yes. Right. Earth and Mars are at their closest points tonight. What do you think they're up to? Whatever it is, I don't like it. Itt, you should speak English. Well, I guess you're right. It is a silly language. Now, let's see, Uranus transits Jupiter at exactly 12:32. Wonderful. Right on schedule. Punch is ready. - Punch? - A big punch. They're either getting ready to blow up the place or they're sending smoke signals. Smoke signals to whom? Who knows? To other spaceships. Maybe this is a rendezvous point. Well, the boss man said to move in and investigate. Yeah. Darling, are those men staring at us? Not us. At you. You're ravishing. - Darling, please, it's early. - Your watch is slow. Hey, they're coming over. They got such funny looks in their eyes. They could be people from Mars. Nonsense. They're not little, they're not green, and they don't have things sticking out of their heads. Itt's right. They could be disguised. Well, whoever they are, we must be neighborly. We don't want them thinking we Earth people are snobs. - Greetings. - Hi. We're from the MSO. I mean the USO. We do a lot of entertaining for the troops. You know, singing, dancing. Well, I'm glad you're Americans. - Where are you folks from? - Yonder. Uncle Fester, why don't you get our friends some punch? Coming up. I like to relax on these outings. - Do you gentlemen mind if I smoke? - Go right ahead. Punch? Didn't you ever see anybody smoke before? Everyone must be starved. - Uncle Fester, get the hotplate. - I got it right here. - Plug it in, dear, plug it in. - You ready, Fester? - Yeah, what is it, AC or DC? - AC. I do hope you gentlemen like tongue of yak. - Yak? - Nice and fresh. It costs a little more than the quick-frozen, but it's so much tastier. Would you people excuse us a minute? Yes, but hurry back, yak loses something when it's overdone. - Plenty strange behavior. - Yes. They didn't even touch Lurch's punch. Everything about us seems so strange to them. I think Cousin Itt is right. I believe they're from another planet. I agree. - You think it's possible? - I think. How do you like the way the little hairy one talked? - Do you figure that was Martian? - Not according to Professor Altshuler. Maybe he's a retarded Martian. Let's blow this clambake. No! One false move and who knows? We're slave labor on Mars. He's right again. One false move and who knows? We're slave labor on Mars. This is a delicate situation. We'd better play it by ear. Oh dear, I do wish Cousin Grope was here. He has three of them. Folks, we've decided to level with you. We're really not with the USO. I knew it. You didn't have any taps on your shoes. - We know exactly who you are, too. - We even speak your language. Our language? Gomez, dear, I think he's trying to tell you something. Well, agamagabagagawhographa to you. Excuse us. Those two fellows are up to something. - What are we going to do? - There's only one thing to do. Put them under lock and key. We want you come with us. - Oh, we couldn't do that. - We insist. Now look here We accept. How nice. I always say there's nothing like understanding between peoples. Quick, the codebook. - Oh, yeah, one of us has got to eat it. - Bon appétit. - Lurch, put the gentlemen in the love seat. - Yes, Mrs. Addams. You two gentlemen make yourselves comfortable, my wife and I have to feed some plants in the conservatory. - But, Gomez, dear - Querida. Oh, you may amuse yourselves with this. - That's little Pugsley's ray gun. - Ray gun? Watch. Dear Pugsley. He's so handy with these things. Have fun. On second thought, we don't want any mishaps, do we? I'll hang on to this. Well, at least we're still on Earth. Darling, aren't we being rude? After all, the plants don't need feeding. In fact, Cleopatra's on a diet. It's merely a ruse, my dear. We must engage in some counterintelligence. - See what their game is. - Oh, I do hope it's bridge. - What do you say we get out of here? - Yeah, we gotta get word to headquarters. We were just looking around. - See? Trapped. - Darling, that was truly inspirational. That's what they said about old Blood and Thunder Addams at Shiloh. - When he deserted? - Turned traitor. - How ghastly. - Not at those prices. Maybe we're just imagining all this. Maybe they're This is just their way of acting friendly. Maybe they're just a nice, odd It's all a question of strategic deployment of forces. Darling, you're a natural born leader. That's what they said about old Cannonball Addams at Bunker Hill. Right before he turned traitor? No, before he began firing at his own men. Poor old Canny, absolutely lost without his glasses. How about the window? Out! Gilbert, where are you? I don't know! Darling, I think we ought to call the authorities. Capital idea! Now let's see, whose jurisdiction would this come under? - CID? - No. COD? - USO? - MSO! Operator, get me the MSO. MSO Headquarters. I see. You have a couple of Martians in your basement. And how do you know they are Martians? Oh, they spoke Martian. And what did they say? This is the Martians speaking. Wait a minute, I'll be right there. Don't go away. You must Wait a minute, what is your name? Where do you live? Addams. Right next to the cemetery. It's a nice neighborhood. A nice neighborhood? What did I say? You Martian? Yes? Shalom. I come in peace. Wait here. - Operator. - Hello? Operator? MSO Headquarters. Emergency. Please hurry. Yes. It's QPA. The situation is worse than I thought. The Martians have taken over the whole house. Goodbye, Agnes. Isn't that wonderful? Just listen to the two of you chattering away. What in the world are you saying? I don't know about him, but I was bidding him welcome in Swahili. - You both speak English? - Well, of course we speak English. After all, we are in America, Professor Altshuler. Oh, yes, I know that, but How do you know my name? Why wouldn't we know it? We're the ones who called you. Stop beating around the bush. If you don't surrender, bluey! "Bluey"? Yeah, bluey. I will show you. Come and see here. Look. Mighty nice display, Altshuler. It's good to know the government is on the alert. Isn't that an awful lot of planes, though, just to arrest two little Martians in the basement? In the basement? Wait. Let me handle the whole thing. They may be violent. I don't know. We found them cooperative all the way. Come along. Well, old man, there's one of the rascals. - Darling, where did we put the other one? - Let me see. - Oh, yes. - Please be careful. - But they are not Martians! - Nonsense, they even speak Martian. - They learnt it from me! - Then you're Martian. - Funny, you don't look it. - Most certainly not. Oh, for heaven's sake, what's the matter with you? If they are not Martians and you are not Martians, what am I doing here? That's an interesting point. Why don't we all go outside and look around some more? No, no, no. I've had enough Martians for the whole day. Oh, my goodness. I forgot to call off the Plan X before we all get killed. Good thinking. - You can use this phone. - Yes. Hello? Operator? Yes, MSO Headquarters. Mach schnell, please. This is the silliest thing I've It's QPA. Listen what I'm going to say now. Cancel everything. I repeat, cancel everything. Yes, cancel Plan X, it's a false alarm! Why, this Addams bunch is the simplest, ordinary everyday family. Good man, Lurch. The whole thing seems to have been too much for him. Why, you space scientists. You're all so delicately balanced. Oh, gentlemen, excuse me. According to this, we'll be on Mars in another three years. Nonsense, Pugsley will be there long before that. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Oh, it's from the Air Force. Isn't that sweet? They are thanking us for our contribution to the nation's defense. Due to us, Plan X was fully tested. "From now on, there's no need for anyone to worry about a Martian invasion. "The nation is ready. " By george, I think one of Pugsley's missiles went out of control. No matter. Plan X will take care of everything. 
Now, now, Cleopatra, no gulping. Masticate, masticate. - Regular little glutton today. - She does love her giraffe burger. And that dinner music. Lurch! He's been stabbed! Nonsense, darling, that's the way he sings. He'd be better stabbed. - You know, I think Lurch has talent. - For dancing and juggling? No, for folk singing. They all sound like that on our TV. - Must be out of order. - No, I had the repairman check it. They're doing that on all the shows now. Singery, swingery, flingery. - What happened to all the doctors? - Well, they're singing, too. I do believe Lurch could become a recording star. By Jove, you may be right. I'll get the phone book, look up some record companies. - Lurch will be so surprised. - Lf they like him, so will I. Will you stop bothering me, Addams? I told you I'm not interested in making records of singing butlers. I only handle standard groups like The Polecats, The Zombies and The Headsplitters. Wait a minute. That voice. Is that him? Well, he does have a bit of a cold. Hang on. Gladys, dig this sound. Hey! That gets me. Bickle? Are you still there? Yes, I'm still here and I'll be right there. - Wild! - When he sings he's beautiful! He does have talent, doesn't he? I'm gonna make this guy the biggest thing in the music business. He's already the biggest thing in the butler business. Show him, Lurch. Stand up. Oh, he is a big one. And still growing. He'll sweep the country. Not so fast, Bickle. He hasn't swept the kitchen yet. Darling, country first, kitchen later. Grab your hat, boy, we're gonna go down to the studio and cut some records. Oh, no. I'm afraid dear Lurch is much too shy. You just forget about it, Lurch. - I'm sorry you came out here for nothing. - For nothing? Just a moment, my dear, this is the sort of thing Lurch needs. He's too inhibited. This will bring out his true personality. You see? The mere thought of it has him bubbling. Well, it's all settled, Bickle. You bring your recording equipment over after supper. You've got a deal. And you're gonna fracture 'em, pal. My, that sounds attractive. Mr. Bickle's almost finished, dear. Last time I was this nervous, you had twins. I never had twins, darling. - You didn't? - No. I must have been dreaming. Darling, you are nervous. Perhaps a little fencing will make you relax. Dear. - En garde. - Tish. That French. It goes right through me. They're through recording. Be right with you. - Darling, what are you doing? - Marking my place. This guy is dynamite. He'll be bigger than The Beagles. - The Beagles? - They're very tasty. Those are bagels. The Bagels? That's a great group, too. Well, gotta get going. Take care, Lurchy baby. My, isn't she the motherly one? - Your voice is beautiful, Lurch. - But I'd do a little work on my aim. Sorry. Watusi! You forgot the Freddy. Oh, my two favorite dances. The Freddy and the mazurka. - This is where he lives. - Real cool pad. Joan, Susie! - This is Lurch's place. - Oh, crazy! Such soothing music. That was the voice of Benny Bickle's hot new find, Lurch. And now Well, Lurch, with a talent like that, you ought to be a shoo-in as king of the butler's ball. Lurch, you go and practice, and that's an order. Hey, sounds like an accident. Great shades of Satan! A lynch mob! Nonsense. Lurch wasn't that bad. They're in an ugly mood. But I'm ready for them. Battle stations, everyone. Man the guns. Pass the ammunition. No, no, no, Gomez. It's not a lynch mob. Look, dear, it's Lurch's fans. Isn't that sweet? They really love you, Lurch. Work. Isn't he splendid? So devoted to his job. The perfect servant. Remind me to give him a raise. Better still, I'll buy one of his records. We want Lurch! We want Lurch! We want Lurch! We want Lurch! We want Lurch! Practice. All right, now. Eye on the ball. Darling, suppose I miss the ball and hit you? Counts as a stroke. Helps develop accuracy. Very clever. A hole in one! What a lovely sport. After lunch we'll try it blindfolded. Yes, it does make you work up an appetite, doesn't it? I'll ring for Lurch and have him fix lunch. Darling, what in the world could have happened to Lurch? That bell is a bit difficult to hear. We'd better go down to the kitchen. Observe the professional touch. By george, a club in one. Now, "Fillet of fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake. " Fillet of fenny snake. Fenny snake. We're always out of staples. Well, I guess I'll just have to use some chopped eel. Get away, Thing. Make your own lunch. Uncle Fester, have you seen - What are you doing? - I'm fixing my lunch, what else? A fine butler we've got. I rang and I rang but he didn't answer. I'm starving. That looks very tasty. It's a recipe I found in a book. Let's see. "Fillet of fenny snake in a cauldron boil and bake. "Eye of newt and toe of frog, "wool of bat and pollywog. " Stop, stop, you're making me hungry. Uncle Fester, this isn't a cookbook. That's the witches' scene from Macbeth. Hey, that Shakespeare was a real gourmet, wasn't he? Lurch should be fixing lunch. It isn't like him to neglect his duties like this. He hasn't answered anybody's ring for hours. - Maybe he just quit and walked out. - Oh, he wouldn't do that. Not without taking his references. Gomez, we'd better look for the poor dear and try and help him. Let's look in the playroom. While I was gabbing the whole thing's gone flat. - Oh, there you are. - Where have you been, Lurch? Playroom. Practicing. He didn't want to disturb us. Isn't that thoughtful? Well, it'd be more thoughtful if you practiced in the kitchen. But, darling, you're the one who told him to practice. Very well. Put the blame on me. My shoulders are broad. At least they are in this suit. Mr. Bickle says Lurch is breaking records. I prefer a butler who breaks dishes. Yes, Mr. Addams. We are faced with a very serious problem, and there is only one thing we can do. Worry. - Oh, dear, I'm glad to see you're relaxing. - Helps me worry. Have you caught anything? The last time you caught one of Mama's dress shoes. - This time I caught the other one. - Oh, that's good. She does look better in a matching pair. Oh, the mail's in. Thank you, Thing. I'm expecting an important letter from my banker, broker, taxman and barber. Barber? He's a wonderful banker, broker and taxman. - I'll take them, my dear. - Darling, they're all for Lurch. - Lurch? - Fan mail. Oh, these are for me. - Lurch? - Lurch. - Lurch? - Lurch. Well, no wonder there were none for me. The postman didn't have enough room. Come on, now. That Lurch charm. You know, this is for your fans. Now, let's see those pretty dimples. Perfect. I can't see a thing in here. Too dark. That's better. Now hold it. Perfect. Hey, that's a good one. Came out nice and clear. Only I don't think I captured the real you. It's the real me. I wonder what happened. Great jumping catfish! Consolidated Fuzz is down to three. Oh, these pictures of Lurch are lovely. Consolidated Fuzz has dropped from 278 to three and all you can talk about is Lurch? I'm glad I don't own any Consolidated Fuzz. - Lurch, the door. - Lurch is busy resting. That's ridiculous! How can he expect to rest with me yelling for him every five minutes? I'll handle the door. But someone else will have to take care of the cleaning and the washing. Lurch! We wanna see Lurch! - We gotta get his autograph! - I'm sorry, but Lurch is not Here. - What happened? - Lurch is very big with fainters. I'll go get some smelling salts. Hurry up, I really need some. There are no two ways about it. Lurch's career is costing us a fortune in smelling salts. His fans are rather delicate. Frankly, Morticia, I'm sorry you ever pushed him into making those records. I ever pushed him into making records! Who was it called Mizzy Bickle in the first place? - You. - Oh, yes. But who was it insisted they bring over the recording equipment? Who was it insisted Lurch sing? Who was it ordered him to practice? That was me, too, wasn't it? Well, since I'm the one who got us into this mess, I'm going to let you get us out. You tell Lurch he has to choose between crooning and butling. Oh, darling, I couldn't do that to dear Lurch. You're the head of the family, Gomez, you tell him. Am I supposed to do everything? We'll do this the democratic way. We'll vote on it. Capital idea! All those in favor of allowing Gomez to tell Lurch will say "Aye. " - Aye. - Aye. Aye. It's unanimous. But, I, I, I Three more ayes. It's becoming a landslide. Addams here. Oh, yes, Bickle. Tell Lurch what? Really? That's a great idea, Bickle. Splendid. Cara mia! Our troubles are over. We don't have to tell Lurch anything. - He's leaving on a world tour. - Leaving? He's going to London, Paris, Brooklyn. You rang? Oh, excuse me, I wasn't expecting you. Just passing by. Mr. Bickle's going to take you on a tour of the world. The The world? Oh, come, come, Lurch. You can show a little more enthusiasm than that. No. Voice gone! Oh, the poor dear, the excitement must be too much for him. He's really speechless. Quickly, down to the playroom. We must restore his voice. Don't worry, Dr. Addams only lost one patient. His first and his last. Gomez, darling, I have an idea. If he can't talk, he can't sing. That solves everything. - You're right. - No, I'm not. It must be a free choice. Lurch must make his own choice between singing and butling. All right, Lurch, say, "Ah. " Oh, that's right, I forgot. You can't talk. Querida, you'd better take a look at this. - See anything? - Nothing except a stick. - Spray. - Spray. Spray. It's no good, Fester, it didn't help a bit. That's funny. It cured the rose bushes just like that. Uncle Fester, I don't believe Lurch has aphids. No, nor scarabs, either, otherwise I would have seen them. Lurch, try some of my old-fashioned remedy. Don't spill it on the table, it takes the paint right off. Now. There, now, isn't that better? Can you sing now? I just got to pinpoint this trouble. Pinpoint? Why didn't you say so? - Mama, what did you do? - I pinpointed the trouble. By george, I was right. He's regained his voice. Here he comes. I won't go. But, Lurch, dear, the world is waiting for you. Your fans are out there drooling. Yeah, and walking all over Morticia's thorns. Don't worry about us. Uncle Fester will pinch-hit until we find someone else. Well, I better get down to the kitchen and prepare supper. If anybody wants anything, just ring. Oh, isn't that sweet? An autographed picture. Best picture you ever took, Lurch. Doesn't look a thing like you. Goodbye, Lurch. Good luck. Bye. Well, he belongs to the ages now. I'll miss his happy, smiling face. I need a drink. I'll ring for Fester. You rang? Lurch! You're back! To stay. There's nothing like the sound of happy voices raised in song. They are much happier now, aren't they, darling? Now that Lurch is home to stay. Darling, why isn't Lurch singing? He has a perfectly lovely voice. There are a few more fans hanging around outside. We didn't want to take any chances. Darling, you think of everything. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family That Uncle Tom 's Cabin sure packs a wallop. They say Latin is a dead language. Thank you, culture lovers. Oh, hello, darlings. You just missed your father's Latin hour. How was school today? Back to reality, eh, children, from a world of fantasy? Wednesday, Pugsley? What's the matter, children? Oh, I know, you got A's again. Worse. That cranky old principal scolded us for having fun at recess. Recess? If I remember correctly, I flunked that three times. Tough. But why on earth would the principal scold you? Search us. We were just showing the kids how to shoot dynamite caps. Well, it seems harmless enough. At least they weren't frittering away their time with marbles. But he got real mad when one of the kids blew up the teeter-totter. He didn't follow my instructions, and the principal said if we ever played with dynamite again, he'd expel us. Expel you? He can't do that. Can he? After all, darling, he is the principal. You children run along now and play. Gomez, if that principal denies our children normal self-expression, they're liable to become frustrated and warped. You're right. We don't want them bitter and suspicious of their fellow men. I think we ought to transfer them to another school. Those public schools, they're all the same. No, no, no, I mean a private school. Darling, do you remember Mr. Hilliard? Hilliard? Hilliard. Oh, the fellow who used to be the truant officer. The very one. I've heard he's running a marvelous private school called Mockridge Hall. That's it then. Mockridge Hall. I'll ring up Hilliard right away. As old Erasmus Addams once said, "You've got to take the bull by the teeth. " Teeth? Some people here to see you. If there are more bill collectors, I'm out. Our bank account is absolutely Oh, they said their name was Addams. - Addams? One "D" or two? - They didn't say. - Did they seem a little - Quite a little. Miss Ames, I just remembered a dental appointment, and I can hardly wait to get there. Mr. Hilliard, what a charming surprise! You see, Gomez, it is our old friend. Hilliard, old bean, you just sort of dropped out of sight. Yeah, I certainly tried. You're the only truant officer our children ever missed. We wondered if you were still with the public school system? No, no, that didn't work out, thanks to you. Our pleasure, old man, and a shrewd move on your part, too. You do remember our remarkable offspring? Pugsley and Wednesday. Names that haunt even my happiest hours. Mr. Hilliard, what a lovely compliment! In that case, Hilliard, you'll be more than delighted to know that we are again placing them in your capable hands. Oh, no. We want to enroll them in Mockridge Hall immediately. The public school system is stifling their creative talents. I can imagine. Well, that's that. Come, my dear, we'll fetch our offspring at once. Just a moment. I'm afraid there's a slight complication. Yes, the tuition. No problem at all. You name it. No, it isn't that. You see, we have a very limited enrolment. And at the moment, there are absolutely no openings. Well, you see, we have just so many desks. As a matter of fact, I had to turn down somebody this morning. Oh, but, Mr. Hilliard, there must be some way. No way. No way at all, Mrs. Addams. I'm sorry, but there's absolutely no possibility of You see, we have just so many desks. Well, there's your answer. Two more desks, no problem. Will $10,000 cover it? As you can see, my husband has the ability to solve the most insurmountable problems. Come on, my pet, we'll find the children at once. Gomez, look. I had no idea Mr. Hilliard was such a sentimentalist. Weeping for joy. You, too? Every school loves a military touch. We just had to show our appreciation by giving this school this cannon. But why does it have to be my cannon? How can I face that empty room tonight? Uncle Fester, it's for the children. Well, in that case, you better let me sight it in, in case they decide to use it. In case they decide to use it? Fester, this cannon will be an absolute must at jousting, regattas, polo and curling events. I would estimate a five-knot breeze from the direction of the glue factory. The glue factory? That's dinner. Yes. Good shot, Fester. Too bad the chief lost his fighting spirit when Geronimo quit. Children, home from dear old Mockridge Hall so soon? They let Pugsley and me come home in the middle of our first class. I'll wager the pets were a smash hit. When my octopus gave the teacher a hug, she got so flustered she rang the fire alarm. Dear Aristotle, he's such an affectionate creature. Sometimes I worry about the way he takes up with total strangers. And did teacher like your Gila monster? She got so thrilled that she called for Mr. Hilliard to come and see it, and then she got so excited that she fainted. Anyone who likes animals that much has got it here. Next pet day you should take Mama's alligator. - Do you think she'll let us? - Well, why don't you ask her? She's downstairs in the basement wrestling with him now. I nearly forgot. Mr. Hilliard sent you a note. A personal note from Mr. Hilliard. Isn't that thoughtful? Man's a pure thoroughbred, Tish. Thank you, Thing. Smartest thing we ever did, enroll the children at Mockridge Hall. Gomez, darling, I don't understand this. I think it's some sort of joke. Oh, Hilliard, he's a laugh a minute. What is it this time? Well, he says the children are permanently expelled. He even suggests a psychiatrist. "No amount of money in this world is sufficient. " Morticia, this man sounds irrational. He does need a psychiatrist. I'll call him right now and get things squared away. Darling, don't you think I'd better call? You're apt to be a bit excited. You're right, my dear. Where the welfare of my children is concerned, I'm a snarling wolf at bay. Oh, thank you, Thing. Hello? May I speak with Mr. Hilliard, please? Mrs. Addams calling. What did he say? I'm afraid you're right, dear. The poor man is irrational. - I could hardly understand him. - Did you get the gist of it? Well, he babbled something about Board of Regents and the faculty. He said the children would be a menace in any school. Poor devil, he's not responsible. Being pressured by higher-ups. I'm afraid you're right. But what do we do about the children? What about their schooling? Morticia, there are some things that money just won't buy. And some things it will. Mockridge Hall, for instance. Crackling good notion. We'll buy the place, run it as it should be run, and take the pressure off of Hilliard. Oh, I wish I could be there when that wonderful man hears the good news. You will, you will, my dear. It will be another glorious chapter in Addams history. A new institution of higher learning is born. Darling, how did you ever happen to think of such an original name? Just came to me. Darling, why don't you relax? You must be utterly exhausted. The chancellor of Addams Hall has little time for creature comforts, my dear. Remember, tempus fungus. That, too. Gomez! I consider it an honor to serve under you as dean of demolition and dynamite. - You're the perfect man for it, Fester. - You could get electronics. Oh, sure. It must be Mr. Hilliard. Straight faces, everyone. Remember, save the surprise until last. Mr. Hilliard. - Hey, old man, come in, come in. - What a pleasant surprise. For some obscure reason, the Board of Regents ordered me to stop by here. Board of Regents, eh? They do push you around a lot, don't they? They must be a constant thorn in your side. Oh, our relationship is most cordial, and we quite concur on the matter of your children, if that's the reason Brave try, old man, but there's no need to cover up for them any longer. They're off your back for good. What are you driving at? You will be delighted to know that there's an entirely new Board of Regents. Pardon? You don't possibly mean that you Right as rain. We have purchased Mockridge Hall. Lock, stock and you. Me? Me! We insist you remain as headmaster. We feel sure you'll fit in perfectly with the new plans we have. Plans? Yeah, I've given my department a lot of thought. - Your department? - Exactly. With the exception of the headmaster, you, we have replaced the entire faculty. Hilliard, old man, come here. We've assembled the most advanced teaching aids in the country. Look at this. Visual aids make strong impressions on young minds. - Professor Fester, will you oblige? - I'll be glad to. However, visual combined with audio really are truly effective. Observe. Watch. In a right isosceles triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the opposite two sides. This is a recording. What child could resist that? Look, Mrs. Addams And, Hilliard, you'll be pleased to hear that we're de-emphasizing all of the snap courses like English, Science, Mathematics Pugsley, when he was born, was already up to calculus. Wednesday recited The Raven her first day. Now, we're going back to the real fundamentals. Advanced head shrinking. Yes, that ought to be a required course. And a crash course in theoretical taxidermy. Yes, and freshman dynamite one and two. I'll be teaching that, of course. I wouldn't dare trust it to anyone else. Oh, this is insanity! And Mama has got some marvelous ideas for the home economics class. You rang? Yes, Lurch. Would you mind bringing Mama's contribution to the home economics class? Thank you. Show it to Mr. Hilliard. - Baked mongoose. - No, thank you, I just ate. Save it for later, Lurch. Don't tell me that's part of the faculty, too. Thing is our new attendance monitor. Mr. And Mrs. Addams, it's simply incredible that you'd expect a man of my scholastic reputation to turn the curriculum of Mockridge Hall into complete bedlam. - Addams Hall, Mr. Hilliard. - We have complete confidence in you. Cousin Itt, are you going to teach animal husbandry? Of course. Why didn't I think of that? Raising our own sheepskin for our diplomas. You can see how shrewd and practical we're gonna be. Mr. Hilliard, isn't it exciting? With our innovations and your experience, Addams Hall will be famous in no time. There's no doubt about that. Well, now that we understand each other, have you any suggestions, Hilliard, old man? Yes, yes, I do have a suggestion. I suggest you get a new headmaster, I I'm leaving. I retire. I quit. Goodbye! Goodbye! Who could've guessed at his mental state? Poor devil. Probably felt inadequate to the challenge. Thunderation! Where can we find a replacement? I'll give it a whirl. We may have to go to the ends of the earth to find a man with the suitable wit, intuition and wisdom for the position. We don't even have to leave this room. Look, dear. Querida, you are indeed the wise one. It's destiny. Kismet. You owe it to the youth of America. You must assume the mantle. Our school much prefers challenging your school to a jousting tournament. But since jousting is not in your restricted curriculum, we accept your offer of polo. Respectfully, etcetera, etcetera. Beautiful shot, darling. Good show, old paint. Same time tomorrow. Darling, I'll get that letter off with the others in a moment. Querida, how can I bear this heavy burden without you at my side? Darling, such rewarding work. In only two short weeks absenteeism has completely disappeared. All a question of intelligent presentation of subject matter. Dear Uncle Fester, he just loves giving those finals. Cousin Itt. And how is our professor of speech therapy? How nice. You've been working with the porpoises today? You have a progress report on tape? Well, let's hear it. That's incredible. His lisp is completely gone. Soon the porpoise will take over the class, and you can go back as instructor at the barber college. Dear Cousin Itt, he fits in so perfectly. He's all Addams. Oh, dear, that must be the committee from the mothers' club. They called earlier. - Bully! Show them in. - Yes, darling. Tish, you know what that French does to me. Chancellor Addams, really! Sorry, wrong arm. I'm Mrs. Addams. Welcome, gentle mothers, at your service. We have come to verify the fantastic things our children have been telling us. Classes in mine laying and do-it-yourself dentistry? Would you like to tour the campus? Thank you, but I think we've seen quite enough. Mr. Addams, in this envelope is a resolution signed by the parent of every child in this school, except yours. What an honor after such a short time in office. Oh, I do hope it's suitable for framing. It states that unless Mr. Hilliard and his programs are reinstated, every child in this school will be withdrawn at once. And we do mean at once. Mr. Hilliard, or an empty school. Come, ladies. Such dear, compassionate ladies. Dear? Compassionate? Even though they're wrong, they can't bring themselves to let Mr. Hilliard down. - It's blind loyalty. - Lf I could only be certain. Darling, why don't we go home? In the proper surroundings, you'll see things in their true perspective. Lurch should be back by now. Slow. What's the correct time, pet? Thank you, my dear. It's a noble thing you're about to do, Gomez. Confronted with your relentless logic, my dear, I have no choice. Oh, Mr. Hilliard, how nice of you to drop by. Drop by? I was brutally kidnapped by that one-man goon squad. Same old Hilliard. He can charm the birds out of the trees. Mr. Hilliard, we have such lovely news for you. You mean I can go? No, no, no. Not until you have some refreshment. Why does it have to be me? Always me. - Here you are. - No. We like the cut of your jib, Hilliard. We need you back at the school. I'll take that after all, Mrs. Addams. Your presence at the school is an absolute must, Mr. Hilliard. Why can't I make you understand that wild horses wouldn't drag me And the fierce, if somewhat blind, loyalty of our mothers should not go unrewarded. And feast your eyes on this, old sport. The new financial report. Why, the school is financially independent forever. I simply don't understand. Now that my husband has brought the school out of its scholastic doldrums as well, we feel confident that you will follow the trail he's blazed. If I did return, I'd have to be in complete charge. - Oh, I'd insist on that. - Then it's agreed. Wait a minute, let's understand each other. - I'm to run the school as I see fit? - Exactly. No catches. Well, we'll be honest with you. There is one. I knew it. Fester stays on as dean of demolition. I knew it, I knew it! - Wait, wait till I get to the catch. - There's more? You see, he's working on a rather complicated project here at home. It may be years before you can actually have him. I think I can make the sacrifice. Good news, Uncle Fester. Mr. Hilliard's coming back to school. Well, the way things are going, I'll need an extended leave. Problems with the project? Yeah. I got the whole formula backwards. It's supposed to blow up, not down. Mr. Hilliard, it's too bad you can't have him sooner. He's such a perfectionist. If only the music appreciation class could have heard that. Off to school, children? Well, give our best to Mr. Hilliard. Father, we don't like private school anymore. It's no fun now that you're not there. That's a point. We want to go back to public school. Very well, on one condition. That you keep up your home studies with Uncle Fester and Grandmama. We'll keep up our home studies. We promise. Wait until the principal sees us again. Come on, Pugsley. Oh, boy. I can hardly wait to see his face. It turns such a pretty purple. Bye, children. Oh, dear. Back to public school again, after all that trouble. But it served a purpose, Morticia. Education's in my blood. I can't quit. - What do you mean, darling? - It's a surprise, my dear, a surprise. Thank you, Thing. Hello, Watkins? How's the deal? Oh, Harvard wouldn't sell? Well, too bad. I wanted to get it for Mrs. Addams' birthday. Well, keep trying old man. Try Oxford, Yale, Princeton. Gomez, how touching, darling! You wanted to buy me Harvard for my birthday. Come to think of it, it is rather a silly gift for a beautiful woman. I should get you Vassar. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Oh, darling, are you sure I'm ready for this? Querida, I've taught you all my mastery of the bullwhip. Surely, flicking the ash off a cigar should be child's play. Very well, darling, if you say so. Where's Mama? I want her to see this. Did somebody call me? Mama, why the suit of armor? No offense, Morticia, but I feel more secure wearing this ever since Gomez told me that a bullwhip can slice a man's head off like that! Oh, I'm sure he was exaggerating, but suit yourself. Are you ready, Gomez? Ready, my dear. Remember, aim, close your eyes and fire away. Mama, speak to me. Can you hear me? Certainly. There's no need to shout. Lucky thing I remembered to duck. Mail's in. I do believe Thing is trying to tell us something. Of course, it's a letter from Spain. Gracias, Thing. Oh, darling, it's for you. You open it, my dear. Maybe it's a bill. Oh, you're so thoughtful. I better give this a rub down before it stiffens up. That's interesting, it's from Pamplona. Pamplona? I knew it. Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas. Who are they? They? Him. Back in the old country, our families were as close as Siamese twins. How cozy. Oh, well, he says he's arriving here all the way from Spain tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning. Oh, good heavens! Gomez! Wait, why don't we surprise Gomez? You little imp. That's what everyone called me in my sorority. Oh, it says here that he's coming for his daughter Consuella's wedding. Weddings are such fun. Yes, especially when everyone cries. Gomez! You big boy now. Last time I see you, you so little. - I'm Lurch. - A church? - Lurch. - Oh, Lurch. The butler. I see. I Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas. Follow me. Oh, Consuella, I am so happy we have wait for you to marry Gomez. It is your wish even though I do not know Senor Addams. Only Senor Gomez Addams is good enough for marry Molinas. That is why his grandpapa and I signed marriage contract when you are little girl. - Don Xavier! - Gomez! Oh, this must be Consuella. My, what a big girl you are! Gomez, that is the duena. How do you say? The chaperone. This is my Consuella. But of course. I haven't seen you since I was five, but I remember how we used to play casa. This is Morticia. Morticia, this is Don Xavier Molinas, duena and Consuella. How you do? How do you do? Querida, this is my hermana. My sister, you might say. - What did he say? - He say she his sister. Oh, his sister! Sí. Did you ever think I'd marry such a beautiful woman? - Oh, Senor. - Oh, but I knew you would. And you have waste no time. This must be the padre, no? Padre, no. That's Uncle Fester. He went south with his polo team. And they're winning, too. Don Xavier, Consuella, la duena. You remember Mama? I'll see about your rooms, ladies. You rang? Yes, Lurch, would you please help with the luggage? Yes, Mrs. Addams. That's the day you fought two bulls, back to back. But it was nothing, I Thank you, Thing. In America, the servants are cheap. To the Molinas. To you and your lovely daughter, Consuella. To you and your sister, Morticia. No, Don Xavier, Morticia's not my sister, she's my wife. Life? Oh, sí. You lead a wonderful life. - Consuella will be happy with such a man. - Thank you. I hope she finds one. Has Gomez changed much since he was a little boy? Oh, he so little, me so little. Only remember we play casa. - You played what? - Casa. House. Oh? Now Gomez and I get married, you and I real sister. What's she mean by that? Well, I'm sure she means In Spain, Gomez is a very common name. She probably means she's going to marry someone by that name. No, me marry Gomez, you brother. - My brother? - Sí. - Who? - He. - My Gomez? - My Gomez. You know, Don Xavier, I have a vast network of offices all over the world. My girl in Madrid did nothing but try to locate you. And then there's my girl in Barcelona, and of course my girl in Toledo and then I have two girls in Sevilla and then there's good old Sadie in Lisbon. Do you hear what I hear? I'm counting. So many girls. Can you not get rid of a few? I'd be lost without them. - The wife is always the last to know. - Oh, dear. Now, about the dowry The hand of Consuella should be enough for the lucky groom. It is a matter of honor. I do not have dollars, but perhaps you will hold this for me. "I owe you one million pesetas. " Well, let's see, that's Thank you, Thing. One million pesetas is 16,600 potatoes. - I'd better keep this in a safe place. - You will accept it, then? I shall guard it with my life. - Wife? - Life. Let me show you Morticia's beautiful African strangler. - That Bluebeard. - He should be boiled in oil. No, he enjoys that too much. Besides, we must think of the children. - Why don't you think of yourself? - Oh, it's too late for me. But we can still save Consuella. She can't be just another cipher, another number in his harem. My son with a harem. I didn't know he had it in him. Cousin Itt? It's me, Morticia. Good afternoon. Cousin Itt, I'm in such a terrible dilemma. Gomez is being untrue, but I don't want to get him into trouble. What should I do? Have my head examined? But I still love him and he wants to marry Consuella. Have his head examined? You may have something, there. There must be something wrong with him. He has girls all over the world. I'm sure he could get one for you, but that doesn't solve my problem. I'm sure it would solve yours. Oh, Cousin Itt, I thought you were going to be so helpful. Haven't you ever been in love? What was she like? A tall, beautiful blonde? And brunette? Well, that's silly of you to break up. Some of my best friends have two heads. What shall I do about Gomez? Excellent idea. I'll scare him. How? No, Cousin Itt, I think this calls for a bit more subtlety. No. No, nothing physical. It should be psychological. That's it! I'll use psychology. Thank you, Cousin Itt and To you. By george, there's nothing like a pogo stick for getting around the house. I think I'll get one for Mama. Mama prefers a skateboard. Mama and her dignity. Gomez, do you know what the penalty is for bigamy? Of course, two wives. That's an old joke. That's an old law book. - I swapped with Mama for my pogo stick. - How nice. The family that swaps together, hops together. - Shakespeare? - Uncle Fester. Oh, good old Fester. He'd be quite a philosopher if he weren't such a bubblehead. - How do you like my painting? - Querida, it's marvelous. What is it? - Interesting. - Do you recognize the face? I'd recognize that face with my eyes shut. Cousin Crimp. Gomez, it's you. By george, there is a resemblance. Doesn't it send chills up your spine? Gives me goose bumps. I've got the perfect name for it, too. - What? - Joy. I think that this is more practical. Egad, that's disturbing news. - It is? - Certainly is. "Weatherman predicts sunny skies for entire week. " Don't you notice anything else? How can I miss? Stock market's down four points. You didn't see anything about a jealous wife shooting her husband? I never read the sports page. It's right there. Oh, yes. "Jealous wife shoots husband. " Very messy. Yes, isn't it? Poison is so much easier on the carpets. She's probably a very sloppy housekeeper. And a spoilsport. As the man voted by my law class as most likely never to pass the bar, I predict that this woman will soon learn she can't go around shooting people, not without a permit. Oh, it's no use, Cousin Itt. Psychology didn't work at all. No, no, definitely no shooting. Why? Because I have no permit. No, no, that would absolutely ruin the carpets. No, poison doesn't agree with him. Pin a medal on him? Certainly not. I know. I can't help it. I am a soft-hearted Oh, thank you, Thing. Thing, I'm going to take definite action. I'm going to put a stop to this, no matter what the consequences to Gomez. I can't. I love him too much. Did you know that Cousin Itt said that I was a I'm a double Et tu, Thing? Oh, that must be Senor Cardona, the flamenco dancer. I thought a little entertainment would make our guests feel at home. Who knows? This may become their home. Don't worry, my dear, I have a way of getting rid of people - who begin to pall on me. - That's what I'm afraid of. Senor Cardona. Senor Cardona. Senor, we have a wonderful surprise for you. I shall accompany you on the guitar. How kind. Thank you, Thing. Much better. I hear guitar. Oh, Consuella, darling, come in. Consuella Molinas, this is Senor Cardona. What a beautiful thing. It's just a little something I composed myself. I mean the guitar. May I? Do you play? Well, not so good like Senor Gomez, but I try. - Exquisite. - Not bad for a beginner. You play, I stay. She no play, I no stay. She play, you stay. - Okay? - Olé! Excuse me, Querida. Wine, please. Thank you, Thing. Nothing like instant wine. - Lovely evening, cara mia. - Lovely. To love. A bit sweet. Think I'll switch to champagne. I must be alone with you. No, no, I am promised to Gomez. My padre kill me, kill you, kill everybody. You know, I think I better announce the betrothal of Gomez and Consuella tonight, - right away. - Excuse me. You're very handy. Morticia, Don Xavier is about to announce Gomez' engagement. Gomez will be forced to deny it and then Don Xavier will kill him. Oh, we can't let that happen. Gomez is much too young to die. He looks a lot younger than he is. Amigos, attention. I would like to make a toast to my future son-in-law. I'll drink to that. My future son-in-law But first a toast to our friends from Spain. - I'll drink to that. - You are most gracious. - But I would like to make a toast to - To Consuella, a lovely flower blooming in her prime. I'll drink to that. Por favor, I want to drink to A toast to Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas. A real cutie pie. I'll drink to that. Senora, you are most kind, but what about I'd like to propose a toast To my future son-in-law, Gomez Addams. I'll drink to that. - A little joke. - It is no joke. - No joke? - You are engaged since you were five. You proposed when you were five years old? I must have been a wild one. No propose. Marriage contract signed in blood by Addams grandpapa and me. But I'm already married to Morticia. - You are married to your sister? - Sister? - Sí. - Who? - He. - Me? I am not his sister. We're husband and wife. Husband and wife? You make insult. - Who? - He. - Me? - Sí. Gee. Pistols at ten paces. But, Don Xavier, you're the best shot in all of Spain. You're the best shot in all of Spain. That's why I do not say swords. No. I will not have bloodshed in this room. I guess we'll just have to shoot around her. It's easy. I expect this kind of dishonor. Fire away. Querido mío, what have they done to you? Oh, isn't that sweet? They're in love. - Who? - He. - She? - Sí! Don Xavier, I think you're going to need this IOU. Not me, he. I am sorry, Don Xavier, I do not accept IOUs. Senor, the IOU of Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas is as good as his check post-dated. Now, now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen, let's not quibble. Mr. Addams and I have decided to give the young couple a gift in exactly the amount of the IOU. Cardona, you'll have my IOU in the morning. - In cash, dear. - Cash it is. Easy come, easy go. - Senor Addams, you are true Bluebeard. - Blueblood. - Who? - He. - Me? - Sí! Oh, darling, wasn't it exciting last night? Not half as exciting as this morning. United Cannonball is rising fast and I neglected to buy a single share. Well, it's just as well. What would we do with all those cannonballs around the house? Well, the children are happy at any rate. Yes. Just listen to them playing at their little games. Sorry, Mama, I didn't know you were in there. You think the children perhaps are overdoing it a bit, my dear? Nonsense, darling. After all, you're only young once. Yes. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Concentrate. Concentrate. Are you concentrating? Assiduously, my dear. Gomez, if you can hear me, you are not concentrating. Oh, sorry. I suppose Madame Curie had days like this, too. Let's get on with it. Get your notebook, Uncle Fester. Goody! Ready. At exactly 10:28, subject's body stiff as a board. Subject stiff as a board. Indicating complete mental control. Control. Entered final phase of Addams experiment to prove that the human mind can triumph over the law of gravity. Gravity. Positions, please. Now remember, we must pull together. Watch for the signal. Now! That gravity's a tough one. Darling, are you positive you were concentrating? Certainly. Did it work? Not quite. You were doing fine until you hit the floor. Hey, that's easy. We could just lower the floor. I think Fester's got something there. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Oh, it's for you, darling. I wonder what that is? My new mark seven, custom-built, grand prix croquet mallet. I stole it for $200. Thank you, Thing. Occupant. Occupant. Occupant. Occupant. So nice to be remembered. Oh, Uncle Fester. Here's one for you, dear. It's from her. Diana Delf. Uncle Fester, what's come over you? She sent it to me, personally. I've been writing to her for months. Ever since I saw her in the show. Just a moment, you'd better let me do it. You'll tear it. - Oh, it's a picture! - Oh, me first. It's her! It's her! Let me see, Uncle Fester, let me see. Oh, by george, she's a dazzler. Boy, I gotta get right upstairs and write her an answer. Oh, my Diana! He's Addams all the way. Can't resist a pretty face. Now, if you'll observe, my dear, croquet is a combination of two things. Balance, timing, peripheral vision, superb coordination and a killer's instinct. - Your shot, my dear. - Oh. Gomez, I'm worried. Querida, you've forgotten everything I've taught you. Sorry, darling. Congratulate me, everybody. Congratulations! That is wonderful. What happened? I'm gonna get married. I just proposed to the sweetest little girl in the entire world. Oh, well, that's very sweet, Uncle Fester. But can you support a wife? Oh, details, details. Gomez, can you see your way clear to advance me a nickel for a postage stamp? No, but I can give you a check. Oh, well, while you're making it out, make it for, say, even 10,000. - For stamps? - Well, no, you know, incidentals like the minister, the marriage license, rice, - attorney. - Attorney? - I may get divorced. - Divorced? You know, be prepared. I remember that from when I was a scout. There must be something wrong with this carpet. Well, where's the checkbook? - Oh, I'll get it. - Uncle Fester, just a moment. You've never even met this girl. You run a great risk of ruining your life and hers, as well. Good thinking, my dear. Then I don't get the check? Maybe next time. Oh, okay. I'll send it COD. Oh, Gomez, it's breaking my heart. Mine, too. This mallet isn't worth a plugged nickel. Darling, I was referring to Uncle Fester and that girl. Oh. Oh, yes. Well, I suppose her parents must be as upset as we are. - I'm sure they would be, if they were here. - But they're not. But they could be. At least, her mother could be. And she doesn't even have to make the trip. Querida, I do believe you're up to some mischief. Yes. What do you think? Do you think I'll fool Uncle Fester? - You can fool me. - Oh, mon cher. But not when you speak French. Darling, please, my make-up. Yes, make-up. Nothing wrong with that mallet. Diana's mama. Mother! Just looking at you makes me feel like I've known you for a long time. Too long. Say, where's what's her name, your daughter? Just a minute. I've got a few questions to ask you. Sit down. How much money have you got? Well, that's hard to say. What's your salary? That's hard to say, too. I'll give you something easy to say. What do you do? I hang around. I help my nephew play with the trains and I shoot off the cannon. And I clean out the alligator's nest. I sit in my tree, you know. I know. You're one of those stage-door johnnies. Mother, you're acting very suspicious. I got a little suspicious when I had to pay five cents postage due on your proposal to my daughter. You owe me a nickel. You need it all at once? For what? 'Cause I'm kind of strapped right now. Forget it! Just forget the whole thing. And forget my daughter, too. She's gonna marry a man that can support her. All right! All right, if that's what it takes. I'll get her, you'll see. I'll be a big success. I'll throw gold and diamonds right at your daughter's feet. I warn you, she's got very big feet. "Prospectors, send $1 for guaranteed treasure map. "Raise mink in your own home. " No, that's no good. "We can release the hidden power within you. "Let us set your feet on the road to fame and fortune. "Complete correspondence course from the Greer Business College. " That's it! Sweetheart, you'll be proud of me yet. I'll throw diamonds and rubies at your big feet. Now that you've completed your entire course, you may consider yourself a graduate of the Greer Business College of Correspondence. A few weeks ago, you entered this institution a slack- jawed, glassy-eyed jellyfish. But today, by following our teaching, you have unlocked your potential, transformed yourself into dynamic, hard-hitting executive material. You've already chosen your first target. Hit it hard. Now, the world is your oyster. Goody! I like oysters. You have a date with destiny. Fester Gomez, this is the most beautiful moment of my whole life. I can't wait for my first class reunion. Now, Fester, this job nonsense has gone far enough. Oh, careful there, Gomez. You're talking to a dynamic, hard-hitting executive. - Really, Fester - Sir to you. And look at you. Just look at yourself. Take inventory. That ridiculous suit. Those preposterous high-button shoes. No class. No style. No appeal. Things that I have always had. Really, Fester, I Now, look, I'll do the thinking around here and do you know why? Because I used to be a slack-jawed, glassy-eyed jellyfish, just like you. But I unlocked my potential. I became a new man. Hey, Gomez, I may even change my name. - Fester, what - I'm sorry, I'm very busy. Busy doing what? Well, I'll think of something. Good day, sir. - Well? - It's worse than we thought. - What did he say? - He said my shoes were preposterous. Well, they do need polishing. That I was a glassy-eyed, slacked-jawed jellyfish. I better think up an answer to that. I hear it fairly often. That's nonsense. I'm going to demand an apology. There you are. Uncle Fester, I think you and I had better have a talk. Oh, sorry, a big day. First stop, Thaddeus P. Logan. Big business tycoon. - Do you have an appointment with him? - No, but I think I can sandwich him in. Uncle Fester, wouldn't you rather sit up in your tree house? - My tree house. - It's more you. That's true. But I owe it to my beautiful Diana to be a big wheel. And I am. It said so on the record. Uncle Fester, how would you like a nice new cannon? - A new cannon? - Come with me. Right over here. Tish, that's French. Darling, please. Let's concentrate on Uncle Fester's problem. Oh, yes. Yes, Uncle Fester's problem. But I'm next. Fester, give up all this big business nonsense and the cannon is yours. You make it very difficult for me, Gomez. I love Diana. I dream of running barefoot through her beard. Fester, you mean you'd give all this up for a woman? That's kid's stuff. You rang? No, but, Lurch, you can get the car out. I have a date with a very important oyster. Well, I tell you, J. D. , I'll let you have the whole 20,000 shares at $50 a share. You'll pay $25? What are you trying to do, J. D. , ruin me? Those shares are worth 50 if they're worth a penny. It's 50 or nothing. - What the - Play it cool, he'll call back. Who the devil are you? Let's face it, J. D. , you need a man like me. I'm magnetic. I'm hard-hitting! Hello. J. D? You will pay 50? It's a deal. Will you have a cigar? Thank you, sir. Well, good evening, Morticia, Gomez. Uncle Fester, dear. - Boy, am I bushed. - Now, look, Fester Sorry, I'm busy. Working on a $15 million deal. You better make that $20 million. I hate odd numbers. - $20 million. The poor dear's sick. - We'd better get a psychiatrist. I'll look up one in the classified. Maybe he can explain this, too. Now, look, Logan. You may be the boss, but if you want to talk to me you will have to come over here. - All right, all right. I'll come over there. - Now that's better. Now, let me see, where was I? Oh, yes. You rang? Lurch, I'm in the midst of a big institutional deal and I misplaced a telephone number. It was on the back of a laundry ticket. Oh, you didn't see it, huh? I think I remember it. Let's see. Five, five. Five, five. Five, five, five. Hello? Hello! What? I don't like that merger deal. You don't like it? Who asked you? Nobody asked me, I'm telling you, smart guy. Oh, so now I'm a smart guy, huh? Well, you listen No, you listen. The deal's off! Oh, yeah? Well, you can say that again! You can't let these fellows push you around. Cybernetics, Cyclops, psychiatrist. Thank you, Thing. Here's one. "Dr. Brown. "Psychiatric service, 24 hours a day. "House calls and all credit cards honored. " Sounds like our man. Dr. Brown speaking. Yes? It all started when Uncle Fester fell in love with this girl with a stunning blond beard. Blond beard? A real blond beard? Well, personally, I'm sure she touches it up a little. And when we wouldn't give him a postage stamp, he went to pieces. Your Uncle Fester sounds at loose ends. Oh, he's very loose, and he needs help immediately. When I come to call, he shouldn't know that I'm a psychiatrist. It'll be best if you don't call me doctor. I'll use some other name. Is that agreeable? Perfectly. We'll be waiting for you, Doc Sir. Goodbye. A real beard? Thank you, Thing. Darling, the psychiatrist insists that we not call him doctor for fear of upsetting Uncle Fester. Good idea. We'll tell Fester he's the plumber. - Sir. - I'm Gomez Addams, Fester's nephew. - Well, I'm Mr. Logan. Thaddeus Logan. - Logan, huh? Well, that's as good a name as any. Come right in, Mr. Logan. We've been expecting you. Querida, this is Mr. Logan. Mr. Logan, this is my lovely wife, Morticia. Oh, Mr. Logan. How do you do? - Fester lives here? - Oh, yes. Won't you please sit down? There are a few things we think you ought to know about Uncle Fester. Oh? Well, I know all I need to know. By thunder, I admire your confidence. Lightning quick. Yes, it eases my mind to know that you'll be with him in his time of trouble. Oh, well, I don't anticipate any trouble. No, I got all the papers right here, ready to sign. Oh, we'll have those institutions eating out of our hand. Institution? Oh, no, we couldn't send him to an institution. No need, sir, he's an Addams, and we look after our own. Besides, the poor dear isn't violent. What are you talking about? I think you should know what made Uncle Fester crack up. Fester? Crack up? Completely off his trolley. Keeps talking about big business deals and mergers and that once fine mind has been reduced to a shambles. Oh, well, I know what you mean. Yeah, I often feel like I'm cracking up. You look it. But if what you say is true Why, it's ghastly. - Ghastly. - Ghastly. Now I get it. You, in these funny shoes and that preposterous suit. This is all a gag, isn't it? Yeah. Fester put you up to this, didn't he? Very amusing. I think the doctor could use some help himself. I guess he finally has cracked up. What is this all about? Oh, the children persuaded me to light up and ride my cycle around. Just for old times' sake. We love to watch him ride his motorcycle in the house. And wrestle the alligator. Wrestle the alligator? A live alligator? Not very sporting, wrestling a dead one. And I can beat Thing at Indian wrestling, too. Thing? Who is Thing? Thing? Come up and say hello to Mr. Logan. Oh, no. I've got to get out of here. Hey, just a minute. Come back here! What happened? Where's he going? Back to the mental clinic, where else? Mental clinic? We weren't supposed to tell you, but that's where he's from. Well, I'll be darned. You never know, do you? I could tell the minute he walked in. Well, it wasn't much fun. Fun? It only goes to show how dangerous working can be. That's right. Well, ho-hum. Don't worry, my dear. That glass is unbreakable. Cleopatra, please, dear. Think of all the less-fortunate African stranglers. That's my good, good girl. Boy, that's real musical milk. Yes, baby. Man. Show him in, Lurch. That's my sweet girl. Yes. Which one of them is disturbed? Oh, it was Uncle Fester, right there. Oh, yes. Yes, I can see he needs help immediately. - Who are you, old man? - You know. Is he violent? We gonna have trouble getting him into the clinic? Oh, Dr. Logan sent you. You can tell Dr. Logan it won't be necessary. He's completely recovered. He snapped right out of it. As you can see, he's completely normal. Normal? Sorry to get you out here on a false alarm, old man, but as you can see everything's right as rain at the Addams house. You fire us a bill along anyway and better luck next time. And do tell Dr. Logan I said he needs a long rest. - So do I. - You rang? Lurch, show the gentleman out, please. Good night. Doctors. Such a strange breed. I'm so glad you didn't crack up over Diana. Diana? Who's Diana? That ravishing creature you were going to marry. Oh, yeah. I guess she'd sort of slipped my mind. Well, I guess it's for the best. After all, she's a woman and I'm a man. What do we got in common? 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Oh, it's a lovely night. That looks wonderful, Gomez. Yeah, all it needs is a final touch. Absolutely breathtaking. All right, Lurch, let's have it. Thank you. No damage. Beautiful. Beautiful! Querida, let's have a go at the tower. Now, darling, that's Lurch's room. Besides, you've had enough fun for one day. Lurch can use the playroom. We can both take turns with the wrecking ball. Temperance, temperance. Too much of a good thing Besides, I have all of these bills to get out. Very well. Thank you, Lurch. Well, now. Let's see. Thank you. Darling, our phone bill has been unusually high this month. Have you been making any calls? Just to Saudi Arabia on that oil merger. I dialed four or five times before I got the right number. It's a bit expensive. Oil merger? Abigail Adams and the rest of those Boston one-D Adamses are trying to block the deal. In fact, they're trying to go to court to have me removed as executor to the family fortunes. A financial wizard like you? Abigail's always fancied herself as the head of the Addams family. Besides, she thinks I'm some kind of a nut. You? Impossible. She even tried to prove it in court once before. Good thing the judge fell asleep. Darling, if dear Abigail is as smart as she thinks she is, she'll drop this case. After all, the family fortune couldn't be in better hands. Could it? Never has the family been able to declare larger tax losses. There, that proves your financial genius. Tish, you just parlez vous. Hey! Somebody say something about Abigail Adams dropping the case? Well, it sure don't look like it. She's here in town. - She is? - Yeah. "Abigail Quincy Adams is in town on family business. "It is assumed she will mix business with pleasure "by visiting her grandchildren. " I didn't know she had grandchildren in this town. Well, whosever grandmother she is, thank goodness she's not our little Pugsley and Wednesday's grandmother. Actually, she's only a cousin by marriage. Still, I do think we ought to pay our respects and invite her over. Our worst enemy? I'm gonna faint! Quick! Water. Thank you, Thing. What's the matter with Fester? He heard Abigail Adams was in town. I guess the shock was too much for him. Better try my remedy. It always ends his spells. That felt good. Do it again. My turn. No, no, no, Gomez, darling. Now, put it down. I want to find out what this is all about. Morticia, Gomez just told you. Abigail is out to get him. - She has been shooting dirty pool. - She has? Well, then, she's not welcome in this house. Hold it. That Abigail probably has got spies all over the place. We better look around. Can't be too careful. The walls have ears. Interesting thought. Wednesday's in love, Wednesday's in love! Wednesday's in love! Now, you stop that, Pugsley. It's not nice to tease your sister, darling. Besides, she's been taking judo lessons. - See what I mean? - Yes, sir. By the way, has there been any phone calls for me? She means Robespierre Courtney. She's even doing her hair different for him. Yesterday she got so upset while waiting for his call that she let the trains run for 20 minutes without one crash. Wednesday, you didn't. Shocking waste of electricity. We could have recharged Uncle Fester I'm sorry, Father, but you don't measure love with dollars. That's a woman for you. That's love. I'm afraid it's unrequited. Poor little Wednesday's so upset. Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that child's so unhappy. I think I'll just go down to the cellar and wrestle with the alligator. Mama We can't think of our own selfish pleasures now. We must think of Wednesday. You're right, Morticia. The alligator can wait. Now, we must get Wednesday together with Robespierre. We've just got to get you together with Wednesday Addams. But you said you didn't want me to have anything to do with those kooks. That was before your mother found out the little girl was related to Abigail Quincy Adams. It just so happens that Abigail Quincy Adams is one of the most socially prominent women in America. Is that what you meant by riffraff? Mother was just trying to have her little joke. You want Mother to be the president of her club, don't you? Why don't you spell it out for the kid? Your mother wants you to wangle us an invitation to the Addams family. Then she can say she had tea with Abigail Quincy Adams and we can get our name in the society column. You're impossible. That makes us a perfect pair. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Courtney. Morticia Addams? Tea? Yes, we'd be delighted. Oh, of course I'll bring Robespierre. And how is dear grandmother? Splendid. Toodle-oo. We're going to have tea with the Addams family! Hurray for our side. Isn't that nice? She especially asked about you, Mama. I always was the popular one in the family. You know, I do think I'd better have a talk with Wednesday. You know, woman to woman. I can give her a few helpful hints. Querida, you are to romance what Mama is to dignity and charm. Darling. Oh, that dress does do things for you. Black is such a happy color. Now, remember, my dear, in all your relationships with boys, you must be shy and modest. Yes, Mother. Poise and good manners are important, too. For instance, when Robespierre comes, I think it would be proper for you to curtsy. - Curtsy? - Yes, let's try it. In this dress? I see what you mean. Let's forget about the curtsy. - Now, what are you going to talk about? - My spiders. That's marvelous. If the spiders don't get him, and being shy and modest doesn't get him, use the trap. Good hunting. Very becoming. I like the style. Still, dressing isn't everything when it comes to pleasing a young man. A young lady has to know all the latest steps. So, Thing, if you don't mind That's it! By george, I think you've got it! But, just in case the dance doesn't work, try this. Very nice. Very nice. But there's just one thing that boys can't resist. A nice long face. Beautiful. But just in case that doesn't work Good. Good. But you know what attracts a man most? - Money? - No. Hair, a woman's hair. See? And you're my type. Perfect. But just in case the hair doesn't work What's that? Love dust. What advice do you have for me, Lurch? Oh, I love you. Nothing like a bit of cricket to while away an hour or two. Darling, are you sure this is the way it's played? Querida, I was the scourge of the fields of Eton. I can hit the ball with my eyes shut. Serve it up. Yes, dear. Oh, darling, I'm so sorry. Nothing at all. I did make contact. That must be the Courtneys. Let Lurch get them. Once more, my dear. The Courtneys. Gomez Addams here. How do you do? And this is my lovely wife, Morticia. How do you do? I guess you folks go in for pop art. Or something. So, this is Wednesday's little friend Robespierre. Oh, yes. He certainly looks it. I'll call Wednesday. Wednesday, darling? Come along, dear, and say hello to your little friend. Wednesday, what was that? Love dust. Children today. So precocious. Would you children like to go out and play in the cave? No. - In the swamp? - No. Did you say cave? And swamp? It's not much, but room enough to romp. Wednesday, darling, why don't you and Robespierre go and play with the trains? Would you like that, Robespierre? Well, all right. Spirited little fellow you have there. Please, come in. Please, sit down. I suppose you'd like to meet the rest of the family? After all, a child is a product of its environment. Will you excuse us? Oh, Cousin Itt! Your cousin? He's up in the fireplace? Loves privacy. Itt, are you there? He's there, all right. Itt, please, come down. There are some people here we want you to meet. Mr. And Mrs. Courtney, this is our Cousin Itt. Cousin what? Not What, Itt. He always says the right thing. Morticia, I can't get this thing tight enough. Dear, you're so helpless. This is the only thing that cures his headaches. Fester, these are Robespierre's parents. Oh, hi. Who's Robespierre? He's the little tyke Wednesday's set her cap for. Oh. When's the wedding? Now, look, they're just children. This is just a social call. We've always admired Abigail Adams. Abigail! Excuse us. Honey, do you know a good divorce lawyer? Henry, rich people are all eccentric. Nobody is that rich. I know a spy when I see one. He has the face of THRUSH. And did you see all those pens in his pocket? Microphones. Are you sure? Have I ever been wrong? Now don't answer that. Now, Itt, you keep an eye out Well, you just stand guard. Come on. Watch. Look, why don't we just say hello to Abigail Adams and get out of here? What's your hurry? Hey! Very interesting pens you have there. Yeah. Be more interesting especially if they had ink in them. Oh, you You Oh, dear. Don't worry. We'll do something about the dress. But you must admit, it does look better in a darker shade. Now, go on, then. Which one has the microphone? Microphone? Uncle Fester has an uncanny sense about these things. Uncanny? Excuse us. Eleanor, I want to be fair about this. You may have custody of Robespierre. What if Abigail calls all those witnesses and gets Gomez back in court again? Dear, that could be dangerous. Cara, was Stonewall Addams afraid? When he led his troops into battle? When he flunked his physical. I have it. I shall win our friends over with a demonstration of the Gomez Addams financial wizardry. Then can I shoot them in the back? There will be no violence. Count me out. Itt, I'll play you a game of solitaire in the chimney. Come on. Come, dear. Querida, maybe we should let Fester take a shot. He hasn't got very good aim. Your way is the honorable way. Courtney, how would you like to become rich? We only came here to meet Nonsense, Mr. Courtney. It's really quite painless. And besides, it's the least we can do after ruining Mrs. Courtney's dress. Old man, you're buying yourself Yes, I have a private line to my broker. - Blooker - Now, wait a minute. I can't afford 10,000 shares of anything. No problem. We'll just have them pick up 1,000 for you. My husband is so understanding. I'm getting out of this booby trap. Robespierre! Blooker, cancel that order. My, but your husband's a jumpy one. Robespierre. Oh, Mr. Courtney, I'm so glad you decided to stay. Blooker, cancel that cancellation. Lurch, put Mr. Courtney in the good chair. Blooker, buy 1,000 shares of Consolidated Lint and charge it to Henry Courtney. C-O-U-R-T-N-E-Y. Courtney. Well, I'll give you all the details in the morning. Yes, I'll hold on. Please At 86, eh? Good work, Blooker. Congratulations, old man, you're on the road to success. I don't want 1,000 shares of Consolidated Lint. Now, now, Mr. Courtney. A deal's a deal. Let's see how you're doing. Just as I thought. Consolidated Lint, 86 and a half. - 82. - 82? Isn't this exciting? Sell, please sell. Sell. Too late. 62 and an eighth. Excuse me, please. Darling. I'm not too sure, but I don't think Mr. Courtney is very happy in Consolidated Lint. Well, we can certainly take care of that. I'll swing him into National Dust. Blooker, sell Courtney's Consolidated Lint. And pick up 1,000 shares of National Dust. Please, you can thank me some other time. - Good show, Blooker. - Hurry, darling. Let's see what it's doing. Did it go up? By george, it's up eight and a half points. - National Dust? - Consolidated Lint. - Back to 70. - What about National Dust? Down three. Bad business, shifting horses in mid-stream. I'm sure dear Abigail knows that as well as anyone. Consolidated Lint. Up to 75. - Up to 80. - And National Dust? Holding steadily at 54. It pays to buy the better stock. But it's not paying me. If you make me stick to this deal, I'll be broke, bankrupt, penniless. Nonsense, old man. If you're a bit short, I'll take the deal off your hands. - Oh, thank you. - You're all even again. - Thank you. - Ever make a better deal than that? Oh, no, never. Never. Thank you, Mr. Addams. Easy come, easy go. And now if we could just meet old Mrs. Adams. As soon as she's finished wrestling the alligator. Wrestling the alligator? Ah, here she is. Well, I finally beat that darn alligator. Dear, Mr. And Mrs. Courtney have been dying to meet you. She certainly photographs differently. Do you really wrestle alligators? Oh, just once in a while. She actually prefers kangaroos. This is Abigail Quincy Adams? Certainly not. I wouldn't have that woman in this house. Robespierre! I'll have Lurch get your hat. Oh, please get my hat. The bell's out of order. Well, think nothing of it. You rang? The gentleman's hat, please, Lurch. Robespierre! Did you call me, Mother? What have they done to you? First she made me blow up the train, and then she wanted to put me in the guillotine just because my name is Robespierre. My husband is going to write a letter to the papers about this. How can I? All my pens are broken. Let's get out of here. What's the matter with them? Soreheads. Oh, poor Wednesday's going to be broken-hearted. Where's Robespierre? Well, darling, I'm afraid you're going to have to forget about Robespierre. Forget? I've already forgotten. He wouldn't even play with Pugsley's octopus. That just proves it. He's not our type. Poor boy. But as you yourself say, darling, children are products of their environment. Morticia! You called? Pugsley and I are ready. Ah, good. You're so thorough, Gomez. So efficient, so precise. You know me so well, querida. Giving our congressman two ways to beautify America. I like the swinging ball, but this may do the job better and faster. - You ready, Pugsley? - Ready, sir. To improve the American landscape. Back to nature. Beautiful, Gomez. Beautiful! I'll have to speak to that newsboy. I've told him we wanted the paper delivered through the back window. Cara mia, look. "Abigail Adams returning to Boston. "Drops plans for fight over Addams Family fortune control. " Now, isn't that nice? The Courtneys must have given us a good report. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family No! No. How's the market, dear? Closed. I just do this to keep in practice. Very sensible. If there's another crash, you'll be ready for it. Well, I was ready for that one. Pugsley's new chemistry set. He's making a different kind of TNT. Those educational toys certainly keep a boy out of mischief. Wish I could say the same for Uncle Fester. I caught him cheating at checkers. Inexcusable! Unless he was playing for money. Well, time for my Zen-Yogi. I really had to discipline him. He's forbidden to leave the house all day. Thank heavens. There for a moment I thought he was going to leave. The mail's in. Thank you, Thing. - Bill? - It's from my sister, Ophelia. Why would she send us a bill? Darling, it's not a bill. The poor dear's in trouble, and she needs our help desperately. What's the problem? She was too upset to say. Who could that be? It may not be a who. It may be a what. - Dreamer. - Telegram. Thank you very much, Lurch. Oh, it's from Ophelia. Didn't wait very long for an answer. What's it say? "Help. " Sounds like an excited caller. Either that or the doorbell's stuck. Miss Ophelia. Ophelia! We haven't heard from you in nearly two minutes. Dear Ophelia! Unburden yourself, darling. Tell us everything. Aren't you gonna tell us about your trouble? Trouble? What trouble? Oh, that trouble. My life is ruined. - Sounds kind of serious. - A man? Brilliant, charming, cultured. - Rich! - Alive? Yes, I'm almost sure he was alive. My mother objects. Granny Frump? Egad, she must be sick. Why? She says if he's in love with me, there must be something wrong with him. That's a point. Nonsense. You're a lovely, intelligent girl, and we're going to help you. She certainly needs help. The first thing we should do is meet your intended. When can we see him? This is my beloved. Horatio Bartholomew, at your service. How positively continental. Have you spent much time in Europe, Mr. Bartholomew? All my life. Oxford, Cambridge, University of Heidelberg. Oh, my Apollo. My Ariel! My knight in shining armor. You'll have to forgive Ophelia. She's a bit shy with men. I've searched the world over. I've never met anyone like her. I'll buy that. We want to fly away together. Roam the seven seas. Search the far corners of the Earth. But first, we'll have a spot of lunch. Thank you, Lurch. Magnificent lunch. I should be honored to have your recipe for the cherries jubilee. Cherries jubilee? Oh, that was flambeau of jellyfish. Flambeau of jellyfish? How did you two get together? Mama, please! They're not on the witness stand. How did you two get together? It was at this wonderful Ionely hearts club luau. I looked over the suckling pig, and there she was. Well, if you have so much money, what were you doing at a Ionely hearts club? Mama, please! What were you doing at a Ionely hearts club? I was looking for a simple girl. You sure struck oil. Well, it's time for a walk in the garden. Allow me. I just love when she does that. Come, Horatio. My love. Well, querida, what do you think? - He's charming. - Rich. - Attractive. - Magnetic. - Impossible. - Exactly. Too perfect. The man's an obvious phony. An imposter. How shall we prove it? Simple matter. He claims he's rich. I'll call Brad and Dunstreet, the financial authorities. Excellent thinking, darling. One of them is bound to be in. Hello, Brad and Dunstreet? Gomez Addams here. Try to keep a civil tongue in your head. Just making an enquiry. What do you have on Horatio Bartholomew? Yes, I'll wait. They're running him through their computer. The marvels of science. They're running him through their computer, and he's walking in our garden. All at the same time. Amazing. What? Yes. Are you sure? Thank you. Just as I thought. They never heard of Horatio Bartholomew. Oh, my darling sister. In the hands of a scheming adventurer. A Ionely hearts club bluebeard! Poor Ophelia. If your Cousin Itt hadn't been such a playboy, they might be married by now. Perhaps we can have another talk with the little roué. Roué. That's French. I wish you'd said that. Darling, please. Let's concentrate on Cousin Itt. What? - Cousin Itt. - Oh, yes, yes! Oh, Cousin Itt. At least we know he's up there. Let me try, dear. Careful of the soot. Okay, dear. Cousin Itt! Would you come down, please? We'd like to have a little chat with you. Itt, you come down here this minute! Well, now we know another thing. The chimney needs cleaning. Cousin Itt! If you don't come down I'm going to be very hurt. I scared you down, didn't I? Cousin Itt, you know how fond we are of you. Thank you. You do put things so nicely. Itt, we think you are perfect husband material. Suave, sophisticated, cultured. Yes, and loaded, too. Now, with women throwing themselves at you all the time, of course you've probably become a bit jaded. That's true. If a person is going to become jaded, that is the best way. But we think it's time that you settle down, got married. Itt, are you still with us? Good. We have the perfect mate for you. My darling sister, Ophelia. Bachelors. Always playing hard to get. I didn't realize your sister was such a swinger. Faster! Faster! Faster! Ophelia, where are you? Horatio. What have you done with the swing? I've got it right here, dear. My goodness! Don't worry, dear. I'll catch you. That was fun. I just love it when you do things like that. I must save my poor deluded sister from the clutches of that beast. Right. She's deluded enough without him. But I love Horatio. The man's a bounder and a cad. And not a very nice one. He's the only one that loves me. I know he loves me. The daisies told me so. Ophelia. Are you going to listen to the daisies or to Mama? What do you see? I see a man with a Heidelberg scar and a bushy mustache. That's the blackguard. Mama, tell Ophelia the truth about this man. He's loaded, elegant and unattached. And if you ask me, he'd make Ophelia a perfect husband. Mama, either you're out of practice or that ball needs repairing. That scoundrel must have tampered with it. Very well then. Get your own crystal ball. The cleverness of the fiend. Even fooling Mama. Oh, shame, shame. To pillory that poor man with your outrageous slings and arrows. Oh, Horatio, my love. I'm coming. You're going the wrong way, dear. He's upstairs in Uncle Fester's room. Flying to her destruction like a moth to a flame. - What do we do? - Blow out the flame. This is fun. Ophelia. Locking yourself up this way isn't going to solve the problem. I'm going to stay in here until I perish. But, darling, what good would you be to Horatio dead? Interesting point. Ophelia, the man is not only a scoundrel, he doesn't even have a job. But, darling, you don't have a job, either. Exactly, one playboy in the family is enough. Besides, he's a liar, claims to have been at Heidelberg. Should be easy enough to disprove that. Well, of course. We'll simply call the Heidelberg Dean of Men. Not necessary! All Heidelbergers are expert swordsmen. I'll just get down the sabers and test this blowhard. Hope you don't mind a friendly exchange of steel, Bartholomew. Not at all. You'll forgive me if I'm a bit rusty. Rusty, eh? You beginning to get the drift, Ophelia? All right, choose your weapons. Now, the moment Lurch drops his handkerchief, we begin. Just a minute, old boy. Let's wait till the handkerchief hits the floor. Sorry. Whenever you're ready. Bravo, Gomez. Wonderful evasive action. Now all I have to do is evade the furniture. Allow me. None of your trickery here, old man. Sorry, Bruno. Would you like to wrestle? You were magnificent, dear. Where did the coward go? Upstairs, to wash the blood off his hands. - Blood on his hands, eh? - Your blood. Now will you help Horatio and me plot our troth? Really, Ophelia. Would you marry a penniless imposter? Penniless. Horatio? You'll soon laugh on the other side of your daisies. Are we going to call Brad and Dunstreet again? There are other ways to unmask a braggart. Braggart, come down here and bring some money. Darling, don't you think you'd better let Mr. Bartholomew cut the cards? Too risky. Excuse me, it's time to feed Cleopatra. On with the game, Bartholomew. Horatio, pick a daisy for luck. That one must have taken root. Try another. My love. Well, what about $200, just for openers? I should go out. Nothing like hard cash on the line to weed out the ribbon clerks. However, just for sociability, I'll see your $200 and raise you $200. Just as I thought. Phony. That bill is yours. Strange. Uncle Fester's picture is on there. I told him to keep his Monopoly money out of this drawer. All right! Here's that $200, your $200, and $500 more. Raise him back, Horatio. Raise him back. If it will amuse you, dear. Your $500, and I'll raise you $500. That is if you'll accept a check. I knew we'd get to the check ploy. We're playing for cash, Bartholomew, not paper. Very well, then. I'll raise you $100. All right, ribbon clerk. What do you have? A pair of deuces. Deuces? That's good. I thought you were bluffing. Still, he isn't exactly penniless. So he carried a few extra kopecks around in his pocket. Tactic number one in the fortune-seekers' manual. Darling, you know so much about the world. I've lived in it all my life. Still, it grieves me to see that sweet, charming creature in the clutches of that abominable monster. Gomez! Dear Horatio decided he didn't want the money he won from you. Maybe we misjudged the monster. He gave it all away. Blackguard. Probably leave you for the first pretty ankle that comes along. Fiddle-dee-dee. Prove it. Gomez can't, but I can. Morticia! Don't worry, darling. I'll lead him to the brink and stop him at the gate. It'll do you no good. I'm the blonde. And I'm more fun. Yes, I am. Did you want to see me about something? Not something. Us. Gomez and Ophelia have gone out. We're all alone. Just the two of us, together. Care to play checkers? Oh, what a tight leash you have on your passions, dear. Come, sit beside me. If he lays a hand on her, I'll kill him. And give him a piece of my mind, too. Wouldn't you be more comfortable here? I'm quite all right here. That's better. When you first entered this house, you must have felt the vibrations. True, I have. But it's an old house. It's bound to have a few vibrations. Horatio, why do you resist me? Because I'm in love with your sister. Excuses, excuses. Take me. Take you where? I knew you couldn't resist me. Mrs. Addams, you're beautiful, charming, cultured, talented, intelligent, witty, rich and completely feminine. You're just not my type. Not your type? How dare you insult my wife. So you've been watching! This entire day has been nothing but a silly test. I love you for what you are. Whatever that is. And I love you for what you are. Whatever that is. Thank you, Thing. Hello. Morticia Addams speaking. Oh, yes. Just a moment. Gomez, dear. It's Brad and Dunstreet calling back about Mr. Bartholomew. Hello, Mr. Dunstreet. Sorry. Hello, Mr. Brad. Really? Yes, I see. Yes, that is interesting. Thank you. Nailed him as a draft dodger, too, eh? Seems there's been a slight mistake. They were checking out a Mr. Henry Bartholomew. Who's he? A fraud, a forger, and a draft dodger. Henry Bartholomew is definitely out. What about Horatio? Well, he's not the richest man in the world. He's the second richest man in the world. We'll apologize to him forthwith. Mr. Bartholomew, I'm afraid we owe you an apology. Yes, indeed, Bartholomew, old man. We've misjudged you. Oh, well! You're not only acceptable to this family, I'm going to see to it that you're a full-fledged member of the Zen-Yogi society. - Zen-Yogi? - The only true way to inner peace. - Ridiculous. - Ridiculous? Some of the men in our family, the Frump family, have found inner peace swinging from a chandelier. - Absurd. - Absurd? Perhaps you'd prefer a simple romp in the swamp. - Nonsense. - Nonsense? But, Horatio, a man who doesn't like to stand on his head or swing from a chandelier or have a simple romp in the swamp is maladjusted. Lucky me. Lucky me, for finding out in time. Ophelia, he's the second richest man in the world. My mother taught me never to settle for second best. A true Frump. It will take a long time for my wounds to heal. But I'll get over it. You mean it? You really want to marry Ophelia? You dear, sweet, lovable creature. That Ophelia. A one-man woman. Darling, are you sure you know how to saw a woman in half? Positive. It's putting her together again I'm not sure of. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Oh, it's from Ophelia. Oh, she says she and Itt had a lovers' quarrel, and the engagement is off. But she's found a new love. I like a girl who can bounce back. What's he like? Well, she says he's not only rich, charming and handsome, but he also claims to be Napoleon. Napoleon? Sounds like the perfect match. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family A little higher and to the right, Thing. Yes. That's it. Thank you, Thing. The mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Oh, Lurch, it's for you. Aren't you going to open it and see what's in it? I already know. It's your annual invitation to the Butlers' Ball. Which you never accept. Lurch, wouldn't you like to go to that ball just once? Why doesn't he want to go to that ball? He's becoming progressively shyer. Did it ever occur to you that he might not be normal? Nonsense, my dear. He's just as normal as you and l. But he should go to that ball. It would be very good for him. He needs to get out more. Make more friends. Perhaps you're right. But I can handle this situation. I'm sure you can, darling. You're so masterful. Tish, when you pat my cheek that way it drives me wild. -Gomez, darling, control yourself. -Never. Darling, you're forgetting about Lurch. You rang? Yes, Lurch, I think we have a problem. -The problem is you, Lurch. -Me? Mrs. Addams and I have had a serious talk about you, Lurch, and we've decided that this year you should attend the Butlers' Ball. Lurch, there's something behind this. What is it? You can tell us. -I'm a wallflower. -What? I can't dance. It's so simple. You can learn in no time. "Come, and trip it as ye go On the light fantastic toe" -Shakespeare. -Milton. -By Jove, you're right. -Lurch, you can learn to dance. The Watusi, the Hully Gully, the Pick and Shovel Oh, no. -You must develop some outside interests. -You can become stagnant. Really? Look at Mr. Addams. He's always developing outside interests. Right now I have the most enviable collection of coroner's reports in the neighborhood. Lurch, we're speaking to you this way because you're more than an employee to us. You're like one of the family. And as head of the family I've decided that you're going to the Butlers' Ball. It's for your own good, Lurch. We wanna make you happy. Look, it's so simple. One, two, three. One, two, three. -We'll get you a teacher. -That's a marvelous idea, dear. Why don't you call the dance studio and have them send over an instructress right away? -A girl? -Well, of course. -Father was right. -About what, Lurch? My being a butler. What did he want you to be? A jockey. Okay, Mrs. Marshall, we'll send an instructress right over. Yes, I'll make sure she's young. Dorothy. Go over to Mrs. Marshall's. Her grandfather wants to learn the Mashed Potato. Please, Mr. Walters, give me another chance. Sally, I'm sorry. You're too fresh to the customer. But, Mr. Walters Fred Walters Dance Studio. I'm sorry, we got nobody available. I'm available. Mr. Addams, we suddenly have somebody available. Yeah, right. Girlie, anything you earn on this job is all yours. Here. Good luck. Dance instructress should be here any minute now. Morticia, who moved this urn? I don't know, darling. Mama, I suppose. I didn't notice. Really, my dear. You should keep an eye on these things. You know how close Uncle Droop liked being to Aunt Drip. -Must be the instructress. -GOMEZ: Lurch. -Yes, sir. -Dance instructress is here, Lurch. Now, come, Lurch. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a question of rhythm, Lurch. We'll leave you alone and let you have complete privacy. There's no need to be self-conscious. Excellent idea. Oh, and, Lurch, do try to be a little friendly. Let her see that charming leer of yours. Great form, Lurch. But you're not keeping time to the music. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Rhythm, Lurch. Rhythm. GOMEZ: One, two, three. One, two, three. She's fainted, sir. Fainted? That's strange. Why would she do that? Here, put her on the sofa. What's the matter with the lady? Well, there she goes again. Pugsley, take your toad out of here. Things like this upset him. She's obviously not a well person. Quick. Someone get a glass of water. Thank you, Thing. Well, there she goes again. What's all the commotion, Gomez? Fred Walters sent us a fainter. Oh. Well, maybe we better get her some smelling salts. Thank you, Thing. I'll have to make a complaint. Oh, no, don't do that. I always faint when I meet new people. Oh, you poor dear, you must be painfully shy. Oh, no, I'm really very friendly. One, two, three. One, two, three. Not me, him. Oh, sorry. All right, buster. I didn't know fainting was contagious. Practicing your sword swallowing, darling? No, I just felt a little congestion in my throat. That cleared it up fine. Dear, I can't find Lurch. He did seem depressed by all that Butlers' Ball talk. You don't suppose he did anything drastic, do you? Of course not. Otherwise your little vulture would be circling the area. That's true. I'm going to have the children look for him. Little Pugsley has the nose of a bloodhound. As a matter of fact, it's his best feature. Lurch? Lurch? Where are you, Lurch? Lurch! The playroom? It isn't nice to tattle, Thing, but thank you anyways. Lurch? Where are you, Lurch? It's me, Wednesday. Do you hear me? Thank you, Thing. That's not nice. Don't you trust me? I'm your friend. Just because we want you to go to the Butlers' Ball? WEDNESDAY: lt'll be fun. I like being miserable. You might find a nice girl to be miserable with. -I'll teach you to dance. -You? Grandmama taught me. She's a great dancer. Really. I'll have you dancing in no time. Now smile. That's much better. Morticia, Consolidated Fuzz just hit 212. I sold it for six. Saved all that tax. Brilliant. Darling, I want you to know that Wednesday has taught Lurch how to dance. Capital. She wants us to come and see right now. Of course. I knew Lurch would pick it up quickly. He's such a nimble one. Ready. No! Morticia, Consolidated Fuzz is back to six. -Oh. -I bought in again at 212. What an unusual system you have, dear. Darling, I want to talk to you about Lurch. Ballet doesn't seem to be his cup of tea. No. I think he needs something more modern. -So I've decided to teach him. -Wonderful. I can just see his face. You, Mrs. Addams? You don't know what you're missing, Lurch. Mrs. Addams won the Twist award at the Funeral Directors' Ball. They awarded her the silver urn. Darling, you'll have me blushing. On with the dance. That's it, Lurch. Now you're getting it. -What's the matter? -I think he slipped a cog. Poor dear, I believe he overdid it. He must have thrown his back out. Excellent diagnosis, child. Don't worry, Lurch. You're in the finest hands since Dr. Schweitzer. Oh, it's true, Lurch. Mr. Addams' treatment for Grandmama's back had the whole medical world agog. Agog? Aghast. Not so hard, dear. He's tall enough already. Sorry, my love. I don't know my own strength. GOMEZ: He's turning a beautiful shade of red. It's more magenta. A very popular color this year. Well, we better give it another go. Well, one more. Darling, you've done it again. -He's as good as new. -Another triumph for medical science. Some day the Nobel Prize. -Couldn't accept it. -Why not? Run off to Sweden and leave the children? Of course you're right. More. More. Oh, no, Lurch. This could become habit-forming. Now, on your feet and on with the dancing lesson. Darling Dear, I think Lurch is a bit shy with you. Should we call for another instructress? Waste of smelling salts. Lurch not only needs a great teacher but also a great psychologist, a brilliant tactician, a rigid taskmaster. You? I never could fool you. Now remember, Lurch. You're not dancing with Mr. Addams. It's not me, Lurch. It's a beautiful senorita. Fiery, alluring, smoldering. And you, Lurch, are the proud prince of the Pampas. You draw the senorita closer. -What's wrong, Lurch? -You didn't shave. Senoritas never do. By Jove, I think he's got it. What was that? Quick. The rack! Darling, I thought the rack helped your back. Oh, it did. It did. I'm just resting up a bit. Wonderful idea. Here. Lurch is getting into his new costume. Little Wednesday picked it out. I know. I'm afraid his heart's still not in it, though. Darling, do you think we're doing the right thing, making him go? We must not indulge fear. I remember my Cousin Blob. -Deathly afraid of ghosts. -Ghosts? Now he's one himself. Yes. I hear him on dark stormy nights. Darling, those strange sounds from the attic aren't Cousin Blob. -No? -They're Grandma Squint. You can tell from her superb cackle. Yes. Like music to my ears. Lurch, you look magnificent. MORTlClA: That costume. It's you. -Must l? -Lurch, it's for your own good. Darling, what do you think? Fascinating, my dear. But what is it? It's my costume for the Butlers' Ball. But you mustn't breathe a word of it to Lurch. I want to make sure that he's not too alone. That's very thoughtful, querida. But don't worry. The girls will flutter about him like moths around a flame. And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the annual Fred Walters Dance Contest. By special request, we're gonna have a tango. Here he comes. That was a wonderful thing you did, Tish. Oh, darling, I didn't do anything. Besides, I'm just glad to be out of that horrible costume and back into my beautiful dress. You didn't do so badly yourself. How did you get them to change it to a tango contest? I promised them a large contribution to their pet charity. How nice of them to have charities for pets. Well, it's been a tiring day. I think I'll go down and relax a bit on the nail bed. Yes. Darling, you think of everything. Good morning, my dear. You seem quite happy. I am, darling. My thorns came in so nice and pointy this year. They talk about green thumbs. You've got a red thumb. Hello? -It's the fainter. -The dance instructress? Hello? Yes. Oh, that's wonderful, Miss O'Rourke. Fine. Goodbye. She says her boss found out about Lurch winning the contest and he's given her a long-term contract. Oh, that's wonderful. Darling, you know, she did encourage Lurch. I think we ought to buy her a nice gift. Yes. But what? I've got it. A great big bottle of smelling salts. She can use it. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Marvelous idea, Morticia, putting this old saw together again. I thought it would be nice for Uncle Fester. This is fun. Makes me all goose-bumpy. It's always so exciting seeing how these games turn out. Just about another foot to go, old man. Zounds. - The electricity's gone off. - Sure! I knew something would spoil it. Now, now, Uncle Fester, it only missed you by a hair. No matter, I'll get another fuse. No, forget it. I'm out of the mood now. I'll be up in my tree house. Gomez, darling, wasn't that the doorbell? I believe it was. That means the electricity is okay. It must have been Uncle Fester who blew a fuse. I'll have Pugsley bring him a fresh one. Miss Ophelia. Ophelia, what a surprise. Oh, dear brother-in-law, you behold the most miserable of women. Well, you are that. But what happened? Throckmorton didn't like that. He jilted me. Montrose didn't like it. Throckmorton didn't like it. Bunch of spoilsports. Well, look on the bright side, Ophelia. Just because you've been jilted once or twice, it doesn't mean you are unattractive. You're very attractive, and strong as an ox. - Hi, Aunt Ophelia. - Oh, Pugsley, this is a tragic day. What happened? Throckmorton didn't like that. Now, Pugsley, you can see why your Aunt Ophelia's heart is broken. Her heart and my back. Ophelia, I thought I heard you. Oh, Uncle Fester, you behold a most wretched woman. Say, you do look better. Ophelia's been jilted. - Again? - Practically left at the altar. What happened? Throckmorton didn't like being judoed. You sure do have a weakness for weirdoes. Nobody loves me for myself. Well, that's understandable. Have you tried offering money? But, Father, isn't that undignified? Very, and besides, it doesn't work. Oh, cheer up, Aunt Ophelia, you'll make a very nice old maid. Ophelia, maybe you're a bit too anxious. Men like their women mysterious, elusive. That's my type. I'm afraid I should go upstairs and rest. I just have no more strength. You see, he only went six feet. There's no hope for me. Did I hear my sister Ophelia? - Who else leaves me black and blue? - Oh, mon cher. - That's French. - Darling, please, Ophelia first. I'm next. Well, I think I'll go work on Ophelia's problem. Oh, poor Ophelia. She seems destined not to find love. Perhaps we could find something to divert her. Some sort of career, perhaps. Maybe she could go to Japan and take up sumo wrestling. She tried that. That's how she lost Horatio. I have it, science. The world needs another Madame Curie. Excellent! We'll give her a few of Pugsley's chemicals, and she can mix, mix, mix until she discovers something. - But what? - I don't know. Perhaps she could mix herself another man. I think I'm beginning to get something. You know, this reminds me of Sir Newton Addams. When he made his scientific discoveries? No, when he set his house on fire. Oh, yes, that was the high point of his career. - Well, shall we begin? - Right. - Powder. - Powder. - Water. - Water. - Hydrochloric acid. - Hydrochloric acid. - Tincture of benzoin. - Tincture of benzoin. - Salicylic acid. - Salicylic acid. Uncle Fester, you keep giving me the same test tube all the time. Yeah, I know, I mixed them all together. It saves test tubes. Very shrewd. - Now then, the black bottle. - The black bottle. - The white bottle. - The white bottle. - The blue bottle. - The blue bottle. - The green bottle. - The green bottle. - No, you don't. - Why not? That's my after-shave lotion. - Uncle Fester, that's sulfuric acid. - Yeah, I know, it's real tangy. There's something about a sulfuric acid man. There's nothing like a quiet afternoon of culture. Darling, perhaps Ophelia should devote herself to art. You may be right. Science doesn't seem to be it. Here it is 3:00. Ophelia's been up there mixing chemicals for two hours and nothing. Well, we must be patient with these new scientists. After all, dear, she hasn't the faintest idea of what she is doing. See, I think she stumbled onto something. - Sounds like something big. - I'll go see what it is. Congratulations, Ophelia. What happened? I discovered that if I mixed the blue stuff with the green stuff Well, science is definitely out. But don't worry, we'll think of something. There's no hope for me. 'Tis the last rose of summer That is blooming all alone That is exquisite, unbelievable. It's this room. This room of art and beauty. Ophelia, we've found your career. You could be an opera singer. Me, an opera singer? - Well, you'll have to put on a little weight. - Oh, I will, I will. Yes, your voice will need a little polishing and I know just the right little polish. - Cousin Itt. - Exactly, I'll go find him. Oh, Cousin Itt. - Morticia, I have wonderful news. - What is it, dear? Ophelia is on a threshold of a new career. I know, she told me all about it. Isn't it exciting? Certainly is. Cousin Itt! Itt, now you come down here this minute. Playful and sneaky, too. My dear, would you mind giving it a try? Cousin Itt, it's an emergency. No, Cousin Itt, the house isn't on fire. But we do have another emergency. Ophelia wants to learn how to sing. Wait. We need you. Gomez, darling, are you sure Cousin Itt is our man? He spent 15 years at the West African Institute for Music. - Teaching? - Supplying hair for violin bows. Oh, well, in that case, Cousin Itt, what do you think sister Ophelia's chances are? Certainly, you have an opinion? With lots of hard work. And serious intense study. That's your considered opinion? Well, at least there's hope. And a true artist lives on hope, as long as he has a strong constitution. We'll start immediately. I'll have Lurch accompany Ophelia. Oh, dear, this one's out of order. No problem. You rang? Lurch, how would you like to be Ophelia's accompanist? Dear Lurch, he's such an enthusiast. Cousin Itt, take over. Darling, I think we should leave the music lovers alone. Lurch will get Ophelia. Let's go to the playroom and read. I've got a better idea. Let's go to the playroom and play. - Hang onto these. - Thank you, darling. Now, it's really quite simple. When Fester blows the whistle, play starts. The first player to get the puck to the opposite wall scores. Oh, but darling, isn't this supposed to be played on the ice? - That's too slippery. - Very sensible. - All right, you two. Are you ready? - Ready. Gomez, darling, I do believe he's trying to tell us something. Come now, Fester, speak up. Oh, now, Fester, you can speak more clearly than that. Oh, my, Ophelia upstairs studying opera, and now this. We're getting to be quite a musical family. Either that or he swallowed his whistle. Uncle Fester, I've warned you about those between-meal snacks. Querida, how many calories in a whistle? Well, are you ready? Now, back to the game. Gomez, darling, don't you think we should check on Ophelia? Cousin Itt must have her singing like a bird now. - A canary? - A vulture. Dreamer! We couldn't stand the suspense any longer. How goes it with our little songbird? Dear Cousin Itt, he's taught me everything he knows. Even more? Generous to a fault. Well, fire away. By george, he has taught her everything he knows. Down to the last But, Cousin Itt, in opera, don't they sing in Italian? That was Italian? Really temperamental, those long hairs. Oh, dear, just as my career was blossoming, it's nipped in the bud. Not yet, Ophelia dear, we'll get you another teacher. I know just the man, Ophelia. Signor Bellini. Darling, are you sure he's available for house calls? Querida, Signor Bellini is an artist. And artists are always ready to sacrifice for art, if the price is right. Let's see how much money we have on hand. You rang? Now that's what I call functional art. We're out of petty cash, Lurch. In the barrel, please. Thank you, Lurch. More in ice-box. Good thinking. There's nothing like cold cash. Stop. Stop, stop! Is something wrong, Signor Bellini? No, except that in my 20 years of coaching the greats, near greats and even ingrates, I have never heard such squawking, squeaking and screeching from a human throat. I have a feeling Signor Bellini isn't too impressed. Nonsense. These maestros only abuse the students they love. Shall we try it again, maestro? Who cares? I've already got ulcers. Is that better, signor? Would you like me to show you just how much better? Yes, Signor Bellini, yes. Temper. You're right. I could have broken a perfectly good cane. He's really a taskmaster. He's trying to bring Ophelia out. If he ever hits her, they'll have to carry her out. Signorina Frump, I can't take anymore today. Tomorrow I come back for another fee Lesson. - Just practice. - Which part shall I practice? Sing them all. All at once, for all I care. Oh, you mean like this? Could you do that again? Or didn't I hear what I heard? Oh, joy to the world, I have charmed my maestro with my simple triple-stop, double-vibrato vocal harmonium. A musical miracle. It's amazing. Beneath all that mediocrity she has hidden talent. Perhaps we can bring it out. If she is willing to work, and you're willing to pay. We'll pay anything. What does she have to do? First, she must empty her mind of everything. That should be no problem. - She must sing day and night. - Day and night? - Night and day. - Oh, that one she knows. Starting with scales, she must work five hours a day. If she cuts out meals and sleep, she can work 25 hours a day. Gomez, darling, aren't there only 24 hours in a day? By george, you're right. She'll just have to sing faster. In three months I'll have her ready to audition. Better make it six. Morticia, that's French. - Gomez, darling, we have a guest. - Oh, pardon me. You rang? Lurch, would you please show Mr. Bellini the door. But I'm not ready to go. All right, I'm ready. I want you also to work on her tremolo. Oh, we will, we will. I'll put her on a strict diet. Darling, what an exciting six months it's been. And in a few moments, our Ophelia will be auditioning for the great impresario Rudolpho himself. That reminds me, Uncle Fester, how's Ophelia's throat spray coming? I think it needs a little splash of ammonia. The color is getting good. It is sort of a bilious fuchsia. - There, I think it's done. - Well, we'll know in a moment. - It's perfect. - Well, got to get it while it's hot. There you are. Singer's Squirt No. 5. Thank you, Uncle Fester. When we spray Ophelia's throat with this, she'll sing like she never sang before. That must be Signor Bellini and the great Rudolpho. Quick, Uncle Fester, go upstairs and spray Ophelia. Signor Bellini and impresario Rudolpho. Oh, charming, we've heard so much about you. Yes, I've heard quite a bit about you, too. And until today I didn't believe it. Let's get on with the audition. What a voice you're going to hear. Just one moment, Bellini. Impresario, Gomez Addams here. Now before we bring on the little lady, there are few details of contract to be settled. First, she's to have star billing. Star billing? But I haven't even heard her yet. Exactly, we can't take any chances. - We want to see Ophelia's name in lights. - In lights? Uncle Fester will supply the electricity. He can make it flicker. Now, as to money, salary, we're prepared to start modestly. $10,000 a week plus 90% of the gross. And, of course, free tickets for every member of the family at all performances. Get the girl and let her sing. In due time, Bellini. Just one more detail to settle. Impresario, we don't want Ophelia doing any of those tired, old operas by Wagner, Puccini, Verdi. You see, we feel that a new singer should have a new opera. Exactly, and with this in mind, my dear Morticia has composed one. It's a frothy little item entitled Afternoon In A Swamp. Bellini, if ever I get out of here alive, you won't be. Thing, may I please have the contracts? Thank you. Now, if you'll just sign the contract. Signor Gomez, I will not sign anything. Very well, a handshake is good enough. Please, humor him. Shake hands. Here comes my dear sister, Ophelia. Gentlemen, please be seated. Play, Signor Lurch. This is unbelievable. What have you done to her? Isn't he the modest one? It's all Signor Bellini's doing. All we did was spray her throat with Uncle Fester's special atomizer. You fools! You have melted the nodes on her vocal chord. Bellini, you are barred from my opera house. Even with a ticket. Impresario Rudolpho, you haven't heard my wife's opera. For that I am grateful. The prejudice against new music. At least you could hear the finale. It's truly inspiring. As the dancers glide through the quicksand, the chorus swells triumphantly. And the prima donna sings that lovely aria, Afternoon In A Swamp. Left him speechless. I knew it would get him. Hello. Ophelia Frump? Just a minute, I'll see if she That's me. Throckmorton, lover, angel, where are you? In hiding. Yes, of course. Bye, bye lover. I'm sorry. I cannot join the opera. You can't? Oh, my dear young lady, this has been a red-letter day for music. And as for An Afternoon In A Swamp, this has certainly been one. I'm sorry, Signor Bellini, but a woman must place love before her career. Forget it. I'm just going to take a long walk, against the traffic lights. What's all this about love and career? Throckmorton wants me back. He says he's sure now that we can be completely compatible. Oh, what happened? - He took up judo. - Judo? This. - How're we doing? - Perfect score, dear. You've missed 100 out of 100. The mail's in. Thank you, Thing. Gomez, darling, it's from the Canary Islands. Strange, we don't know any canaries. - Oh, it's from my sister Ophelia. - I wonder what she says. Oh, she says it was all off between her and Throckmorton - from the very first moment they met. - From the very first moment they met? He dislocated his shoulder. But she says she's happy. She's regained her two-part voice and it's lovelier than ever. - She even sent us a record. - Well, let's give it a listen. Oh, I'm falling in love By george, she's done it again. I must write to her immediately. I have a lovely idea for her next record. What, cara mia? The Sextet from Lucia. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -It's unbelievable. -Our own son. He was always such a good boy. Keeping to the basement, playing with his octopus. It's terrible. You must do something about it. After all, darling, the Addams family honor. You're right. Family honor. Thank you, Thing. It's worse than I thought. He's wearing it. I don't believe it. I want to see it with my own eyes. -We've Iost him. -Can I Iook, Mother? Certainly not. Grandmama, take her to her room. I can't stand these weird things. I'm gonna sit in my tree house and watch the Iightning. Our poor boy. Something's come over him. What are we going to do? Darling, I must have time to think. After all, this isn't some boyish prank Iike setting the house on fire. You've spoiled the boy, that's what you've done. -How? -How? Well, what other boy has a playroom Iike this? I don't see any harm in a few simple toys. You call this rack a simple toy? Why, this is Iuxury, pure Iuxury. And how about this battle-ax? It was the boy's fifth birthday, -and he was so tired of his blowgun. -Oh, fine. You know, my father wouldn't even Iet me touch one of these until I was eight. You know, I didn't become what I am by accident. I had upbringing Iike no other. Like no other. Eight years old. And how old was he when you gave him this Iittle toy? That's not Pugsley's, that's Iittle Wednesday's. Oh, Wednesday's. You're gonna spoil her, too, huh? Perhaps we have been pampering them too much. Well, there's really nothing to worry about. Oh, yes, there is. A 10-year-old boy sneaking around in a Boy Scout uniform. GOMEZ: Darling, there's something I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you. The other afternoon I saw Pugsley playing with a bat. A bat? Well, that's more Iike our boy. A baseball bat. It's a game played outdoors. In the sun. Oh, no. -You know what I think? -The boy needs help. No, tomorrow's another day. We'II bide our time. -Maybe he'II come out of it. -Perhaps you're right. We can only hope. Let's go upstairs to bed. Why, thank you, Thing. Thank heaven Thing is still normal. Come along, darling, I want to show you my new nightgown. -Do you Iike it? -Adore it. Tish, Iet's go down to the cave. That we save for special occasions, bubele. You know what you do when you call me that. Well, it just slipped out. Now control yourself, Gomez. I'II try. Let me do that. You did mine Iast night. That scent's beautiful. -Buy a barrel of it. -That's the only way it comes. Darling, I'm sorry, I just can't think of anything tonight except our poor Pugsley. I understand. Who'd ever thought we'd have a problem child? I wonder if blondes do have more fun. Watch it, Tish. Watch it! Wonderful. For a minute there I thought I was going to miss. I Iove to watch you play with these trains. It brings out the real you. It's not the same without Iittle Pugsley. He's a great train wrecker. It's a shame to see natural talent go to waste. Tish, would you Iike to see me blow up three trains? Oh, darling, you know I would. But I have to fix your Iunch. We're having your favorite, eye of newt. Broiled. Just a minute, Son. What's the hurry? I've got things to do. I gotta go. But you forgot to feed Aristotle. Gomez, have you noticed how Pugsley's been ignoring poor Aristotle Iately? Well, he does Iook a Iittle pale around the tentacles. Look at those sad eyes. I wonder where he went in such a hurry. Oh, I do hope he went to the mineshaft. The dankness does things for him. -Gomez! -What is it? He's out there playing with an it. -Maybe it's a baby armadillo. -PIease, Iet's not pretend. We all know what it is. It's a P-U-P-P-Y. Lurch. You rang? Go get Pugsley and take him to his room. I wanna have a talk with him. -He's out there playing with -I know. Well, maybe we could all Iearn to Iove the Iittle P-U-P-P-Y. Uncle Fester, go to your room. -Come with me. -I can't right now. -GOMEZ: May I come in, Son? -Just a second. I hope I'm not interrupting. No, I wasn't doing anything special. Good, I thought we'd have a chat. Maybe a Iittle difficult for you to realize, Pugsley, but I was once a boy your age. It is a Iittle hard to think of you at 10. Oh, I was a typical child. Faced with all the typical temptations. The important thing, Pugsley, is for a boy not to take a wrong turn. I'II never forget when I was a boy, I stood in front of Bailey's department store, admiring a display of gaudy uniforms, mess kits, pup tents, those fat Iittle knives. I often wondered what would have happened if I had tied that first knot. Gosh, Dad, you might have ended up as a Scoutmaster. Boy, you're sicker than I thought. Don't you realize that all he's going to grow up to be is a dog? -Oh, it went that badly, dear? -Terrible. He even called me "Dad. " Thank heaven he's never called me "Mom. " First serious talk I've had with the Iad and I botched it. -Where did we fail, Gomez? -Who knows? I have it. He's still a baby. Tonight when I tuck him in, I'II read him something nice and soothing. "Once upon a midnight dreary "While I pondered, weak and weary "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten Iore "While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping" Pugsley, darling, you're not Iistening. The Raven was always one of your favorites. You said it made you feel so nice and cozy. I Iike it all right. I've just got other things on my mind. Mother knows. She knows when her Iittle boy is upset. I'm not upset. But you are, darling, you're all flushed. Lost your Iovely pallor. Now, why don't you put all these strange thoughts out of your mind? I'II get your alligator. Oh, you poor dear. "PIumbers, proxy solicitors, -"psychologist, child. " -Morticia, must we? Darling, we need help. Dr. BIack. BIack? Well, at Ieast he sounds friendly. MORTICIA: 5432 I can see she has a real problem. It's not Mrs. Addams. -It's his problem. -It's our Pugsley. What is a Pugsley? Pugsley is our son. Oh, a child problem. I've got one of my own. No wonder you two Iook so You should see how my wife and I Iook some days. I'II never forget Just what seems to be the trouble? Well, in the first place, it's those terrible clothes he's been wearing. -Uh-huh, beatnik. -That wouldn't be bad. Really? But on top of that he's suddenly attached himself to the strangest creature. -A girl? -An animal. The retreat-to-the-forest syndrome. They all go through these things. We never did. Believe me, most parents have the same problem. Weird clothes and strange pets, all bidding for more attention. Well, give him a Iittle more. Cater to his childish whims. Cater to such outrageous behavior? And in a few days, you'II have your boy back again. Well. Thank you, Doctor. You modern psychologists certainly have a way of getting to the heart of things. We do, don't we? Yes. Oh, come here, darling. You want to see me, Mom? Yes, I always want to see you, darling. What's closer in this world than a boy and his mother? A boy and his octopus? Maybe. Would you Iike to help me feed CIeopatra? I can't, Mom. I have to go up and read. Now, now, CIeopatra. Mind your manners, darling. What is it you're reading, darling? "How to Become an Eagle Scout. " Oh, is that about an eagle who carries off a scout? Don't think so. Well, read what you please, dear. Oh, I see you have on your Iovely neckerchief. -May I try it on? -Sure. Now I have to go up and read my manual. Keep the neckerchief, Mother, I'II get another. Oh, CIeopatra, there is real tragedy in this house. Put them back, Lurch. Doctor's orders. We must cater to his every whim until this phase passes. Where did you find him? He was out in front of the house in that uniform, helping an old Iady across the street. -Aren't you gonna punish him? -GOMEZ: For what? The things kids get away with today. Pugsley, that's certainly a smart-Iooking uniform. -Mind if I try on the hat? -Gosh, no, Dad. -How do I Iook? -Sharp. Been a Iong time since you and I have had a real romp with the trains. Lately we haven't had a chance to be together much, have we? Guess not. Remember how we always used to enjoy blowing up the bridge? Today I've got dynamite under the bridge and the water tower. You do? Next time she comes around, you grab the plunger and Iet her rip. AII right, here she comes. Got the plunger? I'm sorry, Dad, I'm just not in the mood. Morticia, I failed again. -We've both failed. -We've Iost touch with him. Maybe we were thoughtless. That summer we were too busy to go into the bat cave with him. Now he throws balls at them. Dr. BIack, I'm just afraid it's an emergency. You're going to have to come over. But we did do as you suggested. We have catered to his whims. We have paid attention to him. But it just doesn't do any good. You have no idea the strange things he's been bringing into this house. You're just going to have to come over. Dr. BIack, I'm so glad you're here. We've been at our wits' end over our Pugsley. Just Iook at this mess. I can see your problem. Isn't this sickening? Ghastly. You told us to cater to him. Well, this is the result. Horrible. I guess I am partly to blame, but I think you went a Iittle too far. Much too far. As a matter of fact, this is the most extreme case of over-catering I've ever seen. Dr. BIack, this is Pugsley's uncle, Fester. How do youdo? I see you've been catering to the boy, too. And how. Excuse me, those things you're carrying I'm taking them up to Pugsley's room. Aren't they dangerously Iarge firecrackers for a boy? Oh, they're not firecrackers, they're dynamite. Mrs. Addams, I know I'm responsible for what's going on here, but I'm afraid things have gotten too far out of hand. I better take over. I think I'II go up and have a talk with the boy. Very well. It's the door at the head of the stairs, the one with the baby vultures painted on it. Come on, Pugsley, Iet's have a blast, just for old times' sake, huh? Who is it? BLACK: It's Dr. BIack, sonny. Your mommy asked me to have a Iittle chat with you. Come in, sir. I think you've done more than your part. I'II take it from here. Good Iuck. You really Iike the way your Uncle Fester Iooks? Oh, sure. He Iooks fine. I can see we're going to have to have quite a chat. -What's going on? -He's up there. -With Pugsley? -Yes. Oh, dear. Maybe we shouldn't have taken his ax away when he was a baby. He seemed so happy chopping up things. And it was good exercise. Wish I knew what was going on up there. -I'II climb up and take a Iook. -Excellent idea. And then we took the rope and we put it around and around -How's it going? -Oh, great. You know, that doctor's a Iot smarter than he Iooks. Thank heaven. Pugsley's past the crisis. -Doctor, is everything all right? -Naturally. AII that had to be done was to release the boy's inner antagonisms. See, Morticia? Pugsley's come through. Magnificently. Once again, he's the wonderful boy you both Ioved. Oh, thank heaven. Now I can get rid of all this ridiculous mess. By all means do. Get your house back to normal. -Thank you so much, Doctor. -Goodbye, Mrs. Addams. Goodbye. You uncles. You pamper the children worse than the parents do. Here's a surprise. It says Dr. BIack has quit. -Quit? Why? -Going back to school. I think we should send him a present. The turtle. -Something better than that. -Better than the turtle? After all, he did give us our boy back. 
Thank you, thank you. And thank you, Lurch. And, Lurch, would you mind taking the children up to the tower? Mama's waiting for them. She wants to play pinochle. Oh, goody. - Wasn't Morticia marvelous, Cousin Itt? - He's asleep, dear. - How can you tell? - I can hear him snoring. Come. We've entertained some pretty cold audiences. But at least they didn't fall asleep. They had the decency to walk out. Poor Cousin Itt is troubled, darling. He hasn't been sleeping well lately. I think he has a problem. Problem? But he's got everything. A brilliant mind, a charming personality. And he's a great dresser. That's true. But he can't seem to find a place for himself. A career that would do him justice. Cousin Itt would make a great undercover agent. - Special Agent 298. - No. Darling, Cousin Itt is probably bored by beautiful women. Let's wake him up. Cousin Itt. Oh, I'm sorry, dear, I didn't mean to interrupt your dream. Something exciting, old man? That is exciting. Zooming through the air in one of those jets. Dreaming you were the pilot, eh? - The stewardess? - He is mixed up. Of course, dear. Go to your room and finish your dream. Tell us how it comes out. Darling, we must think of a way to help Cousin Itt. We'd better. He's threatening to go to the South Seas and become a beachcomber. We can't let that happen. He'd never get the sand out of his hair. But we simply can't let a fine human being like that think he's a failure. Might drive him into doing something rash. Darling, what about music? He could become a rock and roll singer. Nobody would understand a word he was saying. No, Cousin Itt's a longhair. Well, then, what about the violin? He could even make his own bows. But I'd miss him so when he goes on those long concert tours. Oh, he is a lovable little rascal. Such a brilliant conversationalist. Voilá! I have it. Tish, that's French. Darling, please. Let me tell you my idea. - Let me tell you mine. - Later, dear, later. - Right now I want to talk about Cousin Itt. - Yes, where were we? I have the perfect career for Cousin Itt. - Marriage counselor. - Isn't he a bit inexperienced? So is the hangman till his first job. The hangman. Perhaps No, Itt's more the marriage counselor type. That's true. You rang? Yes. Lurch, please go wake up Cousin Itt. He's embarking on a new career, marriage counselor. You see. We're on the right track. Darling. A stewardess? Sorry. Downstairs to discuss your future. A stewardess. Why, marriage counseling should be right up your alley. Nonsense, you're the perfect type. Oh, no, Itt. You have to be a girl to be a stewardess. It is not unfair. That's just the way things are. Besides, I'll prove to you that you'd be a good marriage counselor. Gomez and I will pretend to be a married couple with a problem. And we'll come to you for counseling. Far-fetched, but we'll go though with the charade. Will you do it, Itt? Good. Inside you're all heart. Quite a combination. Inside all heart. Outside all hair. Cousin Itt, step down to the desk, please. Right this way. Here we are. Maybe we should put a telephone book under him. No. I think he should look at these problems from his own viewpoint. Right. All right, Doctor, you're open for business. Good afternoon, Dr. Itt. We're a young married couple and we have a problem. What do you mean you're too busy to see us? We need help. Henry. Henry and I have been married for three days and already he isn't paying any attention to me. Well, no wonder, you haven't been out of hair curlers since the ceremony. Why should I? All you ever do is look at that silly newspaper. I don't just look at the paper. I study the stock market. That's a laugh. You study the stock market and you don't have a penny to your name. No wonder I don't have a penny. You spend it before I earn it. Tish, when you laugh it drives me wild. Darling, please. We're two other people. Oh, yes. My mother always told me you were a tightwad. I'll tell you how much I give her. Plus carfare. She's nothing but a spendthrift. And I mean it. Do you, Gomez, really? Of course not. There was something in your voice. Maybe way down deep inside you do think I'm wasteful. - Oh, Gomez. - Tish When you cry, it sets my whole being aflame. No. You just think I'm a plaything. And a delightful one, eh, Itt? Right, right. One man's meat is another man's poison! That does it. I didn't say it. Itt did. - I'm going to my room. - I'll go with you. No, thank you, I'd rather be alone. I'm going to finish reading War and Peace. - What page are you on? - Twelve. Bigmouth. It's Gomez. Passionflower. What will Mama and the children think? Let me in. Morticia, everyone's in bed except me. Fine thing. Just 'cause you two have a little spat us innocents have to suffer. I'm sorry, Uncle Fester. But my sensibilities have been wounded. Nonsense, Cousin Itt. It isn't your fault because Mr. Addams let his temper run away with him. Me? Loving father and tender husband? Temper? I give up. Morticia! That French again. Forgive me, cara mia. I've been a cad and a fool. No, darling. Just a cad. I've been a fool. Sending you out in your bare feet without a thought of your sinuses. You're right. We'd better get out of here before this thing gets out of hand. Querida, let's fly away together. A second honeymoon. Darling, we've already had a second honeymoon. Then we'll have a third, a fourth and a fifth. Darling, we must think about Cousin Itt. Oh, yes. Where were we? Obviously being a marriage counselor isn't his cup of tea. Perhaps his cup of tea is failure. That's what they used to say about old Cornelius Addams. And they were right. But not about Cousin Itt. He's different. So he is. What can we do? What do we always do when we have an insurmountable problem? - Give up. - Not always. - This time we'll call an expert. - An expert. Where can we find one? - In the phone book. - Good thinking. Thing? There we are. "Vampires. Vikings. Vocational guidance. " Thank you, Thing. Here's one. Mortimer Phelps. Oh, I remember him. He's the one that helped Cousin Trivia get a career after she got out of the wax. - WACs? The army? - The museum. But does he really know about jobs? How to make good at them? He should. He had hundreds before he became a vocational expert. Sounds like our man. I I Goodbye. On second thought, I'll stay. Follow me. Careful, that's imported feathers. Mr. Phelps. Mr. Phelps. Addams here. This is Mrs. Addams. Good of you to rush over. You said it was an emergency. We didn't really expect you to have to stay the night, though. These are merely the tools of my trade. Nowadays vocational guidance is an exact science. Oh, good. Then you won't have any trouble finding the exact position for Cousin Itt. Cousin Itt? From whose side of the family? He's from both sides of the family. He hasn't quite found himself. And with Cousin Itt that's not easy. He looks the same from every angle. Well, that's the kind of a challenge I like. In my profession we have one motto, "There's a place for everybody. " - What was that? - That's Cousin Itt. I know. You're wondering why such an attractive young man would have any trouble finding employment. Now, obviously he'd be no good at basketball. He hasn't got the stamina. Darling, we mustn't prejudice Mr. Phelps. Let him make up his own mind. But just on a first impression, where would you say that Cousin Itt belongs? In a mattress. You don't need a vocational counselor, what you need is a veterinarian. No, I don't think that would do. Cousin Itt doesn't like animal husbandry. Don't rush off, old man. Remember your motto, "A place for everyone. " Everyone, not everything. This project's impossible. - There isn't enough time or money. - Money is no object. Money is Well, then, let's Let's try. Send him in. Good. Cousin Itt, darling, come here. Someone wants to meet you. - Is he human? - To a fault. He'd give you the hair right off his back. Now first we'll try the perception and coordination test. Now, the object is to get these blocks together as quickly as possible. Looks simple. No, darling, I don't think that's really quite I think this is the way it goes. Oh, dear, why don't they give instructions with these things? Would you mind letting the subject try it? Not at all. No, Cousin Itt. It is not a game. Would you mind doing that again slowly? I've never been able to get these things together. It's amazing, isn't it? So that's how it's done. Yellow one goes Well, let's try something a little more advanced, the Rorschach tests. By george, I've seen that somewhere before. Well, of course, they're the Rorschach inkblots. I have it. Morticia's inkblot. That Rorschach did have a touch. Please? Now tell me what you see. That's obvious, it's the ancient fertility dance. - Gomez. - Modern fertility dance? They're not dancing. By george, you're right. It's a bathtub. Please. We're trying to test Cousin Itt. Now what do you see? A bunch of bananas? Oh, the poor dear. The poor dear is right. That's what Rorschach says it is. I still say it's a bathtub. Now think carefully. What is this? He says it's a slaughterhouse in Chicago. Robins singing? Sunrise over Phoenix? Moon over Miami? Why, it's amazing. He got every one of them right. Now let's test his imagination. Now, I'll say a word, and you say whatever word pops into your mind. - Bird. - Vulture. - Molting. - Mating. - Nesting. - Billing. - Cooing. - Lips. - Red. - Kiss me. Please! I will not tolerate any more interruptions. Really, old man, you don't understand true love when you see it. Darling Gomez, Mr. Phelps is right. Itt now. Us later. Thank you. Now if we're all ready Black. - Love. - Frustrated. Mr. Addams, please let the young man answer for himself. Love. Dry. Good glory, I can understand him. Of course. All you have to do is get used to his accent. Look at the two of them, chatting away in perfect understanding. It's heartening, isn't it? Perhaps the United Nations will work. How long has Phelps been in there? Oh, he's been evaluating that data for over three hours now. - This is nerve-wracking. - I can't stand it. Poor Cousin Itt. He's so nervous, he went up in the tree house with Uncle Fester. I hope a passing eagle doesn't snatch him up. Oh, dear, he would make good nesting material, wouldn't he? How long's this gonna take? Cousin Itt's getting so nervous he's starting to stutter. Patience. You can't hurry science. After all, Madame Curie didn't invent the cotton gin in minutes. - Friends - Well, old man, what's the verdict? Only once in a lifetime does a case like this come along. Now, you may not realize it, but Cousin Itt is no ordinary person. Of course not. He's got an IQ of 320, and that's without his shoes on. This young man could be a nuclear physicist, an outstanding general, a brilliant surgeon. Wonderful idea. He could operate without stooping. Once he got you open he could look right in. But there is always the one perfect career. And for Cousin Itt, with his great compassion and sense of human understanding, that one perfect career is marriage counselor. You rang? Lurch, show this quack the door. Yes, Mr. Addams. Morticia, we'll have to stop calling in these incompetent experts. You're so right, darling. I don't know how he ever got in the phone book. Oh, but that's a marvelous idea. - Going to the South Sea Islands to paint. - Of course, all Itt'll have to do is jump in the paint bucket and roll around on the canvas. Very colorful. Both his work and he. Rather careless of old Phelps to leave his testing blocks behind. - He did seem to be in a hurry, didn't he? - Yes. Well, I think I've got it down pat now. - Give me a fast count to 10 and I'll try it. - All right, dear. - One, two, three - That's it, got it. Are you sure? It looks a little different. So it does. Well, poor Cousin Itt must have gotten it wrong. Now I'll count and you try it. No, darling. One genius in the family is enough. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. - It's from Cousin Itt in Pango Pango. - How's he getting along? Beautifully. He's the official tourist guide, showing the people the interesting sights. As a matter of fact, he's become the most interesting sight himself. He certainly must have won a place in their hearts. They have his picture on a postage stamp. Dear Cousin Itt. Someday he'll become a collector's item. - He is already. - Mommy, Daddy. - Yes, Wednesday, what is it, darling? - May I play with the blocks? Well, of course, dear. Here, help yourself. - I think that's a little closer to it. - Really? Gomez, darling, don't be jealous. There is room in the family for one and a half geniuses. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Didn't know Pugsley was home from school so early. He's certainly getting a lot out of that little atomic reactor you bought him. Mother, Father. Thank you, darling. My son, who's minding the reactor upstairs? I gave that to Wednesday. All that kid stuff is behind me now. What I really want is Don't stop. After all, we feel towards you as if you were our own son. Gomez, he is! I thought he looked familiar. All right now, out with it, boy. I need some money. Oh, is that all? Well, I think the boy is entitled to an allowance, dear. How about 100 a week? $100 a week for a boy of ten? You're right, we'll make it 200. But, Mother, you don't understand. I want to work. Work! Watch your language, boy. We Addamses haven't worked in 300 years. Supervise or manage, yes, but work, never. Pugsley! You'd be the laughingstock of the entire family. But, Mother, I'm not joking. - I want to go to - Stop! We've heard quite enough, young man. March right upstairs to your room. - But, Mother - No buts. Oh, where, Gomez? Where have we failed that boy? I know he said work, but maybe it was just a slip of the tongue. No, he meant it. Well, the boy's been into that library, sneaking out those Horatio Alger books. - Not only that, he's been reading. - Well, now. Well, I wasn't allowed to even touch Horatio Alger until I was 28. A brainwashing like that could ruin a child's character. Well, are you two ready? - Ready! - Ready! Right, go! Sure tickles. Obviously, Pugsley took a wrong turn. I certainly don't understand it. Boy's had a proper upbringing. We gave him all the dynamite he could ever want. That blade is cold. He certainly had good pets. Aristotle, loving octopus. And a cheerful little spider like Homer. Fester! How do you do it? Very simple. You two have just got bad aim. Well, what are we gonna do about Pugsley? Darling, I was thinking. Why don't we let him earn some money? Might teach him a lesson. Let's not get carried away. What is he going to do with the money? He wants to buy a jet-powered motor scooter with interchangeable hubcaps. Oh, well. Certainly nothing wrong with that. Is there? - You rang? - Gadzooks, Lurch. Here before I ring. That's what I call efficiency. Have you seen Pugsley? On the roof. - What's he doing up there? - Testing his parachute. So that's where my silk chemise went. Chemise Tish French. Pugsley. We've come to a decision. We've decided, no matter how bizarre it may seem, we're going to let you go to work. Whoopee! Now, Pugsley. You've been taught to watch your language. Naturally, you'll need a job in keeping with your heritage and social status. I have it, a shipping magnate. You like shipping, dear? Last time I was on a ship, I got sick. Better idea, astronaut. I don't think so, dear. If he got sick on a boat, imagine what would happen up in that capsule. If you don't mind, I'd like to find my own job. Reminds me of Cousin Goop. There was a fellow who really knew how to look for a job. Never found one. You know, darling, the last time I tied you up like this, it took you three weeks to escape. Great sport. Dr. Bird. Oh, I didn't know anyone was sick in this house. - I'm not sick. Are you sick, Gomez? - Never felt better. I'm afraid you have the wrong house. I'm sure I have the right house. This boy must belong to you. Of course he does. - Is he sick? - No. I'm sick! - Why don't you see a doctor? - I am a doctor! But he's not! Well, of course not. Pugsley won't even be ready for medical school for a year or two. At least! But in the meantime, I'll thank you to keep that meddling little menace out of my operating room! But I was only looking for a job. Surely you don't object to the lad seeking honest employment? Oh, no. Not at all. What I object to is him coming right in, in the middle of an appendectomy, wielding a scalpel! I'm sure he was only trying to help. Don't you have an apprentice program, like the plumbers and carpenters? Mr. Addams, I'm sure you don't realize that operations require the utmost delicacy and finesse. Yes. Perhaps surgery is a bit too advanced for Pugsley. But I'm sure he could give a marvelous anesthesia. If your boy wants to get into my hospital, any part of my hospital, he'll have to require medical help, not give it! Well, so much for medicine. Don't you worry, darling. - Those menial jobs aren't for you. - Of course not. Pugsley, if you're bound to work, I'll let you manage my mango plantation. Now, it's in Brazil. We'd miss you. No, I said I was going to find my own job, and I'm going to. The lad has determination. All right, querida. Count up to ten. You ready? One. Two. Three. Four. Oh, I forgot to tell Pugsley, I heard of a vacancy in Harvard Five. Six. Seven. - In the bank vault? - That's where we found him. Right between the 50s and the 100s. I was only counting them. That's very good, Pugsley, darling, you weren't wasting your time on 5s and 10s. Mrs. Addams. It is not the policy of the First National Bank to start our trainees off in the vault. And what bothers me is how he got in there in the first place. Oh, I think I can explain that. - He dug a tunnel. - A tunnel? Yes, he's always digging tunnels. Aren't you, Pugsley, darling? I had to. You kept throwing me out of your office. Is that true, Mr. Glenville? Mr. Addams will hear about this. Gomez! Right here, Morticia. Heard the whole thing. Your apology is in order, Glenville. My apology? Your son's been pestering me for a job. That's hardly cause for violence. - The job he wanted was vice president. - What's wrong with that? - I'm vice president! - Oh. Well, we wouldn't want you to lose your job. How about making Pugsley president? You people must be out of your minds. You rang? On second thought, maybe it's my mind. Lurch, Mr. Glenville has been behaving rather badly. Follow me. Well, there goes banking. Banking really isn't very dependable. Have you noticed how they keep switching those interest rates? Well, Pugsley, you're still welcome to go into business with me. We'd call it Addams and Son. - What would we do? - Do? Isn't it enough that we'd be together? I'd teach you how to be an escape artist. I think I better go out and look some more. Chip off the old block. - Well, back to the counting. - Yes, darling. Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two. Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three. Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-four. Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five Master Pugsley and Bennie, the bookie. Forgive me, Mr. Bennie, I'm a little tied up at the moment. My lovely wife, Morticia. - Figures. - A bookie Mr. Bennie, are you in the publishing business? Are you putting me on, lady? The only thing I publish is a tip sheet. And I don't want any punk like this moving in on me. All I was doing was answering the phone for him. By the time I caught him, I lost a bundle at Hialeah. Pugsley! You don't mean to say you were looking for a position in a racing parlor? I thought it was a funeral parlor. That's what it said in the window. Well, that's just to fool the local fuzz. If they ever find out what I'm doing, it'll be my funeral. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to use your phone. Let the boys know I'm on my way back. By all means, Mr. Bennie. Pugsley, darling, I'm glad you didn't take a position with that man. - He's much too high-strung. - Must be the tax situation. - Paying them? - Avoiding them. Pugsley, why don't you give up job hunting and take an allowance? I wanna work for my money. That boy's fallen in with the wrong crowd. Nonsense, darling. The only child he's been playing with is our own daughter, Wednesday. Tish, I spoke French. Nothing like a joust with the foils after a big lunch. I hardly ate a bite. Pugsley's been gone all afternoon and I'm so worried. So am I. He may have found a job. He wants us to look out the window. Thank you, Thing. By george! There's Pugsley and Wednesday, talking to the Hensons. Querida. Oh, wouldn't you know it. They're doing their usual captivating job. The little rascals, who can resist them? - A job? - I'll do anything. And I'll be his assistant. She's paying me a quarter to do that. Oh, I see. Well, what would you charge me to trim the hedge, wash my car, and clean out the attic? - A quarter? - A half a dollar. Oh, all right. - A half a dollar. - It's a deal. Good. Now, Mrs. Henson and I will be away for the rest of the day. We'll see you when we get back. But, remember, I want to get rid of everything in that attic. - Everything? - Everything, down to the last cobweb. - And my car. - Yes, sir. - I want it cleaned, inside and out. - Yes, sir. And don't forget to trim the hedge. Trim, trim, trim. - We will, sir. - Thank you, sir. Arthur. Don't you think you could have given them Nonsense, my dear. Those kids get gypped a few times, it sharpens them up. Why, people like me are benefactors to those children. Yes, I'm a little nervous about those Addams kids. Oh, what's the difference? Why, he looks strong as an ox and she probably is very wiry. Oh, well, you'd hire Jack the Ripper and Lizzie Borden if they worked cheap enough. I know what I'm doing. If I really get that attic cleaned out and this hedge trimmed, I can unload this lemon. Come on, Charity, we gotta go. We gotta foreclose on that Smith place before 3:00. Thank you, Thing. Hello. - Oh, darling, it's you. - Who you calling "darling"? Your son, Pugsley. Yes, darling. Really? Oh, that's wonderful! Yes, goodbye, dear. Pugsley has a position with Mr. Henson. And Wednesday is assisting. Henson's a big man in property management. I suppose they'll have to start at the bottom. No, at the top. They're cleaning out Mr. Henson's attic. Little scamps don't waste much time getting going. With their deft way with blasting caps, they'll have that attic cleaned out before you can say, "Take cover. " My dear, it took me years to acquire the proficiency of the Australian Aborigine with the boomerang. So don't be too disappointed at the showing you first make. All right, now try it, my dear. - Yes, that's it. - Like this, dear? Yes, indeed. Not bad for a beginner! Now, the essential quality of the boomerang is that - It returns to its thrower. - Correct. As a matter of fact, a real expert can make it return Again and again. Wonderful! Seven more years of lovely luck. - Hi! - Hi! - Hi! - My little working force. Home from the first day on the job. What did the Hensons think of your work? They didn't get back yet. But it's all done. Wonderful! Trust an Addams to finish the job. Finish the job? They're the first Addamses who've ever had one! I'll get that. Thank you, Thing. Hello? Yes, Mr. Henson. How delightful to hear from you again. Well, of course we can come right over. We'll be there in a few moments. Probably want to show us the children's great work. He seemed very excited about something. Excited? Of course, I'm excited! Look what those kids of yours did to my hedge! Oh! Oh, well, I don't blame you for being excited about that. That's sheer artistry. All I said was trim it. Trim, trim, trim. Mr. Henson. Anyone can trim a hedge. It takes imagination to shape it. All that wonderful talent in those pudgy little hands. Well, let me show you something else those pudgy little hands did! I told them to clean the car, inside and out. Sounds fair enough. This way? By george, I wish I'd thought of that. Lurch just shakes our car out. It's soaked! You lucky man. Stock it with trout, you won't even have to leave the garage to go fishing. Dear Pugsley. He's so original. I can't wait to see how they handled the attic. Oh, they did a real bang-up job on the attic. Look there! All I asked them to do was to clean out the attic and get rid of everything. Well, they certainly cleaned it out. There isn't a trace of anything. I'm gonna have to rebuild that whole east wing. And I assure you, sir, I'm gonna sue you for every dime's worth of damage that fat little demon of yours caused. Gomez. Is he talking about Pugsley? I guess so. Although I never thought of him as a demon. Mr. Henson! I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to apologize. Apologize? I'm calling my lawyers immediately. In that case, Henson, I am going to have to countersue. You! Sue me for what? Henson, you're running an illegal sweatshop. Sweatshop! There are still child-labor laws in this country, Henson. You could be in a lot of trouble. Come along, my dear. I'm going home to prepare my case. Mr. Henson. I want you to know that Wednesday and Pugsley will never have my permission to work for you again. We, therefore, hold that the deponent is guilty as charged of violating due process and illegally using little children. Getting all that, Thing? Now, we could use a nice, resounding legal phrase right here. Habeas corpus? - Nolo contendere? - Tish. - That's French! - It's Latin. Oh. Type that up right away, will you, Thing? Lurch! What's the meaning of this? - Found him. - Found him? Lurking on the porch. - I - Put Mr. Henson in the good chair, Lurch. I was not lurking! I was just trying to get up enough nerve to ring the bell. I'm not surprised, after the way you've behaved. Is there something you wanted to tell us, Mr. Henson? Like pleading guilty? I warn you, Henson, anything you say may be held against you. Look, my wife and I have talked this over. We don't want to go to court. - I'm on the verge of bankruptcy now. - Oh. Well, if you're a little short, perhaps we could go to small claims court? I don't want to go to any court. I don't want any more trouble. All I want is a new attic, a dry car, and a little handful of hedge seed. That doesn't seem like he's asking for too much, darling. Let's get one thing straight, Henson. - You do admit your guilt in this case? - Oh, I You do admit our boy did exactly what you asked him to do? I admit it. I admit it. And you're sorry? Oh, I am sorry. Believe me. I'm sorry I ever saw that boy of yours. All I wanted was to get my attic cleaned out, my hedge trimmed, so I could sell the place. Well, the attic couldn't have been cleaned out any cleaner. Or the hedge trimmed any prettier. So it's a deal. You wanna buy the place? Mr. Addams can't resist a clean attic and a shapely hedge. Well, I was going to ask $20,000 for the place. - 25,000, not a penny less. - Sold! Sold! All right. 5, Here's 5 to grow on. Thank you. Oh, you sweet, generous, lovely people. - Hi, Mr. Henson. - Hi, Mr. Henson. You lovely, wonderful children. Oh, I don't know how to thank you. Oh, thank you, Mrs. Addams. And thank you, Mr. Addams. And thank you, sir - Little unstable, wouldn't you say? - Yes. Well, darlings. I must admit your first job was a smashing success. - See you. - Where're you going? We're going to put in for unemployment. And social security. Don't you think you're rushing things a bit? Your mother is absolutely right. It'll have to wait until tomorrow. Sayonara, Tokyo Wonderful. Terrible. Wonderful. Terrible. Wonderful. Terrible. Darling, what's wonderful? Consolidated Fuzz just went up 47 points. - What's terrible? - I don't own any. Oh. Who's that? My dear, the greatest asset in business is manpower. Now, obviously, Pugsley and Wednesday are very valuable manpower. So I've put them to work in our own attic. Very clever, darling. And very economical, too. We'll never again have to clean that Louis XIV chandelier. Sayonara 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Querida mía. Such grace, such beauty. For you I die happily. MORTICIA: Uncle Fester doesn't seem to be very much impressed. Same old humdrum. Nothing new ever happens around here. Oh, come, Uncle Fester. Cousin Nanook sent us that lovely new totem pole for Christmas. And he asked for our bear in return. He's a real Eskimo giver. Would you like to take the vulture for a little stroll? - She seems to take to humans. - Her favorite food. I think I need a change. A trip, maybe. Oh, I think that's a very good idea. Don't you, Gomez? I do indeed. It's been a long time since we've had a family outing. Will you ever forget the fun we had on that picnic? What a lovely spot for a picnic. Devil's Island. There must be some How about the tar pits? Now, Uncle Fester, every time we go near those tar pits, you go wild. It is a fun place, isn't it? What's new? What is new? I suppose Death Valley has been overrun with tourists since we first discovered it. Yes, darling. Listen, why don't we go to Quanta La Gustra? Quanta La Gustra? Darling, that's the innkeeper's name. Oh? Oh, how disappointing. It did sound romantic. It's a problem. We've been most everywhere. We've never been to the moon. That's true, we haven't. It would be beguiling to be on the moon with you, cara mia. Especially if we landed on the dark side. Darling. But isn't that a bit far to go for a holiday trip? Well, we wouldn't run into the same old faces. That's true. - It could be rather costly. - All we need is a spaceship. We could go to the playroom and find out to the penny. All we have to do is consult the computer that Pugsley and I built. Yeah, Wizzo knows everything. Even told me how to cure my baldness. - Is it working? - No, but it cured my cough. Darling, shall we? It's such a comfort to have a machine do our thinking for us. Wizzo is a highly scientific instrument, Uncle Fester. It deals in facts. You have to feed it specific, accurate data. Like this. End result desired. Cost of manned flight to the moon. Elements. GOMEZ: Load. Thrust. Orbit. Act achieved. Plus. Well expected. Ampersand. Tuner. Silencer cap. - What's he saying? - Wizzo only knows, dear. That horn stopper. Half mile prep ratio. Mark up. "S. " Plus. Seeing to the launching pad. And coffee to your milk in-flight. It goes double first cabin all the way. - Hey, it's gonna blow up! - No, no, dear. Wizzo's just thinking. He sure thinks loud. The computer is carefully digesting all pertinent data. That's the sound of success. Our answer on the cost of rocketing to the moon will soon be here. Thank you, dear. Knows its manners. Darling, this isn't too expensive. It's just $21. 13 over a billion. It's a shade more than I expected. Oh, I'll do my part. I'll come up with the $21. 13. As a matter of fact, I don't even know how much I have on hand right now. Since I put all my finances in Mr. Hulen's hands, he's been handling everything. A vacation trip to the moon? Oh, it does sound enchanting, doesn't it? I can hardly wait to capture it all on canvas. How do you like my moon hat? Wait till Hedda Hopper gets a load of this. - Well, it's all settled. - No, it is not settled. Do you realize what it would cost to send a spaceship to the moon? Well, of course. We don't just jump into these things, you know. Here is a feature story in today's paper about the cost to our country of their space program. Read it. Wow! "Daily double pays $17,000. " No, no, not that. This. Read it. It's there in black and white. Billions! Oh dear, perhaps we are being a bit extravagant. You may be right, querida. Well, we can do without the limousine and the forensicaffer. - What's a forensicaffer, dear? - Who knows? Hey. Did you know Little Orphan Annie's got no eyeballs? That's part of her charm. Will you please stick to the issue? All this moon talk is absolutely absurd. Now hold on there, Mr. Hulen. My own personal computer claims that a trip to the moon would cost only one billion, Yeah, and I'm putting up the $21. 13. He just insists on doing his share. Oh, well, that's just dandy. But you're a trifle short on that billion. - What's a trifle? - This happens to be a very big trifle. There must be some way to pick up that kind of money. I've got it. We'll invent something that costs a dime to make, sells for a dollar, and is habit-forming. No, I don't think so, dear. Habit-forming is a bad habit. Well, now we're getting somewhere. If you get any other bright schemes - Hey, wait a minute. - Please, please. I've had a very trying day. Now look, that daily double thing paid $17,000 on only two winning horses. Nice yield. Now, what will happen if we pick eight winners every day, for, say, a whole month? How much would that be? - Way over a billion. - Over? Good. Then you wouldn't need my $21. 13. Will you please forget this moon business? I tell you, it's impractical, imprudent and absolutely impossible. Mr. Hulen, are you trying to discourage us? I certainly am. Don't beat around the bush. Just answer yes or no. Look, it's tough enough to hit a daily double. To pick eight winners in a row is almost impossible. But to pick them for 30 days is utterly preposterous. - Are you sure? - Positive. What a challenge. Dear Gomez, he has an absolute flair for failure. Well, he's a cinch. Nobody could even begin to pick that many winners. - Wizzo could. - Why, of course. Wizzo. Why, he could do it with 20 watts tied behind his back. We could put the money to wonderful use. Build a haven for Ionely and unwanted bats. Help preserve our beautiful swamplands. Endow a University chair in witchcraft and other fine arts. That's all very uplifting, of course. But it's still gambling. This is no time for negativism, old boy. As soon as Wizzo picks the right horses, you'll get out to the track and start the ball rolling. You couldn't catch me putting $2 on any horse anytime. $2? That's buzzardfeed. How about $2,000? As a starter. $2,000? In other words, darling, you take the money that we win on the first race and then bet it on the second. Is that the plan, dear? - Exactly. - Very clever, mon cher. Oh, Tish, that French. It goes right through me. - Speak some more. - Darling, we have company. Just a few words. Soup du jour. Inky dinky parlez- vous. Moulin Rouge. Anything. Very well, darling. L 'amour, toujours I'amour. Thank you, Tish. That was beautiful. Now where were we? - We were winning a lot of money. - Oh, yes! We bet with Wizzo, and one month hence we'll have an extra billion to knick and knack around with. Let's see. I seem to recall having an extra couple of thousand to bet with kicking around here somewhere. Yes. Thank you, Thing. Here we are, Mr. Hulen. $2,000. Not only cold cash but a little moldy, too. Well, you seem quite intent upon following through with this madness. Nevertheless, I would like to leave you with these few words, "Gambling is the disease of barbarians. " Shakespeare. "It's the vice of knaves and fools. " Benjamin Franklin. And, "This whole scheme is absolutely nutty. " Ralph J. Hulen. What a scholar. How fortunate to have him as our investment counselor. And bookie. Darling, a glove for Thing. No, dear. It's a sweater for Pugsley's octopus. Yes, sir. Oh, Mr. Hulen, you just missed a call from Mr. Addams. That is the best thing that's happened all day. With a list of the horses a Mr. Wizzo seems to have picked. So, since you'll be at the track all day, I'll just Their money is going to stay right in my pocket. And when that first horse loses, they're going to be grateful to me that I didn't throw it away. - But Mr. Hulen, the first four races - This firm does not gamble. We're a sound, conservative investment institution. Yes, Mr. Hulen. But, sir, perhaps you'd better just check the races on the radio. Just to be sure. - It's a waste of time. - Please, Mr. Hulen. All right. The fifth race should be on. They've picked Nellie Bee. ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: It was a driving finish, and the winner is Nellie Bee with English Gal second in the race. That's five straight. - Five straight? - Oh, yes. If you'd thrown away their money, they'd now be winning $480,000. Give me an aspirin. Kind of felt you'd be asking for one. If Wise Guy wins the next race, we'll owe them $2,850,000. - Who asked you? - But Well, I'll just have to go to the Addamses, apologize, and then tell them I didn't place their bets. What if they won't accept your apology? What if they demand their money? - What then? - Simple. I'll shoot myself. ANNOUNCER: Coming down to the line of finish now, it's Oh For The Boy and Fleet O' Foot. FESTER: Come on, Fleet O' Foot. Fleet O' Foot is going to the front by a head. Now a neck, and it's Fleet O' Foot, the winner by a furlong. He did it. Good old Fleet O' Foot! I I need a drink. - Isn't this marvelous? - How much have we won? Prices on the sixth race. Fleet O' Foot paid $6 to win, $4. 40 to place. and $2. 80 to show. That means we now have Mr. Hulen! You look really happy for us. Mr. Hulen, just think, we've already won over $7 million. There must be some mistake. Oh? You were right, Mr. Hulen, there was a mistake. Yes. Hey, aren't you supposed to be out on the track placing bets for us? Uncle Fester, important men like Mr. Hulen don't go running errands at the track. That's for the staff. Right, Mr. Hulen? Oh, yes. Yeah. Oh, well, that brings up an interesting thought. Now let's suppose, this is a hypothetical case of course, but let's suppose that your investment counselor hadn't placed any bets? Hadn't placed any bets? Where's my gun? - I'd shoot him in the back. - Now, now, Uncle Fester. This is an imaginary situation. Isn't that right, Mr. Hulen? Yes, of course. But what would you do? Since gambling bets aren't enforceable by law Never mind about that. I'd shoot him in the back. - Wouldn't that be rather drastic? - For betrayal of trust? Violation of professional ethics? Shooting in the back would be too good for him. No, I think it'd be about right. - What do you think, Mr. Hulen? - I think it's a little warm in here. - Mr. Hulen, you need a drink. - Yes No, no! You know, I think all of this talk of gambling has upset Mr. Hulen. And I don't blame him. - There's something evil about it. - Yes, it's just terrible. I think for his sake we ought to stop gambling, Gomez. You may be right, querida. All right, Mr. Hulen, we're taking your advice. - From now on, no more betting. - Oh, thank heaven. Now, if you'll just hand over the $8 million. - $8 million? - Well, you can keep the change. You know, you were right, Gomez. Especially after I read what The Handicapper says about our horse. Granny's Lover. 100 to 1. "Fell down, starting gate, Memorial Day. "Pulled up lame last time out. A real dog. " You know, we could have blown our whole bankroll. Mr. Hulen, it was very lucky that you came along when you did. - Lucky? For whom? - For us, old boy. And I can tell by your expression that that's all you really care about. Such loyalty. Hits you right here. Okay, eight million bucks. It's locked in my safe at the office. We'll go down with you. We can start handing some of it out on the way back. Well, could you hand some of it out to me now? Why, of course we could, Mr. Hulen. How much would you like? $8 million. Mr. Hulen, have you been gambling? A hypocrite. I still think betting is wrong. Especially a dog who hasn't won a race for four years. It'd be like throwing the money away. That's right. But you can't quit now. You're on a winning streak. Mr. Hulen, how can you say things like that? Easy, remember? I'm a hypocrite. - Oh, yes. - But this horse is lame. Excuses. Excuses. Well, that's just a dodge to drive the price up. Are you sure you're not a tout? - Where's the old Addams spirit? - Right in your safe. With that $8 million. You can't back out now, it would be immoral. Mr. Hulen, you're very kind to be concerned about us. But we can see how all this is upsetting you. You were quite right when you said, "Gambling is a disease of barbarians. " Well, I didn't say that. Shakespeare said it. You quoted him. Well, you know me. Big mouth. And what about your dream? The trip to the moon. - It was a momentary whim. - Whim? Oh, a trip to the moon can be, well, a liberal education. - That's true. - Of course. - Still - No still about it. Everybody should have a trip to the moon. I like your spirit, Hulen. You're not making much sense, but I like your spirit. So do I. Darling, let's make one more bet. - Just as a favor to Mr. Hulen. - Oh, thank you, thank you. My man's at the track and he knows just what to do. There goes $8 million. What's $8 million when you got a business manager like Mr. Hulen? $8 million. Oh, the race is on television. I'll get it on. ANNOUNCER: They're on. It's Banner in front. Toby's Boy is second. Joey Belle is third by two lengths. Darling Debby is fourth. Granny's Lover didn't even get started. Get moving, you ox. Don't stand there, stupid, run! Uncle Fester, please, I do not like crude talk, even to horses. Would you mind moving, sir? Granny's Lover trailing. Mr. Hulen, you don't seem to understand. Our horse is losing. - Yes. - That's bad. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Poor Mr. Hulen, I don't think he knows what's going on. State of shock. At the mile turn it's Toby's Boy by a head. Banner is second to half. Joey Belle third on the outside. Darling Debby is fourth the length. And here comes Granny's Lover. He heard me. He heard me. He heard me! Ride it, you old rascal! You gave Mr. Hulen such a fright. Come on, something. Granny's Lover is fifth! He's fourth! He's third! Mr. Hulen, do you hear? Our horse is gaining. Cheer up, old man. Somehow I have the feeling that Mr. Hulen is not enjoying this race. The excitement is too much for him. - I'd better turn it off. - No, no, don't please. I couldn't stand the suspense. Joey Belle and Granny's Lover. Joey Belle and Granny's Lover. Joey Belle and Granny's Lover. Granny's Lover on the outside is going to the front. He's driving! Joey Belle's on the move. Here he comes. He's moving up again. Head and head. Joey Belle and Granny's Lover. - They're heading for the wire. - Heading for the wire? Shouldn't they finish the race first? That's just an expression, querida. Pay no attention. - Come on. - I can't bear to watch. They're nose and nose! I can't even bear to listen. And the winner is Granny's Lover! Mr. Hulen? Mr. Hulen? That Hulen, can you imagine? Going to sleep during that race? Darling, let's wake him up and tell him the good news. Mr. Hulen? - The race is over. - Did Joey Belle win? Granny's Lover finally came through. ANNOUNCER ON TV: Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen. I don't like the way he said that. Granny's Lover has been disqualified for crowding, shoving and kicking. How ridiculous. What else do they expect from a horse? Well, I guess we'd better wake Mr. Hulen and break the news to him. Let him sleep, darling. Poor man will be so disappointed. Serves him right, the tout. Well, there's one consolation. It's still a nice round figure. I'm glad we didn't go to the moon. Yeah, I found out that there's no fish on the moon. We need some new fish for our aquarium. Ours ate each other up. Oh, Gomez, the children will be so disappointed. You know how they love their pet piranha. Think no more about it, my dear. There's always one man who's ready to help us with our problems. Mr. Hulen. Hello, Mr. Hulen? Addams here. I just called to tell you that I'm taking my family on a nice, long cruise. You are a darling. We're going to gather some fish for our children's collection. New ones. Have to go deeper and deeper, you know. So would you be a good chap and run out and buy us a submarine? With nuclear power, of course. Mr. Hulen? Hulen? By Jove, I think he's fallen asleep again. Strange man. Nothing seems to excite him. 
Uncle Fester. Lurch, I hope you don't mind my using your harpsichord. It helps me in my composing. How does it sound? I say, Lurch, how does it sound? How can I concentrate with Gomez tuning the harpsichord? Uncle Fester, he's not tuning it. He's composing on it. - That's composing? - What does it seem like? Well, it seems like composing, but it sounds like tuning. What are you composing, Gomez? A sonata for three hands. Three hands? It'll give Lurch a chance to play duets with Thing. Oh, that's very creative, darling. Mail's in. Thank you, Thing. The seal has a coat of arms. The only seal I ever saw had a coat of fur. Could be from Princess Millicent. Ah, yes. Oh, she's arriving for an extended visit. I thought princesses only lived in castles. Princess Millicent is in reality Gomez's Aunt Millie, from Marshy Bottom, Iowa. Then the coat of arms and the title is a fake, huh? No, Aunt Millie picked those up years ago when she married a Prince Von Schlepp. - Sounds glamorous. - Not really. Von Schlepp was a prince, but he was also a pauper. - The poor man. - That's usually what a pauper is. He squandered Aunt Millie's money on foolish investments. And when he died, all she had left was the title and a trunk full of worthless oil stock. She's been living on her relatives ever since. Poor thing. Clothed only in a coat of arms. Checkmate. I've always wanted to meet your Aunt Millicent. - She's certainly welcome here. - Bravo, querida. - Spoken like a true Addams. - Thank you, darling. And what's more, we must be especially nice to your Aunt To Princess Millicent. She must never feel like a poor relation in this house. In that case, we should give her the royal chamber. - Royal chamber? - Yeah, the one with the king-size bed. Charming. Your Highness. The other hand. Uncle Fester, what are you doing? I was practicing to greet the Princess. That's ridiculous. She may have married a prince, but she's still Aunt Millie from Iowa. My watches say 4:00. That makes it exactly 2:30. The princess should be here any minute. The princess. To the garage. - Well, well, if it isn't Aunt Millie. - It isn't. It's Princess Millicent. Of course. Well, how are you, Princess? You may call me "Your Highness. " It's a good thing I practiced. This is my lovely wife Morticia. Welcome, Your Highness. And this is our Uncle Fester. Guess this one's on me. My luggage is outside. You may rise. Easy for you to say. Fester, you'd better help Lurch with the princess' bags. Yes. It's not what I'm accustomed to. But I suppose it's better than a hotel. You'll love your chamber. It has a beautiful view. On a clear day you can see all the way to the swamp. But, of course, who wants a clear day? Would you like for me to help you unpack, Your Highness? It's not necessary. I'm traveling very light this trip. Besides, my handmaiden will help me. Handmaiden? Handmaiden. Allow me to present Lady Fingers. How do you do, Lady Fingers? She seems very lovely. Comes from a fine family. Her father used to be my footman. And now I think I'll retire to my chambers. Lurch will show you where they are. - I thought she said she was traveling light. - She is. Lurch and Uncle Fester are traveling heavy. I'm so glad she's here, though. And with Lady Fingers. I think she's just the companion that Thing has been longing for lately. He's right, she's left. The perfect match. We'll see. Thing. My, aren't they the shy ones! Lady Fingers, where are you? I need you up here at once. Oh, he missed his chance. Don't worry, he'll have others. He's handy that way. It's about time you showed up. When I give a command, I want it obeyed immediately. I do hope Lady Fingers won't pick up slothful ways around here. Oh, no. How did you find your chamber? - The bed is as hard as nails. - Knew you'd like it. And where on earth did you get those black drapes? - I really had to shop for them. - Ghastly. When she brought Lady Fingers, I thought she was a true Addams. Obviously, there's something wrong with her. Well, the poor dear has suffered so, what with her husband dying. Worse than that, he went broke. I do hope she stays, for Thing's sake. But she's accustomed to castles. Yes, she does live in a dream world. There must be some way we can make her feel at home. We couldn't convert this place into a castle. The ceilings are too low. - We can do everything else. - You mean You're reading my mind, aren't you, bubele? Tish, that name. Darling, control yourself. Royalty now, bubele later. Very well, but later you'll have to call me Sir Bubele. Gomez, darling, do hurry. The princess should be down any moment. Oh, darling, you do make a dashing cavalier. Not such a bad lady-in-waiting yourself. I wonder what's keeping her. Patience, my dear. A lady-in-waiting must learn to wait. Here she is. What's wrong with him? - Too big for his britches. - That's quite obvious. He left without being dismissed. You may go. Well, I can see this household will need a lot of training. And now I wish to be entertained. Do you hear? I wish to be entertained. Uncle Fester. Coming. Fester the Jester. What will it be, Your Highness? Sick jokes? Elephant joke? Limerick. "There was a young man from Dakota" No limericks, huh? How about stupid jokes? They're my specialty. See, this one stupe says to another, "Did you take a bath?" And the other one says, "Is one missing?" You may retire permanently. Yes, Your Highness. Mama, I understand you and the princess have had a spat. That woman is driving me batty. The only thing she'll let me serve is Chicken a la King. Well, that's the royalty business. Besides, Chicken a la King's rather tasty. Without the feathers? Some people have the dullest tastes. Here you are, Lurch. Now please try not to bow so low. This is the third time I've had to mend them. Must I Well, Lurch, maybe the princess will let you wear a suit of armor instead. Those things wear like iron. I'm so glad we kept up with our minuet. It's so appropriate now. Let them eat cake. In the dungeon. Off with their heads. Isn't that sweet? She's dreaming of the good old days. I give up. I want her to hear me. On account of her, I've been up nights studying old joke books, learning card tricks, even old bird calls. I just heard you do a vulture, Fester. You were terrific. That wasn't me. That was Her Highness, snoring. Nobody seems to be enjoying the princess' visit. Except those two. They finally got together. Let's leave them alone. Can I kiss your hand, Madame? Dear Lurch, he's such an incurable romantic. Just leave the bags here. I'll send for them later. Leaving us, Your Highness? Is something wrong? Everything is wrong. He won't bow anymore. And he doesn't amuse me. And this morning, I found a sign on my door saying, "Princess, go home. " I'm moving to a hotel, and don't try to stop me. I said don't try to stop me. I wouldn't dream of it. One moment, Your Highness. This whole house is subversive. To the hotel. We're free, Lurch. We're liberated. Well, smile, Lurch, smile. Gomez, darling, Mama tells me the princess is leaving. Better than that, she's left. She's gone to a hotel. And you let her? Dear, you know she can't afford it. Oh, yes, she can. Oil discovered in the desert? Remember all those worthless oil stocks I told you Aunt Millie had? They're not worthless anymore. Aunt Millie can not only afford to live in a hotel, she can afford to buy it. Hey, maybe we ought to get her back. Oil's well that ends well. "Oil's well. " Get it? That's a joke. You don't have to joke anymore, Fester. You're no longer a court jester. And you, Lurch, you can get back into long pants. - We are going back to normal. - Oh, wonderful. The Addams family is a democracy again. Exactly. From now on, I give the orders around here. - Gomez. - But nobody has to obey them. I'm sure glad I don't have to be funny anymore. We all are, dear. I just finished my sonata for three hands. You rang? Lurch, how would you like to play this with Thing? Can't wait to get at it, eh? Thing? Thing, are you there? Oh, Thing, Mr. Addams has finished his sonata for three hands and with Thing? Thing, what is it? Thing? - Something seems to be wrong with him. - Darling. His pulse is rather sluggish. We better contact the jungle and get Dr. Mbogo. You know how those jungle witch doctors are, Gomez. They just won't make house calls. - I don't think he needs a doctor, dear. - You mean he's beyond help? You don't think he's sick? - Lovesick. - Of course. It was written all over his cuticles. I'd never have dreamt he'd take it that hard. There's only one thing to do. We have to get Lady Fingers back. - But to do that, we must also bring back - Oh, no. We must make the sacrifice for Thing's sake. I'll have to start telling jokes again. Buck up, Lurch. As Mrs. Addams says, we must all make the sacrifice for Thing's sake. We must think Thing. Welcome, Your Highness. We greet Your Highness. Well, that's much better. You see, even the pages have turned over a new leaf. Children, you may go. Allow me to assist you, Your Highness. Lurch, come and bow for Princess Millicent. - Is he gonna be able to make it? - Oh, yes. Mama let out the seat of his trousers with a couple of accordion pleats. Accordion pleats? Musical pants. You see how glad we are to have you back, Your Highness? Naturally. Now that I'm rich again, you're all playing a different tune. Especially Lurch. Lurch, please show Her Highness to her chambers. Yes, Mrs. Addams. - Have you got it, darling? - Right here, cara mia. Did you hear his knuckles pop? True love. - Did you see that? - She certainly has aged. That couldn't be Lady Fingers. Maybe that's what she looks like without makeup. Nonsense. I'm going to ask the princess what this is all about. She must be coming. I can hear Lurch bowing. Princess, what happened to Lady Fingers? After I left here, she just moped and drooped all over the place. You fired her? Well, I'm certainly not going to have a handmaiden who just sits around twiddling her thumb. This is ridiculous. The whole idea was to get Lady Fingers back for Thing. Now we're stuck with the princess and a claw who's old enough to be Thing's mother. Lurch keeps bowing so much, his pants have to be retuned. What is it, Princess? One of my bracelets is missing. - Maybe you miscounted. - It was stolen. - And I know who stole it. Thing. - Oh, no. Don't contradict me. And I insist he be searched immediately. Just as I thought, he's gone. Thing? Thing? She's right, he's gone. You rang? Lurch, Thing is missing. Do you know where he went? Of course he doesn't know. Call the police. Oh, must we? Let's not be hasty, Your Highness. I feel there's some explanation for the whole affair. Gomez, darling, your wallet. My wallet? It's gone. Good thing I carry my money in my sock. No, no, darling. Oh, dear. She's locked herself in. My wallet. My bracelet. My joke book. My silverware. Well, that seems to be all. Then the old claw took it on the lam. Esmeralda, a thief! And an old hand at it, too. If Thing were here, I'd apologize to him. - Thing! - Where have you been? Lady Fingers! Of course. Thing went to find the woman he loved. I hope you'll come back to me. Oh, thank you. We'll take a trip around the world. But, Princess, you'd be separating her from Thing. They can get married, and Thing can come along and work for me. How about it, Thing? By george, he's going to wait for her. An engagement ring. You've really taken to that accordion, Morticia. Well, ever since our little incidents with the princess, I've grown a little accustomed to the sound. You've become rather royalty-conscious yourself, darling. Well, this outfit sort of makes me feel a bit more courtly. It does have a certain je ne sais quoi. Tish, that's French. Morticia, querida, where are you? Darling, please, not in that suit. Oh, yes, yes. You're right. That music is pretty exciting, too. Darling, I didn't play that. That was Lurch, wasn't it? He's really learned how to play those pants. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family You dance divinely, darling. Only with you, cara mia. Mail's in. - I didn't hear anything. - Probably a special delivery. I'll get it, Lurch. Thank you, Thing. And Thing, that was very nice castanetting. You're welcome. - Is it a bill? - No, dear. Oh, well. - It's from Cousin Itt. - Itt? What's he say? "Arriving Tuesday. Itt. " Some people have a talent for letter writing. Dear Cousin Itt. He does turn a colorful phrase. Morticia, today is Tuesday. - Cousin Itt? - I doubt it. Itt likes to climb through the window. That could be Park Commissioner Fiske. - Coming here? - At 7:30. That would make it exactly 7:30. He's right on time. Commissioner Fiske. Well, this is an honor, sir. My dear, our esteemed Park Commissioner. Commissioner, my esteemed wife. - How do you do? - How do you do? My husband always speaks so highly of you. Well, I What's that? That's our Uncle Fester. He always takes a light with him when he explores the tunnels under the house. That new one Pugsley dug is just great for banding bats. I got 20 of the little furry things already. Good work, Fester. Uncle Fester, this is Park Commissioner Fiske. I'm glad to know you, Mr Park Commissioner? When are you gonna get rid of those awful robins and larks that you have in your parks? They just keep chirping and warbling. They do make ghastly sounds. We can solve that problem, Commissioner. Uncle Fester could lend you his pet hawks. Clean up the park in one day. Pet hawks? Commissioner, what can we do for you? Well, as you know, the city is busily expanding its zoo. Zoos. Such homey places. Yes. Naturally, we depend on public-spirited citizens for financial support. Say no more, Commissioner. To whom shall I make it out, Commissioner? Oh, the check. Make it to the City Zoo. You really ought to slow down a bit, Commissioner. You've just started on the job and already you've got the shakes. Here you are, sir. $150,000 and 20 cents. - Twenty cents? - I threw in your car fare. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Uncle Fester. Thank you, Mrs. Addams. Thank you, Mr. Addams. And thank you You're quite right, darling. He should slow down. Ah, the gay abandon of the Csárdás. The wild rhythm of the tambourines. It sets my Gypsy blood afire. Darling, you have no Gypsy blood. I haven't? I must have a fever. Nonsense. C'est la dance. Tish, when you speak French it really drives me wild. - Mon ami. - That's it. Speak some more. Au revoir. Ooh, la, la. Darling, please. There's someone at the door. We're married. Cousin Itt? Wait here. Crepe suzettes. Comme ci, comme ça. Oui, oui, monsieur. Keep going. Keep going. Cousin Itt. - Tell him we're out. - Gomez. Go on, Tish. Speak some more. Moulin Rouge. Vive la France! Cousin Itt? Show him in, Lurch. Show him in. Oh, oh. You're too late. There he goes. Up the wall. And in through the window. Good old Itty. Comfortably settled in the attic before you can say, "Sweep out the cobwebs. " The perfect houseguest. I didn't get the last line. And then Marie Antoinette says, "Operator, I've been cut off. " You know, it's not the joke, though. It's the way that he tells it. Fester, you've never looked better. - Good morning, querida. - Good morning, darling. Where is everyone? They're up in Cousin Itt's room, helping him pack. He's leaving already? Just a rolling stone. I don't know. He seems to have gathered quite a bit of moss. I wonder why he's never married. Obvious. He likes to play the field. Maybe if he had a good job. He's such an amusing fellow. Perhaps in the field of entertainment? An actor? Cousin Itt? Darling, face it. He's much too short. Too short for an actor and too tall for a producer. I suppose show business is out. The Beatles? No. He'd be too much for them. Oh, it must be spring. The vampire bats are playing around the attic eaves. It's Cousin Itt. He's been attracting them in droves. Dear Itty. He always did have a way with bats. And baby rattlers. My dear, the new zoo. Commissioner Fiske once mentioned needing a new curator. Do you think he'd consider Cousin Itt? - Cousin Itt is a zoo type. - He is. If we could only convince the Commissioner. He'll listen to reason. Especially if I threaten to cancel the check. I'll call him. Why, thank you, Thing. He never gets a wrong number. Mrs. Addams, this is indeed a pleasure. I'm afraid I don't quite follow you. Let me put it this way. The most exciting contribution we can make to your new zoo is in our attic right now. Really? Well, I'll be right over. He's on his way over. Splendid. Cousin Itt's not leaving just yet. - Are you sure? - Positive. I'm locking him in. Here we are, Mr. Fiske. This is the key, Commissioner. The answer to all your questions is behind that door. - We'll be waiting for you downstairs. - Yeah, but That was a rather brief encounter. Say no more, Mrs. Addams. Say no more. You were absolutely right. This is the most sensational thing that's ever happened to the zoo. We knew you'd be impressed. Oh, I shall be back with a couple of attendants. We don't wanna lose him. Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you and thank you. Excuse me? Oh, this is the best thing that ever happened to the zoo. There must be some name? Why, of course, Commissioner. - Itt. - Itt? Itt. Oh, perfect. Absolutely perfect. The key to success, querida, the ability to detect and choose good manpower. Cousin Itt must have really turned on the charm. Itt's the one that can do it. And to think, he's coming back with an escort. This time I don't blame him. Cousin Itt is quite a prize. Yes. Now, keep those chains taut, men, and keep away from his fangs. - You, Smirch. - Lurch. Open that door. Lurch, the wine goblets. Please ask Cousin Itt to join us. I believe he left with the gentlemen from the zoo. Already? Looks like Cousin Itt's going to be a pretty busy man. He was quite tied up when he left. To Cousin Itt. Un momento, querida. Perfect. Thank you, Thing. Tish, you keep improving with every stroke. Such sweep. Such grandeur. - I know just what you should call it. - What? Chaos. Chaos? Darling, that's Mama. Oh, yes, yes. The new hairdo. That reminds me. Isn't it about time for Uncle Fester to come home from the zoo? FESTER: Howdy! There you are. How did it go, Uncle Fester? Oh, wonderful. I had 15 bags of popcorn. What about Cousin Itt? Oh, I didn't even see Cousin Itt. - No? - No. You see, he's got this nice big office with lots of fancy ironwork in the front of it. Boy, you should have seen the crowd that was waiting outside. That's Itt. Real take-charge man. I couldn't even get near him. But I did see them bring him his lunch. A nice big bunch of bananas. Smart. Fresh fruit to ease the ulcer-producing tensions of big business. And he'll need it, too. He's got problems on his hands. I heard on the car radio that one of the animals escaped. Oh? ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: According to the latest report, the escaped creature has been sighted in the Greenbrier Woodlawn area. That's our area. Citizens are urged to lock and bar all windows and doors. Take no chances with this strange beast. What are we gonna do? What any normal family would do. Protect ourselves as best we can. A capital suggestion. Everyone, en garde! Oh, even when I speak French. - Gomez. - Pardon me. I'll read this again. "Order of the day. "Shooting will be confined to the escaped beast only. "Not at just anything that moves. " All right. Who's the culprit? I guess I panicked. Lost my head. It's this awful strain waiting for that escaped beast to pounce on us. Uncle Fester, we're all in the same boat. Fester, why don't you make an inspection trip of all the traps I've set up through the house? That'll keep you occupied. And Fester, if you start to crack up, think of Cousin Itt and all the problems that he's facing now. I'm so ashamed. This is rather like being in the jungle again. Isn't it, dear? You were wonderful to have on safari, Tish. No one could skin a hippopotamus like you could. Darling, any housewife can do that. You were the remarkable one. Well. I'll never forget when that tiger broke cover And charged our gun-bearer. Ah, yes. Dear Ali Casbah. Quick as a wink and without a moment's hesitation, you snapped your gun to your shoulder and fired. Bagged ourselves a wonderful gun-bearer. Poor Ali. He did recover quickly, though. He must get used to that sort of thing. Now, what are you going to do about that, cara mia? Caramba. Oh, I'm sorry, darling. That escaped beast is preying on my mind. I just can't concentrate. Querida, couldn't concentrate? At the door? You're a good lookout, Thing. En garde, my dear. This may be the beast. Just a moment. Oh, that's much better, dear. There's no one there. Cousin Itt? What are you doing here? You should be at the zoo taking charge of things. Isn't that like our dear cousin? Wanting to be with his loved ones at our moment of peril. Very decent of you, Itt, but it isn't necessary. If that beast shows up here, we'll give him a warm welcome. Well, you might as well come in and rest up a bit. (CHATTERING) "What monster?" he says. You don't have to spare us, Itt. We know all about it. It's a shame it had to happen your first day on the job. Itt, stop pretending. You know what we're talking about. Maybe he should have become an actor. It's all over the radio. ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: Our latest report has the escaped monster entering the Addams house on North Cemetery Drive. Park Commissioner Fiske is reported racing to the scene. In what Follow me. On second thought, I'd better follow you. Gomez, are you sure the monster is nowhere in the house? I've searched top and bottom. No monster. GOMEZ: I'll get it, Lurch. You look after the children. - This may be the moment of truth. - Darling, what do you mean? I didn't think you'd ask. Addams, are you all right? Tiptop, old man. It's so sweet of everyone to be so concerned about us. I just came here to warn you That the beast has been seen entering our house. Utter nonsense. Why would it come here? Well, there is something about this place. Thank you. But we've seen neither hide nor hair of any monster. What does the beast look like? Well, you know perfectly well what he looks like! He's about Well, he's got Look out! Look out! Run for your lives! The monster! - Where? Where? - There! There! Oh, that poor man. He's really got it bad. Complete crackup. Can't even recognize his own right-hand man. He broke out of his cage. Itt, at this rate it looks as though you'll have to take over completely. - What? - What? Is that true, Commissioner? Is what true? Stop stalling, Commissioner. You heard him. Only one thing can prompt an act like that, Itt. Insane jealousy. Locking our cousin in jail. Why, I'll have you broken down to junior-grade White Wing for this! Cousin? Good thing I drew that check on the wrong bank. - But - Commissioner, an apology is in order. Apology, my eye. Will you choose your burial place and weapon, sir? Now, Fester, let's not have any dueling. That's right. I'll shoot him in the back. - Would you please turn around, sir? - Wait a minute. Will you stop him? This must be settled with honor, Fester. All right, give him a blindfold. Uncle Fester, he must be given a fair chance. Very well, Mr. Commissioner, I'll give you a fair chance. I get a shot, then you get a shot. Now, about face! No, no, Uncle Fester, there will be no shooting. It does disturb the neighbors. I'll call the mayor. No. No, no, please, not the mayor, I beg of you. Very well, we'll forget the mayor. I'll call the governor. See? Even Thing's indignant. - What? - What? - You liked being in a cage? - Then why did you run away? Well, that makes sense. He wanted to pick up his military hairbrushes. Commissioner, I'm afraid our apology is in order. I'll send you another check as soon as I recall what bank my money's in. Forget the apology, forget the check. Just let me out of here. MORTICIA: I'm afraid we cannot permit Cousin Itt to accompany you. The work is very healthy, but it's unbecoming of an Addams. Well, in case you change your mind, I'll reserve a cage for him. In fact, I'll reserve cages for all of you! Cages for all of us? I'm not sure I'd like that. Of course not, darling. We'll insist on one big family cage. Good morning, Lurch. - Cara mia. - Good morning, darling. - Did you sleep well? - I had the funniest nightmare. You do look nice and rested. Not tripe of salamander? With hard sauce. The perfect breakfast. ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: We interrupt with a special announcement. An hour ago a dangerous creature broke out of the city zoo. When last seen, the monster was heading for the Greenbrier Woodlawn area. That's us again. Shall I bolt the windows and doors? Nonsense, it's probably another relative. Better set another place. Oh, and, Lurch, bring a nice big bunch of bananas. 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family MAN: Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -GOM EZ: Caught in the act. -Gomez, darling, you startled me. What a thing for a husband to see. On the day when an old suitor is coming to visit, he finds his wife striving to make herself even more beautiful. Darling, Lionel Barker was not an old suitor. He's just a childhood friend. Yet when you got his Ietter, your eyes Iit up Iike candles in a cave. You need be jealous of no one. I've been yours since that first day you carved my initials in your Ieg. And I have been yours since the day I first saw you riding sidesaddle on a buffalo. querido. querida. Then you don't mind that I plan to ask Lionel to be our houseguest? Not at all. I want him to see what a Iovely home we have. Would you Iike to see what I've done with the guest room? Delighted. Though it may give me a twinge. -Charming, absolutely charming. -I knew you'd be pleased. How did you ever think of all these homey Iittle touches? Just a knack. Will you Iook at that? -This mattress, it's harder than ours. -No mattress, silly. -Natural wood. Knotty pine. -Superb. Do you really think Lionel will Iike it? If he's a man of taste, and I'm sure he is. Look, Lionel, you think it's worth it? Going into that creep joint, I mean. As I remember this Morticia dame, she's even spookier than this house. I know they got dough, Iots of it, and we need some now. What're you gonna give them? That uranium stock spiel? I have a feeling they're more the phony oil stock type. Now, wait here and keep your fingers crossed, Charlie. -Yes? -I Mrs. Addams is expecting me. I'm Lionel Barker. Follow me. -You're the butler? -Lurch, sir. Lurch. Pardon me. -Lionel? -Morticia! -Lionel, how good to see you. -You haven't changed a bit. -Except that she's married now. -This is my husband, Gomez Addams. -Lionel Barker. -You certainly married a wonderful girl, Mr. Addams. Yes, a man so seldom gets the wife he deserves. Yeah, yeah. It's quite a place you have here. As Iong as you're in town, it's your home. -Oh, no, really, I couldn't. -We insist. We'll send for your bags. They're right outside. I happened to bring them with me. How fortunate. Darling. You rang? Lurch, Mr. Barker's bags are outside. PIease take them to the guest room. Perhaps our Mr. Barker would Iike to join us in a cup of tea. That would be marvelous. And we can chat about those glorious, gloomy days of our youth. -Those were the fun days. -Yes. Do you remember the first time we met? I was in the garden, playing with Hubert and Henery. And you strolled by, and I asked you in. And I said I'd come in if you got rid of Hubert and Henery. MORTICIA: I never understood why. -They were such adorable vultures. -Just not my type, I guess. Darling, I'm afraid we're Ieaving you out of the conversation. You know how it is when old friends get together. Excuse me, I have an urgent call to make. Must you, dear? We'll miss you. Mr. Barker will be able to amuse you while I'm gone. -Hope I didn't upset him. -Gomez? Dear Gomez. There's not a jealous bone in his body. "You know how it is when old friends get together. " Wonderful, wonderful. Says we're gonna have a big storm tomorrow. Uncle Fester, I'm baring my soul to you, and you just stand there casually reading your newspaper, and Iast year's. I've been trying to catch up on my reading. This is the first quiet moment I've spent in this thing in days. Mama practically Iives in it. You know something? She's getting selfish in her old age. Fester, what am I going to do about Lionel? Who's Lionel? Lionel? I really had a case on you in those days. Even wrote a poem about you. Yes, a very romantic one, if I remember correctly. I've kept it with all my other treasures, down in the basement. -Pretty silly stuff, really. -I don't think so at all. How did it go again? LIONEL: "Morticia, you are the only one for me. "I know I shall always want you for my very own. " Can it be true, Uncle Fester? Can she actually be smitten with this Lionel? -Who's Lionel? -Fester. Oh, that Lionel. Must be. Just going off riding with him. I engineered that so we could talk. Well, still, forgetting to feed her plants. Poor things, they're nearly starved. They won't even Iet me feed them. A hideous how do you do. -Why don't you throw him out? -I couldn't. She would have thought that I was jealous. -Are you? -Of course. It's gnawing at my insides, Iike a tiger gnawing at an antelope. I wish it would stop. I'm beginning to enjoy it. Well, you gotta get rid of him somehow. I have a plan. We'll make it so uncomfortable for him that he'll want to Ieave. -I'll need your help. -You can count on me. -First, we rearrange his room. -Brilliant! Well, no use Ietting this go to waste. Why doesn't she cook this for us? It's horrible, Gomez. Just horrible. -Yes, we've done a magnificent job. -It's more than any man could stand. Lionel is going to run screaming into the night. Feel this mattress. Eugh. Listen to this. Just Iisten to that awful bird. I can't stand it. Let's get out of here. I can't wait till tomorrow morning at breakfast, just Morticia and me. No Lionel. That's the best breakfast I've had in days. Gomez, darling, you haven't touched yours. -I've Iost my appetite. -I must say, you folks are wonderful hosts. That room. That beautiful, soft, downy bed. And that gorgeous canary singing me to sleep. And those carnations. In your room? -You really Iiked them? -Loved them. Well, I must call my business associate. Excuse me. By the way, I dabble in stocks and I might be able to put you onto something good. We'll discuss it a Iittle Iater, okay? Gomez, I don't see how you could have done such a terrible thing to our guest. -Yes, I do. You're jealous. -Me? Jealous? That's Iaughable. No, no, Charlie. I'm not stalling. I gotta give the guy the buildup. Just sit tight and pretty soon we'll split a bundle. Yeah, bye-bye. You know, when I'm through here, Gomez, you ought to stretch out for a while. -Wonderful picker-upper. -I don't have time. We must concoct another scheme to break up this romance. I have it. A diversionary tactic. Another woman. Oh, that's good. You mean to come between him and Morticia, huh? Right. A seductive creature with an irresistible allure. Now, where can we find one? How about Grandmama? You know, the merry widow. No, Grandmama prefers taller men. But she is the type we want. Maybe we could get my old sweetheart, Queenie. No, she'd never Ieave the circus. Those bearded Iadies make a fortune. If only he hadn't seen Lurch. You know, he'd be ideal in a wig and a dress. If only Lurch were a maid instead of a butler. That's it. A maid. I'll hire a maid from an employment agency. I'll insist on one who is interested in getting married. Good. Right this way, Miss What is your name? Mildred, sir. -Gee, this place is sort of spooky. -Thank you. -Now, about your duties -Oh, no. I'm not staying. -I think I can change your mind, miss. -You don't have that much money. But I do have a houseguest. A dashing young bachelor who would find you most attractive. A man, sir? The kind who needs a wife. In fact, he is seeking one desperately, and it could be you. Well, this isn't such a bad place after all. Your room is right in there. Well, Uncle Fester, it Iooks Iike we have a winner. A knockout. Those tiny eyes shining through her glasses. And did you notice the way her knees knock together? Uncle Fester, at your age. I've still got an eye for beauty. By tomorrow, Lionel will be her slave. -Is there anything I could bring you, sir? -No, no. -Tea or coffee? Milk? Vegetable juice? -No, no, no and no. What's the matter with you, anyway? You followed me all over the place Iast night. When I turned in, I Iooked under the bed to make sure you weren't there. -Now there you go again. -She's not making much progress. Too shy. I'll Iight it for you, sir. That does it. This girl needs instruction in the art of Iove from an expert. You? In my younger days, I had women eating out of my hand. A bit messy, wasn't it? You're simply too timid. You've got to move in on him. -You mean chase him? -I mean catch him. Grab him in your arms, Iike this. And pour out your heart. No Ionger can I hide my feelings, my Iove. Give me your Iips. There, have you got it now? Where is Lionel? Which way did he go? Never mind. I'll find him. Thank you, Thing. I'm sorry to make a spectacle of myself, Thing. But my world has come down around my ears. There's another woman. No, it's true, there is. I know you can be blase about it. You've never been married. Or have you? I thought not. Thing, what am I gonna do? No, no. No violence. Not even hair-pulling. Nor eye-scratching. Thank you, anyway, Thing. Thing? Wish me Iuck. Thank you, Thing. You're a true friend. I didn't know you were out here, Morticia. Uncle Fester, I know why Gomez brought that woman into this house. Oh, you do, huh? Well, so do I, and I think it's a fine idea. A fine idea? No, no. CIeopatra, no. I will not condone violence. Down, girl. I think I'll go upstairs to my room and Iie down for a while. I'm going up the back stairs. You see? Everything worked out fine, smarty. You hit me in the nose. Well, well, well. Checking your stocks, I see. How're they going? Up, naturally. You know, you folks have been wonderful to me, Gomez. In fact, I'm very fond of the whole family. -Especially Morticia, hmm? -I've always had a warm spot for her. What I started to say was, I'm going to do you a big favor. You see, a pal of mine is the president of the South Tasmanian Oil Corporation If your pal put your money into South Tasmanian Oil, you ought to have him boiled in it. The market is bullish today, Lionel. I mean, Mr. Barker. Bullish? You mean, you really dig this jazz? Well, I've always put my money into stocks. Let's not talk about stocks, Mildred. Let's talk about you. -Me? -Come. Let me gaze into your big, beautiful, blue chip Eyes. Is something wrong? Tell me. I think you know what's darkened our Iives. Yes, I fear I do. The hands that should caress my Ioving feet now caress the dragon. But who are you caressing in your mind? Not me. Gomez, please Ieave me. I can't talk now. I must think. Very well. If that's what you want, I'll go. I, too, must think. There is no Ionger any doubt about it. She's in Iove with Lionel. -Well, what are you going to do? -The only decent thing I can do. Leave this Iife, and Iet Morticia marry the man she Ioves. -You mean you're going to kill yourself? -Of course not. Suicide is the coward's way out. I'm going to Iet you kill me. Me? You're my favorite nephew, Gomez. You've been nice to me. I Iike you. AII I ask is one small favor. Shoot me. Well, if I refuse, I'd be an ingrate. -AII right, stand over by the wall. -Thank you, Uncle Fester. You're a true friend. Ready. Aim. Fire. I would Iike to be shot, Uncle Fester, not drowned. I'm sorry, this must be one of the children's guns. -But I'll do better next time. -You must. It's the only bullet we have. Now, close your eyes. Lurch, I hope you're a better hangman than Uncle Fester was a marksman. It's my rope, isn't it, Gomez? I furnished the rope. That's a bit scratchy. Better, sir? That's fine. Thank you, Lurch. Very comfortable. Would you throw the other end of the rope up over the rafter? No, no, wait a minute. It's my rope. I can AII I have to do is just throw it up over this rafter Iike this. What's the matter with that thing? Uncle Fester, do you recall where you got that rope years ago? Sure, don't you remember? I got it from an old friend of mine, Raj Maja, the Indian fakir. Yeah, he used to throw it up in the air, then he'd climb Still works, doesn't it? It's no use, Lurch. Apparently, I am doomed to Iive. Sorry, sir. You rang? Gad, she's Iovely. How could I Iive without her? Yet I must. -Morticia, I must speak to you. -And I to you. Gomez, we've had a Iong and happy marriage. Yes, we have, indeed. Our Iife together has been filled with joy. Until now. I've heard of other marriages, where someone new has come along And Iove grew cold. And husband and wife have come to the parting of the ways. We have come to the parting of the ways, Gomez. Our hour has struck. We've gotta do something, Lurch. Soothing music? To the harpsichord. -What will be, will be. I have no regrets. -Nor do I. -AII I want is your happiness. -My only wish is to make you happy. Now that you're in Iove with someone else, I'll step aside. Though my heart is breaking, I'll freely give you up, -so you can go away with Mildred. -So you can go away with Lionel. -Mildred? -Lionel? Somebody call us? I don't want Mildred. -I thought you were in Iove -With Lionel? Me? -querido. -querida. We just dropped in to give you the good news. We're off on our honeymoon. -Honeymoon? -You're married? About an hour ago. At City Hall. -Congratulations. -That's wonderful. Well, Iet's go, baby. -Gomez, I'm so happy for them. -I'm even happier for us. If I wasn't such a rotten shot, you wouldn't be here, would you? What's this? I nearly did an impulsive thing, my dear. But my guardian spirit was Iooking after me. -Somebody down there Iikes me. -Somebody up here Iikes you, too, bubele. There. "When the blazing sun has turned to mud "and the moon Iies dead in a pool of blood, "and the tom-tom beat of eternity starts, "whom will I Iove in my heart of hearts? "Morticia. " Gomez, that's beautiful. And it's such a perfect night for poetry. I just wanted to show you that Lionel's not the only one who can write poetry for you. Oh, Lionel. He couldn't hold a candle to you. Perhaps we should Iet him try it sometime. Might be a fascinating experience. -No, he'll be too busy for that. -Oh? Working night and day, poor chap. Those stocks his wife owns, down to nothing. Really? Well, things Iike that don't matter, not when you marry for Iove.

They keep the children off the streets. By the way, dear, Wednesday is celebrating the loss of her front tooth. -Oh, she looks much prettier without it. -I think so, too. FESTER: I've had it! Morticia, Gomez, this child has got to be whacked. We do not go around whacking people in this house. -Certainly not without good reason. -I have a very good reason. She's been shooting off all of my dynamite caps. But, darling, you have dynamite caps of your own. But they're not any fun. They just go "poop. " At your age, a little "poop" ought to be enough. All right, I'm afraid you're gonna have to be punished. -And good. I'll put her over my knee. -No, no, no, now. I prefer a punishment that will leave an impression on her mind. -Excellent thinking, my dear. -For the next two weeks, you are forbidden, absolutely forbidden, to play with your pet spider. Not play with Homer? It may seem harsh, Wednesday, but you'll be a better person for it. You may go now. Softies. -You think it'll leave a scar? -Oh, nonsense. In a few days, she'll be as bright and chipper as a little bat. -You're really running away from home? -Yep. -Got any money? -12 cents. Good. I thought you were broke. Hey, I know a place you can run away to for nothing. -Where? -My room. You can hide there and just pretend you've run away from home. Then I can run away and still be around to see them suffer. -Let's go. -Wait. You can't run away without leaving a note. -Oh, what'll I say? -I'll think of something. The question is where to hang it. It would just light up the entire attic. Darling, why didn't I think of that? Mother, Father, Wednesday's flown the coop. -Talk sense, boy. -She's run away from home. Really? Very adventurous spirit. I didn't run away from home until I was eight. -That's ridiculous. -She even left a note. -I helped her write it. -"Dear Mother and Father, I hate you. "Love, Wednesday. "P. S. Don't bother looking for me because I'm not anywhere. Goodbye, W. " Well, why would the child leave a nice homey place like this? You're right. She's probably hiding somewhere. -Oh, no. She's not hiding anywhere. -We'll organize a search party. Comb the entire house. Mother, aren't you going to drag the rivers? Tomorrow. Wednesday's a good swimmer. Her note was right. She doesn't seem to be anywhere. -Unless she's here in Pugsley's room. -Oh, no. She's not in here. If you knew she was running away, why didn't you stop her? You know women. Once they've made up their minds Oh, my little girl. She's out there in the world, all alone. Don't worry, querida mia, she'll be all right. She comes of sound stock. But, darling, even an Addams can be led into temptation. Supposing she wanders on a playground, tries to teeter-totter. She may even run away and join the Brownies. Gomez, we've got to call the -P-O-L-l-C-E. -You mean the fuzz? -What is the "fuzz"? -The bulls. Thought you had him there, didn't you? Please, Mrs. Tunnel, don't scream at me, will you, please? We brought the kid home. It's up to you to keep him there. Yeah, okay, okay. I'll put out another dragnet. But I'm warning you, no more helicopters. You're costing the city a fortune. Yes, okay, thank you very much. All right, I'm coming. -Sergeant Haley, Missing Persons. -Well, I have one. A missing person, of course. Look, lady. This is no time for jokes. Now tell me who's missing, and give me your address, please. My name is Mrs. Addams, and I want you to find my little girl, Wednesday. Look, I'll find her Tuesday, if I can, but don't give me no deadlines, will you, please? Wednesday is her name. Oh, and I suppose you're gonna tell me her middle name is Thursday, huh? -Friday. -Now come on, lady. Now, this is a place of business. Are you serious? Okay, okay, just tell me where you live and I'll come right out there. Uh-huh. Right next to acemetery? Yes, we have a lovely view of it. Thank you. -What news, Tish? -The police are on their way over. Good heavens. The neighbors will think we've committed some crime. Does make you feel like a fraud. Uncle Fester, the police are on their way over. They'll never take me alive. Wait, Fester, they're coming over because of Wednesday. Oh, that. I solved the Wednesday caper. -You mean you found her? -Found her? She was never lost. She's hiding out up in Pugsley's room. I got suspicious when I saw him sneaking food up to her. I don't believe it. -Would you believe your own eyes? -That depends. Uncle Fester, our children do not do sneaky things. Unless it's absolutely necessary. She's upstairs all right. That's what you get for sparing the paddle. Uncle Fester, please. FESTER: My father knew how to raise children. He used the paddle on me even when I was good. And if my mother interfered, he'd use it on her. Papa was strict but fair. And you had to respect him. If you didn't, whack. Even now, when I toss and turn in bed, I think of him. That's very touching, Uncle Fester. But we have no time for maudlin sentiment. Are you sure Wednesday is still upstairs? Just follow old Sherlock. You know, I wouldn't mind joining the police, if it wasn't for those silly uniforms they wear. Is she there? And as happy as a lark. The tricky little minx. I wonder which side of the family she got that from. Both sides. MORTlClA: Sergeant Haley? I was when I left home this morning. -Okay, lady, what about your kid? -Oh, she's fine. Is that why you dragged me all the way out here? -Now, that would be silly, wouldn't it? -Well, where was she? -Right here. -Right here? Clever, wasn't it? Running away from home with all the comforts of home. -Now look. If this is some kind of a gag -My dear man, our child has been safe at home all the time. Aren't you delighted? Oh, I'm tickled. After all, what else have I got to do? There are 683 missing persons on my file, four of which have been found. My phone rings 18 hours a day, three of them in my head. Half the kids in this town are lost, the other half should be. I am at the peak of a migraine headache, I haven't had my lunch, and you clowns drag me all the way out here and tell me your kid is fine! Delighted? Lady, I'm beside myself with joy! Emotional, wasn't he? Civil servants of today. The least little thing and they just fly apart. Well, what's our next move? We're going up and have a little talk with that girl. Gomez, the time has passed for talking. Fine, I'll get my old fraternity paddle. Whack! No, I have a much better way. Psychology. Oh, that's no fun. Uncle Fester, this is not a fun matter. That child has got to be taught to play with her own explosives. It's my turn to swing from the chandelier. Quick, under the bed. Well, I guess Wednesday is really gone. Someday, when she's slaving away in a tuna cannery, she may remember the life of ease she had in this lovely home. GOMEZ: Ragged, penniless, her little fingers bleeding from the tuna cans, she may return and say she's sorry. And when that happens, we'll take her back. If we have room. If they have room? Come, my dear. Let's go down and remove her pictures from the family album. They don't love me. -Oh, they're just using psychology. -What's that? I don't know, but that's what they're using on you. Guess they think that you don't have the nerve to leave home. Well, I'll show them. And I'm taking Homer with me. Oh, Gomez, I feel as though I were dancing with Nijinsky. And I with Pavlova. Must be the solving of the Wednesday crisis. Oh, that's one situation you handled admirably. There's a little girl who's home to stay. Wednesday, write me as soon as you get to the tuna cannery. Okay, bye. No, Mrs. Tunnel. We haven't found your boy yet. Do you realize this is the seventh time he's run away from home? No, I'm not suggesting you keep him locked up in a broom closet. But has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason he's running away from home is on account of you? Mrs. Tunnel? Mrs. Tunnel? There you are, sweetheart. Now, you go right over and see the nice sergeant, right there. Well, here's another one. -Oh, that's all I need. Another missing kid. -I'm not missing. I'm on my way to the tuna cannery. Look, honey, I've had a very rough day. Now, what's your name? Oh, it's gonna be one of those, huh? Would the nice young lady like a nice big strawberry ice cream cone? -No, sir. -Well, what would you like? A dead fly. -Fly? -For my spider. He's hungry. Yeah, I believe you. Look, take her over to the social worker, will you? -What's a social worker? -Oh, now, don't worry, honey. She's just a nice sweet old lady who'll get you some apple pie and she'll play beanbag with you, and she'll read you stories about Goldilocks and Rumpelstiltskin. -You mean fairy tales? -Yeah. -Where they slay dragons? -And old witches. Oh, no, please. I'll talk. My name is Wednesday Addams. Addams? There's something fishy going on here. Yes, sir. -What's that number again? -Cemetery 1-3 Yeah, I know, I know. Candle flame. Oh, Gomez, that was so masterful. Now it's your turn. Come to me. Caramba. Darling, let me up. It's probably my poetry club. Tell them you've resigned. Gomez, darling, let me up. Thank you. -Hello? -Hello, Mrs. Addams? -This is Sergeant Haley. -Oh, yes. It's that nice Missing Persons fellow. Mrs. Addams, it's a kind of a policy of ours to sort of check back at certain troublespots. -Your little girl still home? -Why, yes, she is. How sweet of you to ask. He's concerned about Wednesday. Isn't that nice? And, Mrs. Addams, just for the record, would you mind describing her, please? MORTlClA: Not at all. She has the most adorable figure. Mmm-hmm. And she's about, say, about 3'6", would you say? Yes. And the most soulful eyes. Don't forget her striking complexion. Oh, yes. And she has the loveliest pallor. And by any chance, does she have long braids? Why, yes. How clever you detectives are. -And you're sure she's still home? -Snug as a baby bat in her little cave. Mmm-hmm. Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Addams. That tells us everything we wanna know. Thank you. It's a great joy to know you're watching over us, Sergeant. Thank you very much. Keep your eye on that kid. I'm going over there and check this thing out. Yes, sir. Where are you going? -I'm tired of running away. -I think I'll go home. -No, no, sweetheart. No. You're gonna stay right here until somebody responsible comes for you. -Wednesday. -Uncle Fester. Oh, I looked all over town for you. Pugsley told me you ran away. -Are you related to this kid? -He's my uncle. Well, can't you see the family resemblance? Let's go. No, now, now, wait, wait, wait just a minute. I gotta have time to think. Get that big paw off of me Easy does it, my dear. -A prowler. -Good work, Lurch. -Let's have a look at the scoundrel. -All right, put me down. Sergeant Haley, we weren't expecting you. -But it's so nice of you to come. -Will you put me down, you big ox? Lurch, put the sergeant in the good chair. -You must forgive dear Lurch. -Only doing his duty. So much riffraff around these days, you know? Yes, you can say that again, and most of that riffraff is parents. -I'm sure you meet some terrible families. -Oh, do l! You'd be surprised, some of the weirdos I meet in this business. -Really? -Yes, really. Right now, at this very minute, I've got a little runaway down at the station. A pathetic little thing with long braids. And you think her parents even know she's gone? How frightful! -Parents like that should be horsewhipped. -HALEY: You're so right. Wait a minute, Sergeant. Did you say a little girl with long braids? Yes, she has long braids and a little pet spider. And by a strange coincidence, she happens to be named Wednesday. -Morticia, do you realize what's happened? -Of course I do. The sergeant's suffering from hallucinations. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to have some explanations, too, before I leave. -Now, lady, what about your runaway kid? -Poor sergeant. His work has taken a heavy toll. Reminds me of old Bagby, my Egyptian camel master. One moment as sane as you or l. The next moment completely amok, running naked into the Nile. Look, now, don't try to double-talk me. I'm taking the two of you down to police headquarters. Thank you very much, Sergeant, but we have a previous engagement. Look, don't you understand, lady? Your kid scrammed! Now, why would the child want to leave this lovely home? Why? Because she's probably sick and tired of living in this madhouse. Look at that. You rang? All right, you. Easy on the rough stuff. Lurch, you must forgive the sergeant. I'm afraid he's walked one beat too many. Now, look, you people All right. Whoever you are, come out from out from under there or so help me, I'll let you have it. Come, old chap, give Daddy the gun. -What's that? -Our son, Pugsley. He's never happier than when he's shooting off his dynamite caps. And Wednesday's happy with her headless dolls. Happy? Lady, don't you understand? Your kid's run away. -Oh, those hallucinations again. -Really, old chap, you should see a psychiatrist. -I need a head shrinker? -Typical case. The more they need help, the harder they fight it. Now, look. Here. If that kid's in her room, I'll turn in my badge, all right? Well, now that won't be necessary. But if it will make you feel any better, I'll go up and get her. Sergeant, you're right. Wednesday isn't in her room. Well, really! She's outside on the porch, playing with her Uncle Fester. Oh, outside, playing with her Uncle Fester? -Where are you going? -Oh, out there somewhere. Sergeant Haley, is there anything we can do for you? Yes, you can call the police station and tell them you want to report a missing person. -Emotional, isn't he? -I told you. Tish, Consolidated Plus just hit 100. Really? What did you pay for it, dear? But these little fluctuations mean nothing. -Uncle Fester? -Little Wednesday. -That was quite a "poop. " -Well, she's been such a good child lately, I thought I'd buy her a few fresh dynamite caps. Just a few. Of course, you can't spoil them. The mail's in. Thank you, Thing. It's from Sergeant Haley. Well, what's the poor devil have to say? Oh, he says he's fully recovered and he's starting all over again as a junior detective in Wabash, lndiana. -He needs more training. -Oh, there's a P. S. He wants us to send him his badge, collect. Well, I guess we'll just have to give it to him. Now which one was Sergeant Haley's? 
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat. Sweet. Petite. So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Querida. Thank you, Gate. - Oh, it's so good to be home. - Place looks as warm and inviting as ever. Bat-hunting is fun, but it's nice to be back among our own surroundings. - What do I do with the bats? - Just turn them loose in the attic. Oh, and Lurch, you may have a few of them for your room. Wait till the children see them. They'll have a ball. Bats and ball! Rather clever, eh, Lurch? I knew you'd appreciate it. Dear Mama. I'm so glad we're home, really. If we leave her alone too long, she tends to brood. I don't know why. She has her lizards and her comfy nail bed. And if things get dull she can always throw darts at Uncle Fester. Dear Uncle Fester, he's so sweet that way. And he makes such a lovely big target. Mama! Uncle Fester! The hunters are home from the hill. - Gomez, do you smell something? - Your perfume. Cara mia, it sets my blood aflame. - Darling, it's not me. It's that. - Oh? MORTICIA: Mama's been burning incense again. She knows I can't stand it. - You know what that means, don't you? - I'm gonna have a sinus attack? She's been telling fortunes while we were gone. Oh, I thought she kicked that habit years ago. Oh, dear. The worst? "Sit down and be quiet. Madame Bovary will be with you in a jiffy. " Mama does have style. The last time she went on a fortune-telling spree, she was Madame De Pompadour. Oh, darling, lead me in. I don't think I can look. Courage, my dear. It's probably just a practical joke of Mama's. - Well? - I think we'd better go back to the hunt. Well, my dear, Mama hasn't lost any of the old carnival spirit. Masquerading as a gypsy. It's so unbecoming. She does have occult powers, though. She predicted that I would run every business I ever had right into the ground. And, by George, she was right. Pure coincidence. Darling, how are we going to get her to stop this without hurting her feelings? I could set the tent on fire. Dear Gomez, you still have traces of Mamoud Khali Pasha Addams. The firebug of the Bosporus. Breeding will tell. We'd better have a look. Isn't this exciting? Tell me everything. - It's all in the ball. - Oh, yes. Here's a little gratuity for you, Madame Bovary. Madame Bovary thanks you. Must be the excitement. Why, that naughty Thing. - He's in this with her. - Working hand in hand. What do you see? - I see a jail. - A jail? - And you are in it. - Oh, that's impossible. Lady, kindly don't argue with me. Argue with the ball. - I'm sorry. Tell me more. - Time's up. - See? - Incredible. Well, if you get any more messages from up there, just call me. Of course, of course. Next please! She's fabulous. GRANDMAMA: Next. Keep moving. "Lizard tails and rattlesnakes, In the cauldron boil and bake "Eye of newt and toe of frog, "Wool of bat and tongue of dog, Spirits high and spirits low "Tell us what we want to" Oh, oh. Well, I guess it's time to be getting lunch. - Mama, aren't you ashamed? - I don't see why. I love reciting Shakespeare. Besides, I made $84 in tips. Not bad. I don't care about the money. I like telling fortunes. Out of the question. Oh, please, just a few more? - Not another one, Mama. - Querida, be lenient. Look at the anguish in that soulful face. Well, just one more. And then that goes back where it belongs. On the chandelier. I do wish Mama would come out of that tent. She's hoping to go into a trance. It seems to do things for her personality. - Peerless Lead just went up to $209. - And you sold it at $4? - $3. - How thoughtful. Whatever would we have done with a houseful of lead? This is the place, sergeant. I'll go inside. You wait out here. You see anybody come running out, arrest 'em. FESTER: Howdy! - Are you Madame Bovary? - Do I look like Madame Bovary? - Sorry. - Where did you hear about the Madame? Well, somebody recommended her. She really that good? Well, if you like that looking-into-the-future stuff. Me, I'm a practical man. Now, electricity. That's something you can believe in. See what I mean? Please, would you just take me inside? Well, if you prefer mumbo-jumbo to science. Come on. It's up. It's down. It's up. It's down. It's gone. Come on. Come on. Mama, I got a live one. Oh, Morticia, Gomez. When did you get back? - Short while ago. - Did you bag me any buzzards? Oh, yes, we got you some beauties. We caught them right at molting time. Oh, isn't that wonderful? Aren't you gonna introduce us to your friend? Oh, he's no friend. He just wants to get his fortune told. GRANDMAMA: "Lizard tail and rattlesnake, In the cauldron boil and bake" - What was that? - Mama warming up. Madame Bovary during office hours. Can I go in? You'd better, before she goes into a trance. - Trance? - Good luck. Oh, I do hope Mama conducts herself with poise and dignity. Can't be more dignified than that. - You naughty little man. - What are you talking about? Lulu May Lou from Louisville. - Lulu May Lou from Louisville? - Kansas City? I don't know Lulu May Lou from Kansas City either. Sally May Lou? - Lulu May Sally? - Let's forget it. You were gonna tell me about the future. Oh, yes. Your future is coming through. I can see it clearly. Yeah, well, I can see yours even more clearly. - Oh, you a gypsy, too? - No, I'm a police officer. Lady, you're going to jail. I better get a new ball. Everybody seems to be going to jail. Well, I don't know about everybody. But lady, you're under arrest. Come on, Madame Bovary. Back to the chandelier for you. Couldn't even tell me he was a police officer. - Is something wrong? - This big boor is arresting me. What's the meaning of this, Mr. Boor? This woman is under arrest for violation of the municipal code, Section 4-3-3-0. And she's going down to the station with me. Sorry, old man, we can't permit Mama to go out with strangers. He's right. We've never been properly introduced. Really? Well, allow me to introduce myself. Police Lieutenant James Poston. - How do you do? - How do You're pinched. - Fine beginning. - Don't fret, Mama. You'll have the greatest legal brains defending you since Clarence Darrow. - But, darling, I haven't practiced in years. - This will be excellent practice for you. You're right. First thing we'll do is obtain an injunction. An injunction for what? Oh, I'll think of something. Doesn't hurt to have one handy. Are you ready, Madame Bovary? From now on, I'll thank you to call me Madame X. Courage, Mama. We'll have you out of jail by sundown. - How, darling, how? - Conceal a hacksaw in a pie. Hacksaw in a pie. But isn't that dangerous? Remember when we did that for Cousin Cringe? - Cousin Cringe? - Yes, he ate the hacksaw. In fact, he developed a taste for them. Yes. Well, forget the hacksaw. - We'll claim insanity. - Mama's? - The Lieutenant's. - Very clever. - I'm not sure it'll work. - Why not? - Politics. - Oh, that's true. I'll have the law declared unconstitutional. Lieutenant Poston's 3-3-4-0 will be erased from the statutes. Brilliant, darling, absolutely brilliant. But didn't Lieutenant Poston say that law was 4-3-3-0? Or was it 3-3-4-0? Maybe it was 3-0-0-0-0-0. I'll have them all declared unconstitutional. Can't be too careful, you know. Darling, it's so reassuring to have Mama's defense in your hands. Well, they didn't call me "the Loophole" for nothing. No, the name fits you perfectly. - I'm worried about one thing. - Worried? Cara mia. - About what? - I don't know what to wear to court. Hey, let me out of here! Let me out of here! Mama, you poor darling, what are they doing to you? Nothing. I saw this cup-banging scene in a prison picture once. - You were very convincing. - Thank you. - Where's Gomez? - He's working on your release. - Never lost a case, you know. - Never won one, either. Perfect record. - Get your hands off of me. Release me! - Now keep moving, keep moving. Madame Bovary. Welcome, dear. You made it just as I predicted. - I told you she's fabulous. - What happened? Well, I was crossing a street in the middle of the block and an officer had the nerve to give me a ticket. So naturally I kicked him. Just bear with it. My husband will take your case as soon as he frees Mama. - Oh, is your husband a lawyer? - He's the great Loophole. Look, mister, I don't make the laws. Just pay the $10 fine and you can have her out in five minutes. I'm afraid I couldn't do that. It wouldn't give Mama time enough to do her famous mess hall scene. She just loves prison pictures. Look, I might even get the judge to reduce the fine. Oh, it's not a matter of money, it's a question of principle. Just what do you want? I demand an immediate trial, complete acquittal, and a full apology. Well, chum, you sure picked the right judge for that. First case. "The People v. Addams. " Bailiff, which one is the defendant? The odd-Iooking one. I repeat, which one is the defendant? The old bat on the end. Trolling on skid row? Fortune-telling. The others are her family. Figured. - Who's the complainant? - I am, Your Honor. This woman is in violation of the municipal code, Section 4-3-3-0. Is the defendant represented by counsel? - You are counsel for the defendant? - That honor belongs to my dear husband. Permit me to introduce the bar's brightest light, Gomez "Loophole" Addams. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What goes on here? Just sit tight, Judge, and we'll show you how to run a trial. - I warn you, I'll stand for no nonsense. - I object. - You object? - Just testing. - Bailiff? - Yes, Your Honor? - Is this some sort of a joke? - No, Your Honor. - And that Addams is really a lawyer. - I don't believe it. - I checked. - I still don't believe it. But we'll proceed. This is getting interesting. JUDGE: Proceed. And Mr. Addams, you'd better watch your step. Darling, I don't think he likes us. Maybe you'd better pay him the $10. - For a trumped-up charge? - Offer him $5. Nonsense, we've got him on the run. The first witness for the defense will be the victim of this outrageous miscarriage of justice, the defendant herself. - Swear her in. - I object. You object to your own witness taking the oath? I certainly do. It cramps her style. You avoided that trap very neatly, darling. Gracias, cara mia, gracias. Will you proceed? Yes, Your Honor. I shall ignore the prejudice, intimidation, and irregularities of this entire farce and caution you that no matter what the verdict is, I shall appeal. Order in this court. Order! - I object. - You object? Well, you don't expect me to sit here like a dummy, do you? - I hold you in contempt. - Well, that makes us even. That will cost you $50. Sounds reasonable. Now will you be quiet? Or would you like to try for $100? $100? Forget it. Sorehead. Sir, I warn you, you better shut your clack up and get on with this case. Yes, darling, I wish you would. That silly hammer is giving me a headache. Thank you, Thing. Makes a wonderful law clerk. - You need some more light? - Yes, please. That's better. - Thank you, Fester. - Pleasure. Your Honor, the simple rule of law involved here is amply demonstrated in the celebrated case of "Vauglin v. Broar" which reversed the decision of Shepherd against Flug which upheld the decision of ex parte Drake. Reaffirming the dictum Hold it, hold it. I wish you wouldn't interrupt my husband. Go on, darling, I'm fascinated. Would you mind telling me what all that's got to do with this case? - "Does Macy tell Gimbel?" - Maybe not. But let me tell you something. I'm beginning to doubt your credentials as a lawyer. - I resent that. - I think you're a fraud! That's different. Olé, olé. Listen, all of you, this is my final warning. Your Honor, please, that hammer. You run the noisiest court. - Perhaps you'd like to take over? - May I? - Be my guest. - Thank you. I think we may have misjudged the poor dear. That hammering does throw you. Come, cara. Perhaps you can penetrate the wall of bias and ignorance surrounding this travesty of justice. I can only try. Thank you, darling. Your Honor, one look at the accused should convince you that she is as innocent as a newborn babe. Madam, I've seen more innocent looks on Murder Incorporated. Must be this light. True, a crime had been committed, but not by this saintly old lady. Hear, hear. The real criminal is right here in this courtroom, hiding behind a shield of respectability. - There's the culprit. - Me? - Might as well confess, old boy. - Thought you'd beat the rap, huh? Wait till Lulu May Lou hears about this. - May I say a word? - Please do. - This is insanity. - Exactly what we claim. Your Honor, please. Did you or did you not enter our peaceful home, pretending to be a lover of the zodiac, and caused this entire mishmash? - Well, I - Answer the question. - Okay, I did. - The defense rests. Brava! Brava! Olé, olé, olé. Wonderful, Tish! You tore them to shreds, Morticia. - May I have another word? - Please, speak right up. Thank you. Well, in all my 30 years on the bench, I have never seen a more preposterous, idiotic, reprehensible display of court conduct. Well, it did start that way, but you redeemed yourself. There is only one verdict possible in this case. - Guilty. Guilty! - Thank you. But we beg you, be lenient with the poor lieutenant. Well, sorry we can't stay around for the sentencing. We're double-parked. JUDGE: You're not going anywhere. I'm declaring all of you guilty of the worst contempt I've ever been subjected to. If I have my way they'll reopen Alcatraz just for you. Isn't that sweet? Just a minute, Harvey. I'll have something to say about this. - Arlene, what are you doing here? - We'll get to that later. Right now, I demand that you set aside your stupid verdict. I'd rather be disbarred. Why, that old crow's not only guilty of fraud, she's Fraud? Why, she's positively psychic. She predicted I'd end up in jail, and I did. - In jail? - That's right, Your Honor. Your wife was picked up on a 412. - Well, you heard my decision. - Harvey. Case dismissed. - I'm free! - I told you we'd spring you. Right was on our side. Right and the judge's wife. This Zen-Yogi is wonderful for reading. So I see. What is it, Thing? We would like some more tea, yes. Thank you, Thing. - Darling, would you like your tea now? - Later, my dear. It's so good to see you with your law books again. Say something legal for me, dear. Non compos mentis. Very appropriate. My dear! Did you know that armed robbery was illegal? I'm glad. But doesn't that make for unemployment? Well, no law is perfect. That's true. Speaking of law, I wonder whatever happened to old Judge Saunders. I can find out, if you promise not to tell Mama. I promise. Thing? You can bring it out of hiding now. You're a sly one. Keeping the temptation from Mama. There he is. I can see him now. - And he's still a judge. - Supreme court? County fair. He deserved the promotion. 
NARRATOR". When we last glimpsed the masked man hunter he was about to be snapped to death by a gigantic bat trap. And a poor drugged Robin as the unwitting tool of his destruction. Batman's only hope is to join forces with Catwoman but we know he won't do that. Or will he? The incredible answer in just one moment. Have you reached a verdict? You win, Catwoman. I'll become your partner. But it's not that I'm afraid to die. I just don't want a murder rap hanging over Robin's young head. Robin, stop sawing. You realize I'll have to drug you with cataphrenic to make sure you're not faking. Of course, Catwoman. I wouldn't expect you to believe me. - There's no honor among thieves, Batman. - I'll buy that. Cataphrenic. L. Do you mind if I take a Bat-pill first, Catwoman? I feel a headache coming on. I feel a little woozy. Would you like some chicken soup? No, thank you. I think a Bat-pill will do. It's not that serious. You men are all hypochondriacs. All right, go ahead. Now, do with me as you like. Hey- You're a pretty good looker. You got some class, baby. Who are you? - I am your boss. -Yeah. Don't forget it. All right, boys, let's go. We've got some money to count. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Nine hundred ninety-nine thousand ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one million. Hey, hey, that's a neat haul, Cat baby. Only the beginning. A drop in the proverbial bucket. We're gonna live it up. We're gonna wail, doll. Nope. This money goes toward buying plans to the Gotham City Mint. The Mint? You don't fool around. Which way, sweetheart? Drive straight out along Short Island Sound to the Old Criminal's Home. Oh, would I love to see Commissioner Gordon's face now. Incredible. I don't believe it. Two of me men saw it with their own four eyes. Catwoman riding in the Batmobile with Batman. They came off the bridge and disappeared in the traffic. The worst has come to pass. Send out an all-points bulletin, Chief O'Hara: "Wanted, dead or alive: Batman, Robin, Catwoman, and Pussycat. " Eh, you, young criminals, you don't know what it's all about. Back in the good old days-- Stow the gab, Little Al. Crime's come a long way since you operate. - Yeah, yeah, here's the million, Little Al. -Oh, thanks, fella. What did you say your name was? Oh, quit yapping and give us the plans to the Mint. Shh. Not so loud. There are a lot of very dishonest persons in here. We're all retired gangsters. You know. Legs Zircon, Frank Nitty-Gritty. Give us the envelope, please. Criminals just ain't genteel anymore. Plans are all here. Good. Great. Where to now, Cat baby? We'll have to lay low at the Catlair till it gets dark. Robin and Pussycat are there already. We're gonna drive east on Beacon till we get to the French Quarter. It's at 13 Rue Madeleine. Yes? Mayor Linseed, we're doing all we can. Hello? Certainly I have all my men on it, Governor Stonefellow. As soon as there's any break in the case, I'll call you back. Gordon. Yes. Yes, I will, sir. Yes, it is terrible. Uh My best to Hubert. An anonymous tip just came into the switchboard with the address of the Catlair. - Should we follow it up? -Let's go. Maybe now All the gray has gone away Maybe now We'll find a way to grow From day to day Loving with the love You say is here to say I will try to meet my vow Take my hand and show me how Turn the key and we may see love Maybe now Oh. Come on, baby, did you miss me? - Well -Are you still madly in love with me, huh? Well How about a little smooch? You're my kind of dame. I hardly even know you, Robin. Kissing is a great way to get acquainted, sweetheart. Robin, I wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression of me. I'm not the type of girl to kiss a boy on the first crime. Close your eyes and pucker, and don't worry about your reputation. Hands up. Don't make a move. - Holy shucks. -You're under arrest. May I change into my street clothes before we go? Oh, all right, go ahead, but hurry. How could they have known the location of my Catlair? Beats me, Cat baby. What's new, Catwoman? Meet us at the Mint at 5 in the morning. - Lay low until then, Mr. Spade. -Right. We're gonna have to find a place to hide out, Batman. Do you remember the way back to the Batcave? Batcave? What's a Batcave? Concentrate, Batman. Perhaps you can remember where it is. Yeah. Yeah, I think I remember. Yeah, that's it. Batcave. What's that? Just a little Bat-Sleep, Catwoman. Twenty winks or so. My name is Pussycat. My rank is criminal, second class. I have no serial number. Now, if you want any more information, flatfoot, see my mouthpiece. It's no use, O'Hara. She won't crack. - What she needs is a good slap on the wrist. -That's enough. You know I'm violently opposed to police brutality. Well, then how are we gonna find Batman? I have an idea. How do we usually find Batman? Call him on the Batphone. Correct. Now, what would happen if we were to trace the line attached to the Batphone? Brilliant, commissioner. - What happened? -You fainted in my arms. Maybe I should take more catnaps. Fantastic. Fantastic. What a base of operations. Yeah, it's a nice little pad, Cat baby. Ah. Oh, Batman, this is wonderful. You and me in our own private paradise. Sounds swingy. Yeah, and Gotham City will swing at our mercy. Is there something you'd like to do, Batman? Yeah, I got your message, Catwoman. Isn't there something that you wanna do? Now that we're standing almost mask to mask this way. Sure, Catwoman. But first, we got the heist at the Mint to think about. Caped crime-fighter to caped crook. What's going on? Someone is trying to trace the line to the Batcave. - Can they do that? -If I let them. It's been tried before, but I'm not gonna let them. There. That ought to throw them off the track for a while, Cat baby. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, back in the rundown apartment of the world's richest and cheapest inventor, Pat Pending One million seven hundred thousand nine hundred and forty-eight. One mil-- Stay right where you are, Batman. Batman? ls Batman here? That's right. And you're he-- Uh, him. Batman. Me? Batman? With this paunch? Ha, ha. You're very clever, Batman. Judging by your appearance, I'd never guess your secret but the Batphone line led us right to you. Oh, this is some sort of trick on Batman's part. I'll say it is. And where is Rudy, your valet? Gone to market. Correction. We have him at police headquarters in his guise as Robin, the Boy Wonder. That's ridiculous. Rudy's 32 years old. And obviously very spry for his age. Come on, Batman. It's all over. No, wait a minute. Get your-- - You'll hear from my lawyer. - Out. I counted that money. I know how much is there. "Dear Alfred. Deliver these Bat-Antidote Pills to Robin at police headquarters. Then have him meet me" Ah. Good show, sir. NARRATOR". It's 5:00 in the morning and all is not well at the Gotham City Mint. It's cold. Here. You want my cape around you? I prefer your arms around me. We're ready when you are, Catwoman. Your timing's incredible! All right, let's get on with it. Now, here's the secret entrance to the place. We're standing in front of the rear door and the entrance is four feet to the left. I don't see anything, Catwoman. You're not supposed to. That's the idea. Hammer. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get down. Get down. It's a new explosive that makes no noise. It's called silentmite. Spade, Marlow, Templar, fill up those sacks with money. Don't take anything under a nickel. Hello, Catwoman. Robin, you escaped. - A lucky star's above you. -But not for you. I'm no longer under the influence of cataphrenic, Catwoman. I'm back to my old, young crime-fighting self. Batman, punch him, kick him. Do something. No. Catwoman, you've been hoist on your own petard. I took a Universal Bat-Antidote before you administered that dreadful drug. I never was under your spell. I was merely acting. But I had to find the chink in the armor of the Mint which I have. Men, dispense with them quickly. - She's gone. -But where? Batman, Robin, forgive my ever doubting you, but I-- There is no time for that, commissioner. Question is, have you see Catwoman? - I did, Caped Crusader. -Where? Just pulled away in the Batmobile. - The Batmobile? -The Batmobile? She must have taken the key to the ignition while my mind was on something else. Holy diversionary tactic. There is one way we can catch her, Robin. Chief O'Hara, may I have the keys to your patrol car? - You insured? -Give him the keys, O'Hara. - Yes, sir. -No ordinary car can catch the Batmobile. Absolutely correct, Robin. Excuse us. We'll never catch her, Batman. Not as long as she keeps going at the Batmobile's top speed. She's heading, it appears, to New Guernsey. Here, take this. The remote control apparatus. Why didn't I think of that? That device can manipulate the Batmobile. The red is for the brakes, white is for acceleration and the green button will turn the car a la izquierda o a la derecha. To the left or right. Threw in a little Spanish on me, huh, Batman? One should keep abreast of foreign tongues, Robin. Must be running out of fuel. - Can you see her? -Yes. Just up ahead. There she is, amigo. Catwoman, come down! You'll have to come up and get me, Batman. What now, mon ami? You heard what she said, Robin. You stay where you are. I'll take care of this. Go get her, Batman. Get her. You're running out of room, Catwoman. You'd better come down. Sorry, Batman, but all my systems are go. Give up, Catwoman. There's no exit. You'll never catch me alive. Ha, ha. It's all over, Catwoman. I could swim for it. You'd never survive the fall. It's a hundred feet down into the river. Anything's better than facing prison again. I'll do everything I can to rehabilitate you. - Marry me. -Everything except that. A wife, no matter how beauteous or affectionate would severely impair my crime-fighting. Then I can help you in your work. As a former criminal, I'd be invaluable. - I can reform. Honestly, I can. -What about Robin'? Robin? Oh, I've got it. We'll kill him. I see you're not really ready to assume a life in society. I guess you're right, Batman. Can't teach an old cat new tricks. Give me your hand. All right, now, get moving. Get moving, all of you. The paddy wagon is waiting for you. Come on. You too. My deepest regrets for ever questioning your actions, Batman. Accepted, Commissioner Gordon. You couldn't have known that my plan was to let Catwoman play out her hand. Oh, yes, Catwoman. An evil genius. You remember your association with her, Boy Wonder? It's all a blur. Like a horrible daymare. I don't think she'll be bothering us anymore. You're probably right, as usual, Batman. Although we've found no trace of her body. I can't conceive of anyone living after a fall from the top of a building like that into west river. -And yet, I can't help thinking that somewhere in that great Catlair in the sky she's looking down and laughing at us. I feel the same way, Batman. She made good her threat, never again to return to prison. Even though it cost her her life. Or at least one of her lives. 
NARRATOR". Atop this skyscraper, the gala opening of a new super-swank restaurant run by an old super-crooked friend. Delighted, Mrs. Van Swank. So charming of you to honor my humble establishment. This way, please. Quack, quack, quack. It's so sweet of you to ask all of us here as your guests. Ha, ha. Guests of the house, I'm glad to say. Warden Crichton felt we should be here. He was so pleased with Penguin having opened this beautiful restaurant. Hi, my friends. - Are you enjoying yourselves? -We certainly are, Penguin. - Ah. -Most inspiring, Penguin. To think that you've mastered this art of haute cuisine in the kitchens of the Gotham City State Penitentiary. It certainly proves that almost nothing is impossible. Well, thank you, Mr. Wayne. Thank you kindly. - I have one small question, though. -Oh? - The strange system for ordering food. -Strange? Yes. Instead of giving the waiter our orders we're required to write them out on individual slips of paper. I was struck by the oddness of that myself. - Why? - Oh, well, efficiency, Mr. Wayne. That's all. - Oh. -Efficiency. - Ha, ha. -Pretty fishy, if you ask me. Chief O'Hara, what kind of way is that to address our generous host? All right, I apologize. Accepted, my dear chief. Oh, my sweet lady. I do hope that you're enjoying your dinner. Oh, yes, everything is lovely. Well, thank you. In that case, I'll just-- Thank you very much. Quack, quack, quack. Oh, merciful heavens to Betsy, my diamond bracelet is gone. Hold it, you crooked bird. Chief O'Hara. All right, open your mitt, Penguin. I saw you lift it. Why, you dratted fellow, unhand me. Good gravy, what a stupid, clumsy crime. Speak up, Penguin. What do you say? - I say faugh. -What? Looks like I'm caught with my feathers down, doesn't it? Chief O'Hara, place Penguin under arrest for grand larceny, first degree. - Yes, sir. A great pleasure, sir. - Wait a minute. Wait, Bruce? What for? Sure and we caught the thieving bird in the act, didn't we? True, Chief O'Hara. However, there's something strange about all this. So strange that wouldn't it be perhaps wise to consult Batman? Batman? On a simple case like this, Bruce? Bruce is right. The simpler a case looks, the more tricky it's apt to be. Faugh, who needs Batman? Take me to prison. That does it. When this pompous, waddling master of foul play all but asks to be arrested Heh. Thanks for the advice. I'll call Batman at once. I think I saw a phone booth in the lobby. Excuse me, Aunt Harriet, I have a call of my own to make. Yeah, police switchboard? This is Commissioner Gordon. Please put this through on the hotline Bat-phone. - Alfred, where are you? -I'm in the Batcave, sir. I was dusting the anticrime computer. In seconds the Batphone will be flashing. Switch it into this line, will you? Very good, sir. Ah, there it flashes now. - Ah, hello? - I'll summon him at once, sir. We're in luck. Batman's at home. Ah, wonderful. - Hello. -Yes, commissioner? A strange and baffling crime at The Penguin's Nest restaurant. - Can you meet me here at once? -It may take a little longer than that. Well, don't worry, Batman. I'll wait for you. - He's on his way. -Splendid. And so are we. I've just lost all my appetite. Do you mind, Bruce? Of course not, my dear. Whatever you say. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Mrs. Cooper. - Good night. Irritating. Most irritating. Just when I'd learned to fly straight, destroyed again. What's your story, Penguin? Well, I was the victim of an irresistible criminal impulse. So that's his defense, temporary insanity. Faugh! Me, plead insanity? Quack. I wouldn't dream of it. Grand larceny, first degree. Another trip up the river. Well, you can't win them all, Batman. That's how the iceberg crumbles. Stranger and stranger. Tell me, commissioner, what kind of business was this restaurant doing? Fabulous. Virtually every millionaire in Gotham City was here tonight. I checked the books. The average tab came to 87 bucks per person. Not counting drinks and the hundred smackers' cover charge. Holy straitjacket. Imagine throwing away a business worth hundreds of thousands for one diamond bracelet. - Incredible. -indeed. - Tell me, Penguin - Hmm? who are your associates in this curious venture? Yes, sir. My associates, Batman. Reading from right to left, Cordy Blue, my chef. Hey, I know that bird. He used to be chief hash-slinger at the state pen. Matey Dee, my head waiter. Astonishing. That fellow did a term up the river as Warden Crichton's personal valet. And last but not least, Chickadee, my hat chick and cigarette girl. Not to mention notorious female bootlegger of untaxed cigars. - Ahem. -An unsavory crew. Well, they're all out on perfectly legal parole. Do you wanna see their papers, Batman? No, thank you, Penguin. You may resume your normal duties. - Commissioner, Chief O'Hara, Robin. -Yeah. You make something of this enigma, Batman? It sticks out like Penguin's nose. For some sinister reason, that pompous bird wants to be arrested. - Good heavens. -But why? I can't imagine, but it's obviously his ploy, stealing that bracelet under your very eyes. And if Penguin wants to be arrested Precisely, Robin. The way to foil his plot is to do just the opposite. Are you certain you know what you're doing, Batman? We'll soon find out, commissioner. Watch. I'm growing restless. Where is that dratted paddy wagon? It's not coming, Penguin. What? We've had a conference, Penguin. We have decided that your impulsive theft of that bauble was merely a case of post-prison nerves. Do you mean that you're not gonna pinch me? Even the rottenest bird deserves another chance. Great quivering jellyfish, what an outrage. What did I tell you? You can't let a felonious felon like me fly free. It's what we're doing, Penguin. Oh, it's impossible. It's monstrous. it's-- Okay, Penguin. - Heh, heh. -No, chief, no! - What? -He was merely baiting us. Don't swallow. Have a heart, chief. Penguin didn't mean any harm. Didn't mean any harm? Hitting a police commissioner in the puss with a pie? No, no, he was simply overwrought with astonishment. Anyone could make the same mistake. Right, commissioner? Of course. Anything you say, Batman. Good night, Penguin. I recommend a cup of warm cocoa to calm your post-prison nerves. Come on. Aw! Faugh! Phooey! Fudgy! I'd like to grab that bird by the neck. I'd like to pluck him. I'd like to prod him all the way to the pen with a pointed stick and-- Toss the rest of this pie in after him. Easy, gentlemen. Control your emotions. Batman's right. We mustn't make a move until we've found out what Penguin's plot is. Which we're going to attempt to do right now. What do you have in mind, Batman? His criminal headquarters must be in the adjoining kitchen. We'll descend to the ground floor via elevator and make our way up the outside wall with our Batropes. Terrific. Let's go. Well, that pestilential pair! The one time in my life that I wanted to get arrested and they pop in and block it. Down, Pengy-poopsie. Don't lose your cool. Faugh, I'm the Penguin. How can a Penguin lose his cool? All right, you've got those food orders, Matey Dee? - Right here, sir. -Quack, quack, quack. Oh, how disgustingly frustrating. Here in my hands the raw material for criminal millions and I can't get into prison to process it. How about driving around and parking in front of fire plugs? - Spitting on a couple of sidewalks? -Faugh, that's fiddlesticks. If a bird can't get arrested by potting a police commissioner with a pie what chance with those piddling ploys? Pengy, look, the handle of your umbrella it's flashing. Heh, heh. So it is. So it is. - What's it mean, boss? -it's my brand-new bat detector. And it means there are bats in this belfry. Our plot is back on the track. Our plot is back on the track. It's sure a shame, Batman. A restaurant with such terrific chow turning out to be a mere front for some criminal scheme. Look at it this way, Robin. That hundred-dollar cover charge is pretty stiff. Penguin's terrific chow is hardly within the budget of the average worker. Gosh, yes, you're right, Batman. All the needy people in the world, the hungry children. Good thinking, Robin. Oh, it's you, Batman. Gave me quite a start. Yes, citizen, you may return to your harpsichord. We're on official business. Oh. They're coming up to our level now. Heading for the window, no doubt. Vicious little eavesdropper. I'll give them something to drop about. Heh, heh. What's the plan, Batman? Routine crime detection. We'll listen in via Bat-microphone and peer through this window. You're a traitor, Mr. Blue. You've betrayed us all. Death to traitors. Great Scott! Holy firing squad! Drat it. Caught red-handed, ain't I? Yes and no, Penguin. Yes and no? Yike! Holy blank cartridge. Precisely, Robin. A sham. How the heck did you know? I observed the recoil of that umbrella gun. Obviously, its angular momentum was inadequate for the mass of a real bullet. So, Penguin, another crude attempt to buy a ticket to the lockup, eh? Faugh, I don't know what you're talking about, Batman. Don't worry, you've succeeded. You're arresting me? As a duly deputized agent of the law that's what I hereby do. It's outrageous. I'll sue you, you piteous upstarts. You have absolutely no right to do this to me. How dare you? How dare you confine a super-criminal of my ilk in this petty city jail all night? -It's all you rate, Penguin. -What? This tawdry, penny-ante pokey on a charge of simulated murder? Simulated murder? Heh. I guess we forgot to tell him. You're in here for violating the sanitary code. - What? -Article 69 B. Forbidding the discharge of umbrella guns in the kitchen of a licensed restaurant. Call your lawyer. Have him look it up. Good day, Penguin. Reflect on your petty sins, you bush-league bird. Incarcerated for a violation of the sanitary code? It's impossible. Why, it's unconstitutional. Here we are. Layout of the state pen, maximum-security wing. That's Penguin's permanently reserved cell. Number P-1. With a connecting door to cell Q-7. Now to find out what criminal presently occupies Q-7. "Cell Q-7. Presently occupied by Barney F. Baxter, alias Ballpoint Baxter. " Yes, Ballpoint. That ugly master of forgery. My hunch is right, Robin. It all fits like my glove. How so, Batman? Remember that curious mode of ordering in Penguin's restaurant? Sure. Instead of telling the waiter what you wanted, you had to write it out. Precisely, Robin. Thus furnishing Penguin with a perfect sample of his patron's handwriting, signature and all. I get it. Penguin planned to take those samples to the state pen and have Ballpoint transfer them to checks. Right, Robin. One of the most brilliant forgery schemes we've ever uncovered. But, gosh, how would Ballpoint lay his mitts on blank check forms in the state penitentiary? Good question, Robin. Let's call Warden Crichton and find out. Warden Crichton, Gotham State Penitentiary. Sorry to wake you from your routine afternoon nap, warden. Batman here with a small but vital question. Yes. Yes, of course. Among your current guests is one Ballpoint Baxter. Is there any way this creature could get his hands on blank check forms? No trouble at all. He'd merely have to order them from the prison print shop. You mean prisoners can order blank check forms from the print shop? Certainly, Batman. The idea is to teach them how to handle their personal finances in a responsible fashion once they leave these grim walls and rejoin society. I see. Another first. Another of your advanced penological techniques. Right. Why? You think it's unwise, Batman? I don't know. I've always had boundless admiration for your efforts, warden but sometimes I just don't know. Good bye. Well, that settles it. We know the Penguin's plot. But how to foil it? Simple. Give him enough rope, send him up the river as he wishes. Sure. Let him get in touch with Ballpoint Baxter. - And after he does -Wham! We pounce. Let's race back to the city, set our trusty trap for Penguin. NARRATOR". But even as the Dynamic Duo speeds from the fabulous Batcave tricky Penguin is making plans of his own with his tiny Penguin radio which was unluckily overlooked when the bird was searched. Quack. Over and out. NARRATOR". Mere minutes later, in the city jail downstairs in the police headquarters building - What do you want? - Amalgamated Caterers. We're delivering this special tricky treat for prisoner Penguin. It's his birthday, officer. Don't tell me. Hacksaw pie. This tricky treat snack was authorized by Chief O'Hara himself, sir. Officer Hoffman, back door. Would you have the chief step down here a moment, please? Thank you. Do you know what this is? This is an electrical metal detector. And if there's a hacksaw blade in this pie, this metal detector is going to detect it. How fascinating. Wow. High-voltage battery pie sure worked the way the Penguin said it would. Quick, get his keys. Chickadee, get his gun. The fools, imagining that a mere city jail could hold a slippery bird like me. - Curious. That door was open. -Maybe Penguin has plans for a jail transfer of his own. -Let's find out, shall we? - Just as I planned. -You planned? Forget it, Penguin. The best-laid plans of birds and men gang aft agley. Plans of bats too, Batman. You're deluded, murderous girl. Will these crooks never learn? At them, gentlemen! At them! Get him! Yeah, get him! Yeah! Die, you fool. You hear me? Oh, you idiot, over there. What are you doing, sleeping? After him, you fink! After him! Stand still, you red-breasted roadrunner. What the devil? Unh! Dynamic Duo, look. Good work, Chickadee. The fiends, they'll use the chief as a hostage. Farewell, Batman and Boy Wonder. Adieu for now. - Forward, feckless flatfoot. -Never. Go with them, chief. Don't resist. They're killers. It's your only hope. Upstairs, Commissioner Gordon's office. Quickly, Robin. Yes? Put him through. It's Penguin. Tell Batman the old abandoned Navy recreation center. The swimming pool. It's his last chance to see Chief O'Hara alive. We're on our way, Penguin. Just one question. Do you promise a fair duel? Robin and I against you and your mangy mob? Of course, Batman. Of course. Fair play is Penguin's middle name. Well, now, you know my amusing scheme? - They come in, we shoot. -Chickadee? I push that trunk containing Chief O'Hara into the pool. Let me out of this infernal hamper, you devils! What's the idea? Let me out! And as the Dynamic Duo's bullet-riddled bodies hit the drink I'll turn on the high-voltage switch, heh-heh-heh at 100,000 volts, electrifying the entire swimming pool. The Batmobile. The bat's last flight. All right, men, to your stations. Chickadee, to the waterslide. 
Batman Another glorious sun drenched day in Gotham City. A fitting day for nuptials, exhibits, or grand theft. "Look out, cops, I here by crown myself. Signed False Face. " Yes, he's back again. That infamous criminal master of trickery and disguise. I am the Princess Mergenberg. What is this I hear? My crown will be stolen? Oh, we'll keep it safe for you, Your Highness. Oh, is so? Then what is this? "All that glitters is gone. " Shouldn't that be, all that glitters is gold? Oh, that's the trademark of False Face, a false quote. 'But the crown is here and safe. ' Not quite, Chief O'Hara It's False Face. In disguised person. Stop! Thief. An inflatable cape. She must be an accomplice. After the man. Police are hot on our trail. Then we'll cool them down. Uh, so False Face is back and up to his old tricks, eh? Disguised as a Princess Mergenberg he and his accomplice the beautiful Blaze tried for the crown. And failed. A false top. Plastic The crown. phony. Utterly worthless. False Face has struck deviously and ruthlessly. Can't we stop this master of devilish disguises? Commissioner, there's only one man living who can unmask False Face. Chief O'Hara, you've said it for all of us. Our only hope is that towering power for right and justice the Caped Crusader.

Uh, ramble in the woods, Aunt Harriet. Uh, nature in the raw, so to speak. Oh. Yes, commissioner. Prepare yourself for a shock. It's False Face. He's struck again. We're on our way. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na Batman And I'm afraid it won't stop for the Mergenberg crown worth a million though it is. This is only the first droplet in a virtual wave of crime. Jiminy, yes. False Face always plans big. Crooked but king size. All too true, Boy Wonder. Messenger here for Batman. Alright, are you Batman, sunny? I am. "I intend to give money "to a defenseless little girl, signed, F. F. " I'd wager that's some sort of a code. It is. False Face always says, the opposite of what he means. Then I intend to give money means, he intends to take money. But what defenseless little girl? Confusing, eh, sunny? Not really. The victim is neither little nor a girl nor defenseless. Opposite of girl's a boy. The opposite of defenseless. . Say, wearing armor? That's it. Of course.

A necessity in the relentless war against crime And speaking of crime, why'd False Face send you here? False Face, challenges you 'to prove that he's committed a crime. ' And if you do, to catch him. And me. It's too late. Blaze. She's as elusive as a flickering flame. I bet that's how she earned her nick name. I warrant, she'll snuff out her fiery criminal career. To the Ladd Armored Car Company, let's go. Are you all assembled? The counterfeit crew ready and on duty, False Face. Good! First, men, I succeeded in lifting the Mergenberg crown. You've done it again, FF. Only the beginning. Blaze, my trusted assistant. . has succeeded in starting of step two of my overall plan. Boys, we are about to double-dizzy Batman and Robin until the Dexterous Duo is duped, decoyed and diabolically destroyed! I've planned the greatest creation of my covert criminal career. False Face will stamp his disguise imaged on all Gotham City. Today Gotham City, tomorrow the world. Three cheers for F. F. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Thanks, men. I know you didn't mean. But back to business. Batman and Robin must go. Batman and Robin, why it isn't often that a simple business man's honored by a visit from the champion of justice and his youthful associate. How can I help you? Rather it's we who can help you, Mr. Ladd. We have reason to believe that one of your armored trucks maybe in danger. Good heavens. I've received word that one of my trucks is late. And it's due at the Gotham City National Bank to pick up a huge shipment of money. I wouldn't be surprised if False Face with his spoke in that set of wheels. - Right. - May I use your telephone? 'Oh, yes, of course. ' Commissioner Gordon, please. This is Batman speaking. Commissioner, There's no time to explain. Dispatch as many spare men as possible to Gotham City National Bank immediately. Mr. Ladd, we'll keep you informed and let you know just as soon as your missing money truck is found. Bless you, Batman. Every law abiding citizen of Gotham City goes with you today in spirit. And if it were possible, in body. Batman and Robin. Come to make a deposit? No, we've come to prevent a withdrawal. By False Face. What? False Face, notorious criminal? Master of disguise? We better put the money in the truck before it's too late, pal. It's already too late. - False Face! - What? Right, that's False Face himself in disguised person. Yeah, what makes you so sure? If's obvious. Only a criminal would disguise himself as licensed bonded guard yet callously park in front of a fire hydrant. It's always the little things. This time it'll cost you a big penalty, False Face. We're going to withdraw you from circulation and deposit you in jail. Well, Boy Wonder, you're interest is over due. Thank you, Batman. . for breaking into my trap. Batman, it's Blaze in the Batmobile. Ugh! Oh, you're so strong. I urge you to abandon this life of crime, Blaze before it's too late. It's already too late, Batman. Holy Houdini! Another deft escape by that master of disguise and deceit. But where can False Face be? Saint's alive! It's False Face. Disguised as me self. Right you are, O'Hara. Welcome, to dreamland. Alright, take off. Everything's under control, chief. Good work. This paper that False Face used to print his message it's rather special. Tensile resistance 85. Holy armored plate. This' about the strongest stuff I've ever seen. As I suspected. it out, Batman. I think a little session with a Bat-analyst might clarify things, Robin. Uh, I-I seem to be short of cash. Alfred, have you a dollar bill? Certainly, sir. - There. - Thank you. By focusing ultraviolet light and applying the principles of controlled fluorescent diffraction we can readily discern. . Why False Face printed his message on the same kind of paper they used to make money. But what use could he make of that paper? To make money, his kind of money, counterfeit money. Will the man stop at nothing? This paper is made by a top secret government process indeed only a few people outside the official bank note printing company are aware that it's the only paper that cannot be counterfeited. Uh-huh! - You found something? - The solution, sir? The sizethe material it all fits. This is official bank note paper. False Face must have penetrated the official bank note printing company. And if he has plans of counterfeiting I'll bet he'll go back there for more special paper. But we will be there before he is. To the Batmobile. Alfred, please inform Mrs. Cooper that we maybe late for supper this evening. Very good, sir. There's nobody here. Not so far. But if someone should arrive I think we should be out of sight. Excuse me, do you have a light? Why, certainly. But smoking is forbidden in the bank note paper room. What department are you in, miss? Removal. You see, my curious friend, we need this paper. Quickly, move this into the trick truck. - Hey, Batman. - And Robin. We've been found out! No, you don't, Blaze. I have the answer to that little thing. I knewsooner or later you would over come my bag of tricks. Let the flat guards clean up these beauties. I wanna interrogate, Blaze. Let me down. You must excuse Chief O'Hara, he has an agonizing toothache and finds it very difficult to speak. I can hardly recognize his voice. - Mmm. - I hope it gets better, chief. She's awakened. Well, miss, it seems we've apprehended you. You? Scarcely. Batman captured me. Only the nemesis of crime could have tripped up Blaze so deftly. Blaze, we've deduced False Face's intent to counterfeit money. We must know where he intends to perform the printing. So, you're in on the counterfeiting caper. Very clever, Caped Crusader. But I know that's only part of his overall plan. 'We must have details of complete plot. ' 'How? Where? When?' I don't know. You? His first lieutenant. That's pretty dim, Blaze. False Face trusts no one and no one trusts False Face. 'Like his name, like his innumerable disguises. ' He's forever in concealment. I know he plans a gigantic coup but I am not in on his plans. Then I'm afraid we're at a dead end. I'll tell you one thing, Batman if there's one force in this world 'that False Face fears, it's you. ' 'And the Boy Wonder of course. ' Many times I've heard him mutter "if it were not for the Caped Crusaders I would be kingpin of the criminal class. " That swine. That False Face is rotten to his concealed corp. Please, commissioner. Even False Face has a conscience somewhere. And can be rehabilitated. . somehow. Uh, that's so true, Batman. For a little moment I was carried away. Batman, you. . You're truly good. And if I can, I'll help you find False Face. Alright, we'll take a chance on trusting you, Blaze. Sorry, I was carried away. Well, let's all be away, after False Face. Right. If I might make a suggestion. Why not let the Dynamic Duo go with Blaze. While I make certain a force of picked police standby. - Capital. - Good thinking, O'Hara. It's nothing. I better be on me way too, commissioner. - I wouldn't wanna lose, Batman. - Right. Can it be? Our Batman and Robin rushing into dire peril. Does Batman know Chief O'Hara is False Face? Can he trust the treacherous Blaze? Clever. Who'd suspect a shutdown of subway station? And it's centrally located for False Face's nefarious plans. I'm sorry we took so long to get here, Batman. But I was unsure of the way. Where to now? Time is of the essence. Oh, good heavens, no wonder I am starved. It's after lunch. Oh, Batman, would you get me a candy bar, please? Candy? Actually fresh fruit is much more helpful. Oh, but there's none here. And there is a candy machine. He's such a gentlemen, you both are. True cavaliers. Oh! False Face. That's quick setting plastic cement. Oh, yes, you're strong, Batman. But a bull elephant couldn't break these bonds. False Face, is this killing necessary? Absolutely. They must be disposed off. The express will be through here inside of five minutes, Batman. Inside of six, no more Batman. Fiend! False Face, you'll regret this! Eventually. Oh, I regret it already. False Face, let's reconsider. Never! No, you don't! Come! Batman, forgive me. Of course, Blaze. Any young girl might follow the wrong impulse. I forgive you. Take a last look. Inside of minutes the Dynamic Duo will nearly be disintegrated debris. Come on! Disaster threatens! Bashed by the BMT? Will the Dynamic Duo dice with death and descend to defeat? Can Batman and Robin break the unbreakable slip out of the chemical clutches escape the epoxy? Keep your Batwings crossed until tomorrow. Same time. Same channel. Same perilous predicament! Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". An apparently peaceful day in Gotham City. But what is this? An armored-car holdup in broad daylight? Bash those guards. Heist that cash. Use your guns. I wanna hear some noise. Quack. We're going to be late for that lecture to the Crime Prevention League. Sounds like we may pick up new material for the lecture. There's nothing like a little on-the-job research, old chum. Lift that loot and tote that cash. Get the loot. Hurry up. You're supposed to be crooks, not a bunch of old women. What are you buttinskies doing here? Just a little scholarly research, Penguin. Stop. Stop this outrageous intrusion. Cease, I say. Cease and desist. Stop, you bumbling buffoons. This is legal, I tell you. It's legal. Have you heard anything about legalized thievery, Robin? Can't say that I have, Batman. I'll wipe those silly smirks off your faces in court. I'll sue you for assault and battery and aggravated interference. Tsk. You're witnessing the final disintegration of a criminal brain, Robin. Years of outlawry have taken their inevitable toll. But he's right about our being in court, Batman. We'll be the prosecution's star witnesses when they try you for armed robbery. Mother machree. What's happening? Nothing now, chief. Lucky we happened to be passing by. Oh, no, Batman, 'twasn't luck. 'Twas a tragedy. Do your duty, O'Hara. Slap the handcuffs on them. They've attacked these innocent citizens. Innocent citizens? What's going on here, chief? I'm afraid he's right, Batman. Look around. Holy CinemaScope. Penguin making pictures? That robbery was just a mock-up. But this permit isn't a mock-up, Boy Blunderhead. It's signed and sealed by the Gotham City Motion Picture Commission. And I'm gonna sue the city for $10 million for failure to provide proper protection. Do you hear that, Batman? Ten million dollars. I hear you, Penguin. And you two are going to jail for aggravated assault and malicious property damage. Do you hear that, Batman? Jail. - Looks like he's got us this time, Robin. -Like rats in a trap. But I'm willing to make a deal. But, Batman, this is a contract for you and Robin to act in Penguin's picture. And you've signed it. Aw, it was blackmail, commissioner. That bird trapped them into it. - Not exactly, chief. -What do you mean, Batman? I wanted to sign that contract, Robin. You knew that robbery was a fake from the start? Yes, I saw the movie equipment as we drove up. I didn't have time to explain but I wanted Penguin to think that he'd trapped us. Why, Batman? When someone like Penguin sets up a movie company you can be sure it's not only film he's after, commissioner. - Sure and that's the truth. -So you signed that contract so we could keep an eye on Penguin. -Precisely, Robin. It's the only way we can stay close to him without arousing his suspicion. What do you think the Penguin's planning, Batman? That's what we'll try to find out, commissioner. He's gone to a lot of expense to establish this film company so we can be sure it's something big. Where is Marsha, Queen of Diamonds? She is two hours late, Miss Patterson. We're trying to locate her, Mr. Penguin. Well, try harder. Time is money in the movie business. - Yes, Mr. Penguin. - Quack. Prop Department? No, Mr. Penguin. This is the Set Department. Eh. Prop Department? Sorry, Mr. Penguin. This is Publicity. Prop Department? Prop Department? - Prop Department? - Yes, Mr. Penguin. Forgot what I wanted you for. Oh, yes. Have you ordered that milk for scene 12 tomorrow? Yes, sir. The tank trucks are arriving now. Twenty-four thousand gallons. Heh. Good, good, good. Mr. Penguin? Yes, Miss Patterson. PATTERSON". Marsha, Queen of Diamonds, is here. Send her in, send her in. Oh, I see that you're at your glittering best, my dear. Thank you, darling. Now, how do you suggest I get across this football field you call an office? Ah, well, just hop into my Pengy-mobile and ride over. Ah. Oh, my! Why, you're even more ravishing than usual, Martha my darling. Skip the compliments, darling. You wouldn't have asked me here if you didn't want something. Yes, I do want something. I want to make you a millionairess. How boring. I'm already a millionairess. Heh, it's true. Then how would you like to be a billionairess? - That's interesting. -And all you have to do is to become my partner in this motion-picture company. Oh, come, now, Pengy. You don't really think there's a billion dollars in filmmaking. Faugh, this motion-picture company is just a front. - A front? -That's right. A front? For what? For what? For the biggest caper ever to be pulled in Gotham City. But I need capital, because this is a very expensive front. - How much capital? -Mm, as much as we can get. About a dozen of those diamonds that you're wearing as a start. And for a dozen of my diamonds, I will be the star of your film, of course. Well, I was thinking of somebody with more-- With more "waah. " If you're thinking of my diamonds, darling, you were thinking of me for the star. The star of my film is Batman. Heh! - Batman? Batman? -Yes. - How did you get him? -Oh, well, my usual bit of cunning chicanery. Along with the Boy Wonder. How's that for a cool one? - Very clever. -Mm? - Pengy, darling. -Yeah? Does Batman have a love scene with the leading lady in your film? Why, of course. Who ever heard of a film without a love scene? Then I shall be your leading lady. Or no diamonds. I might even be able to get my aunt Hilda to whip up a love potion for my lipstick. Your aunt Hilda? Heh! Is that old witch still practicing her black magic? The blackest, darling. And with her help, I'll finally get Batman in my power. Well, that's an additional bit of chicanery. All right. - Is it a deal? -it's a deal. Ah, good. I wouldn't mind winning an Oscar. Heh, an Oscar? Heh! You don't want one of those. My dear, if you play along with me you are liable to win the most coveted award in the entire motion-picture business. You are liable to win a Penguin. Penguin's script looks innocent enough, Robin. An historical spectacle set in the days of ancient Rome. But holy miscasts, Batman. We play a pair of barbarian bandits sentenced to fight as gladiators in the Coliseum. Casting us as bandits would appeal to Penguin's warped sense of humor. He's sure gonna want us jumping through hoops, Batman. And I'm afraid we'll have to jump, Robin. At least until we find out what he's up to. But we don't have to make things easy for him. Take a look at scene 12, on Page 33. Gosh, Batman. What a scene. I think someone connected with the Gotham City Film Decency League should take a look at this script. What do you think, Robin? What do you think, Robin? Oh. I think Penguin's gonna be in very hot water, Batman. That's what I think. This must be it, Robin. - Holy movie moguls, Batman. -Penguin's certainly playing his part to the hilt. Well, if it isn't my two ham actors. The only ham here is wearing a top hat. Tut-tut, Boy Bungler, we can't all be great artists. There it is. An exact duplicate of the famous Tyrrhenian baths in ancient Rome. This is for scene 12, I take it. - You like that scene, eh, Batman? -I think it's in very poor taste, Penguin. Faugh, it's a fantastically magnificent scene. - I wrote it myself. -Obviously. What's the reason for the blindfolds, Batman? The reason is arriving now, Boy Bromide. Hello, darling. Oh, this'll be the most startling spectacle ever to hit the screen. Ha, ha. Wardrobe, where is Miss Marsha's, heh, costume? Heh, heh. Ah, there it is. Very good. Ah! Perfect, perfect. Thank you, thank you. Are you ready to make history with this milk bath, my dear? Ready whenever you are, C. B. The love potion in my lipstick is ready too. Oh. Batman and Robin, how nice to see you. You too, Mrs. Cooper. Could you point out someone called Mr. Penguin to me'? I am Mr. Penguin, madam. And I am Mrs. Harriet Cooper of the Gotham City League of Film Decency. Film Decency? What are you doing here, Mrs. C? We have read your script, Mr. Penguin. And we cannot approve the scene which you apparently are about to shoot. This is outrageous. As the leading entrepreneur of Gotham City I will not submit to having one page of my masterpiece enfeebled. And we will not submit to such bullying tones. Kindly remove your Victorian mind from my set, Mrs. C. Only when you remove this morbid scene from your film. Think of the children. I am thinking of the children, madam. Look at this. Look at this here. Twenty-three thousand quarts of homogenized milk here. Fortified with vitamin C. I tell you, this whole scene is bursting with minerals and vitamins. This scene is bursting with other things as well. Oh, you know, I suspect this is your doing, masked meddlers. You're always poking your proboscis into other people's business. Decency is everybody's business, Penguin. All right. All right, we will out the scene. And instead, we will do scene 43. Get ready, Marsha. And you, Batman, take your place for scene 43. Scene 43, that's the one where you and Marsha-- Yes, I know, Robin. But I'll have to do it. I trust you're going to enjoy this scene, Batman, darling. I made a bargain with Penguin, and I never break my word. Bargain? Why, half the men in the world would fight to be kissed by Marsha, Queen of Diamonds. They certainly wouldn't have to fight me. What an appalling lack of enthusiasm, darling. But don't worry, I have enough enthusiasm for both of us. Lights. Camera. Action. Cut it. That's not good enough. Batman, I want you to put some "grah" into it. We'll do it again and again and again. Once is enough, you feathered fraud. Tut-tut, Boy Bluenose. Penguin is a perfectionist. I'll do it a hundred times if it's necessary. And it will be necessary. All right, action. Oh, Bruce, your lips are terribly chapped. It's a mild case of windburn, Aunt Harriet. You see, this afternoon, Dick and I took an open bus tour through the Wayne Animal Sanctuary. Well, I'm going to get you some salve for those lips. Just in case a pretty girl wants to kiss you. Boy, I'll bet you'll never wanna kiss another girl as long as you live, Bruce. I wouldn't go so far as to say that, Dick. You're jumping to a rash conclusion. Aw, you looked like you were putting up quite a struggle, all right. I think there was some kind of potion in her lipstick. - Potion? -Yes. I think a love-inducing elixir of some sort. No wonder your lips are chapped. It took a great amount of concentration to combat its effectiveness. Good. Speaking of the immediate future why do you think Penguin is shooting tomorrow's scene at the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities? He claims he wants to use the museum as a background for his films. But I suspect he has something bigger in mind. Shouldn't we do something? That museum is full of priceless and irreplaceable art. I have done something about it, Dick. I went to the museum and planted Bat-homing devices on every object of art. Ah, Alfred. Have you been keeping an eye on the Bat-radar scopes? Yes, sir. And so far the signals from the Bat-homing devices indicate that all the objects of art are still in the museum. Hmm. I suspect some of the objects will be moved before the night is over. And we'll know exactly where Penguin's taken them. So far, our overall plan is working like a charm, Bruce. So far, Dick. So far. Didn't you think I was magnificent in that love scene, darling? Well, you were certainly better than the potion in that lipstick. That left Batman colder than an iceberg. Yes, Aunt Hilda obviously forgot to put enough oomph into it. - Anyway, your plan is working so far. -What do you mean, so far? A Penguin plan is money in the bank. Money in the bank is no good to us, darling. Our problem is getting it out of the bank. Don't worry, it'll be out of the bank and in our hands soon enough. You see, stage one is already in progress. Right now my men should be at the Museum of Antiquities. And stage two is likewise under control. Now for stage three. I will need another love potion from your aunt Hilda. And one that'll really, really work this time. I'll see what I can do, darling. In the meantime, you'll have to tell me what stage three is. - Tell me. -No, I never trust a woman with a secret. And if you're nothing else, Marsha, you're certainly a woman. A woman with diamonds, darling. Or would you rather return my collateral to me? No, no. That's extortion, Marsha. You should know, darling. You should know. - Hello, Aunt Hilda. -Hello, dearie. What is that? Mortimer, say hello to Marsha. Aunt Hilda, have you been robbing graveyards again? Oh, no, dearie. I left off that 20 years ago when I was chemistry professor at Vassar. Until I quit. Don't you mean until you were fired? A term I find most unappealing, dearie. Speaking of things unappealing where did you get that? I left one of the potions in the caldron overnight and next morning, there was Mortimer. He's really quite friendly. How are you doing with your other potions these days, Aunt Hilda? Other potions? That one you put in my lipstick was a complete failure. Well, that was because I ran out of chameleon tongues, dearie. - But if you want something really strong-- -I do, I do. I was just about to whip up one of my bests. The old toad potion. My very strongest. Oh, dear. I'm afraid I'm out of old toads too. Can't you substitute some new toads? It would never work, dearie. We've just got to get some more old toads. It doesn't look as if Penguin took anything, Batman. No it doesn't, Robin. All our homing devices seem to be in place. But I'm still suspicious, Robin. Suspicious of what, Caped Codger? Don't tell me you're suspicious of the Penguin tampering with these priceless works of art. The thought did cross my mind. What, a great filmmaker like myself stooping to a petty theft? Why, that's ridiculous. What's ridiculous is thinking you're a great filmmaker. I write the lines around here, Boy Blowhard. You stick to the script. Speaking of which, your big scene is coming up. I must see to it that everything is, heh, prepared. - Batman, thank heaven you're here. -What's wrong, Mr. Tamber? The museum's priceless collection of 15th-century chain-mail armor, it's gone. That's impossible. Our Bat-homing-- There is one factor I could've overlooked, Robin. The metal alloy in that armor could've set up a magnetic field which blocked our homing transmission. You have to get them back, Batman. That unique alloy was invented by the great master Benvenuto Violini. Violini. Yes, he made the chain-mail armor out of it. We'll try our best, Mr. Tamber. But I think you should move out of this room. There could be some trouble here. I think Batman has discovered the missing armor. We'd better start this scene early. All right, Batman, a light rehearsal. Action. I have a strange feeling Penguin is going to make this a very realistic scene, Robin. If he wants realism, we'll give him realism. Detail, halt. Prepare to fight. One, two. That's it. Skewer the scrofulous scullion. Spear him like a cucumber. Quack, quack! That's not in the script, Batman. I'm directing this scene. Maybe we'll get you in the scene, Penguin. Those costumed cutups are slicing my finks to ribbon. Uh Quack. Shield your eyes, Robin. Ah. Now we'll give those two-bit actors a piece of real action. This catapult will hurl you through the sky and across Gotham City. I'm sure you'll make a big splash at the other end of your journey. And your last moments on Earth will be recorded for posterity by those two cameras that I've strapped to your legs. And I'll show the film at a special premiere for the Benefit of the Amalgamated Crooks of Gotham City. The In-Flight Motion Pictures Benefit of Penguin Productions Unlimited. Good flight, masked missiles. We'll watch from a better vantage point. Farewell. 
NARRATOR". Night, the cloak for sinners, draws its dark folds over Gotham City where the Riddler hides out in a little-used gymnasium. Me? Throw the biggest fight of my career tonight? - In Gotham Square Garden? I won't do it. - Ah? Oh, yeah. - I won't go into the ring if the fight's fixed. -Yes, you Will, Kid Gulliver. Yes, you will. Ha, ha. I have a riddle for you. What do many boats, shovels, laundries, whistles and hot showers have in common? Steam. Put him in the steam room and shrink him down to size. After Kid Gulliver, what, Riddler? Get rid of every other top prizefighter in town, Betsy, that's what. Plus that contemptible crime-fighter, Batman then control all the prizefighting in Gotham City once and for all and everywhere else. That's a big order. How are you gonna do it? With an ace I have up my sleeve, and what an ace. But for starters when is the top of a mountain like a savings account? Go on, Riddler. When it piques one's interest. Kid Gulliver? Down for the count in the third? It's hard to believe, Bruce. As chairman of Gotham City Boxing Commission I'm gonna call an emergency meeting. It looks like undesirable elements have once again infiltrated the manly art of self-defense. NARRATOR". And making off with the box office receipts. Riddle me this. When does a painter use a trigger instead of a brush? When he's a stickup artist. - I'd like two seats for tomorrow's-- -That box, it's blinking. Help! Police! Help! And you caught no glimpse of the robbers, Batgirl? No. I heard the cashier scream, called Commissioner Gordon's office and brought this box directly here. It's lucky you were in the vicinity of Gotham Square Garden. Yes. Luck is an important weapon to a woman crime-fighter, Batman. Ah. As I suspected. This little blinking device is merely an added touch to pique our curiosity. Sounds like a trick of Riddler's. Indeed. He's back. What's in the box? Apparently, just some metal filings. And this note. "Who rules the ring? No prince, king or raja. Look for a clue on the walls of Khafajah. " Ah. Riddler, indeed. Returned to tease, taunt, and torment us again. "Look for a clue on the walls of Khafajah. " What could he mean this time, Batman? Khafajah was a famous temple in what was the land of Mesopotamia, Robin. My daughter, Barbara, studied the history of Southwestern Asia in college, Batman. Perhaps if I called her, she could be of some-- What, uh? What happened to Batgirl? - Begorra, she's gone. - Into thin air. Her particular brand of vanishing cream another weapon in her arsenal. Commissioner Gordon. Yes? He what? Well, Batman's right here. I'll tell him at once. That was the boxing commissioner. He was-- He was calling about Kid Gulliver, who's vanished. Disappeared completely while his seconds were carrying him down to his dressing room. That shot I gave him won't wear off for a week. - What was in that shot, boss? -A little riddle juice, Kayo. Gentlemen, if we had our choice of laps to sit on right now, which would we choose? Laps? To sit on? Kid Gulliver's temporary lapse of memory. Take him away. Here are the burnooses, Riddler. And my latest news break. "Mushy Nebuchadnezzer unchallenged champion of Southwestern Asia's boxing world arrived in Gotham City tonight. Ready and willing to take on any and all comers. " Mushy Nebuchadnezzer? Stroke of your usual feminine genius, Betsy. Well, then slip into your burnoose, Riddler because Mushy Nebuchadnezzer is going to appear on my midnight sports telecast. Sorry to bother you at this time of night, Miss Gordon. We would've entered the building by more conventional means but we didn't wanna startle the tenants. -Oh, I understand. I was expecting you. - Oh? -My father called. Won't you come in? - Thank you. -You want to know about the famous temple of Khafajah? -Yes. As I recall, some strange scrollwork was found on the walls of that temple indicating men used fists to fight long before the supposed beginnings of boxing in ancient Rome and Greece. Holy hieroglyphics. How would the Riddler know that, Batman? The mind of a criminal like Riddler's is a sponge which soaks up many strange facts, Robin. Riddler is an old archenemy of ours, Miss Gordon returned to try to outwit us and bilk the good citizens of Gotham City. That riddle he sent us, perhaps we should examine it again. "Who rules the ring? No prince, king or raja. " Could he mean the prizefighting ring? We should've thought of that ourselves. Up until tonight, Kid Gulliver was the champ. - Perhaps Riddler himself is trying to take over. -That punctuated pipsqueak? Barbara. Barbara, it's I. It's my father. Well, tonight seems to be my night for gentlemen callers. I was walking home, took a chance the Caped Crusader would be here. Kid Gulliver's been found, Batman. Outside Gotham Square Garden but he remembers nothing. Uh, an injection of some drug seems to have affected his memory. Then it will do us no good to talk to Kid Gulliver. We might take a look at Gotham Square Garden. Maybe we'll find something. Thank you, Miss Gordon. You've been great help. Batman. It's little enough to do for so courageous a crime-fighter. I thought I'd catch the last of Betsy Boldface's midnight sports telecast. Betsy Boldface seems to have quite a hold over you. She's as good as any man would be on that job. - Mushy Nebuchadnezzer. -Yes. Southwestern Asia's unchallenged champion and also one of the most colorful prizefighters in the world. For instance, Mushy, tell us, just what do you eat? Tamarisk berries, bulbul bird eggs and licorice. But, uh, only licorice native to my country. BETSY". What liquids do you drink? Just, uh, camel grass juice. What else? Enough of that. He sounds like Southwestern Asia's unchallenged nut. NARRATOR". While in the box office of Gotham Square Garden We saw your car parked outside. Commissioner Gordon said that you might be here looking around. All you all right, chief? What car? Who's Commissioner Gordon? Riddle me this, Dynamic Dullheads. What have the following in common? Hemming, basting, purling and tacking? Holy blackout. A unique trick of Riddler's. Now you see him, now you don't. He's gotta be someplace in this building. Unfortunately, we don't have time to go after him. Chief O'Hara needs help and quickly. Hemming and purling, basting and tacking are all words related to needlework. You think they gave Chief O'Hara the same injection as they gave Kid Gulliver? I'll take Chief O'Hara down to headquarters. You follow in the Batmobile. Come, come, chief. You know something, Charlie all I could see under that burnoose was Mushy Nebuchadnezzer's chin and it didn't look much like a Southwestern Asiatic chin to this student of history. And there's something about that Betsy Boldface. I'm afraid Batman and Robin are headed for more than just Gotham Square Garden. Maybe Batgirl should investigate the local source of tamarisk berries bulbul bird eggs, licorice, and camel grass juice. NARRATOR". So it's across her bedroom in a flash to the secret Batgirl nook where Barbara Gordon makes her dazzling change to Batgirl. And into action on her Batgirl Cycle. And shortly, back in Riddler's little-used gymnasium. I've picked up more than Mushy Nebuchadnezzer's tamarisk berries - Tamarisk? -and bulbul bird eggs - Bulbul? -and licorice and camel grass juice at an Asiatic delicatessen. -Ah. - Riddler, Batgirl is on my trail. -Batgirl? Yes, Batgirl. I saw your phony broadcast tonight, Riddler. Masquerading as Mushy Nebuchadnezzer. What's your scheme? - What do you have up your sleeve this time? -Up my sleeve, Batgirl? Riddle me once. What's most alluring, when it's lowest or highest? When it's in the air or in a hole? When it's served you, yet you can't touch it? An enchanting ace. Put these earmuffs on. Siren, let her have one of your most stunning notes. What happened? It didn't work. It didn't work. Well, I've never tried my note two octaves above high C on a woman before. - And she won't try it again. -Get her. Good. Now, toss her into the steam room as you did Kid Gulliver. Batgirls wilt just as quickly as other women. Ha, ha. Like a dream. It worked just like a dream, Betsy. I thought my broadcast would put the Dynamic Decimal Points on your track. But Batgirl will work just as well. Even though Siren's stunning note didn't work on her. But it didn't work on me, either. I didn't have the earmuffs on. Well, it's never failed to put men under my spell, Riddler. And at my command. Well, then men, you shall have. Three. Top prizefighters in the country waiting outside right now to be dazed by your dazzling decibel. And with them in my power and Batman KO'd once and for all I shall rule the ring. This is Jerry Quarry, Mushy. A contender for the heavyweight title. Oh, yes. Jerry, contend with this. All right, Riddler, they're under my spell. They'll obey any order now. Good. Take them into the steam room. And turn the heat up and find out how Batgirl is doing. Now. Now, to put Batman under my spell. I too have plans for Batman. - And Commissioner Gordon. -A good parlay. A good parlay. Thank you, Siren, from the bottom of my burnoose. - Batgirl's gone, boss. -Gone? Gone? - Gone. -No! - Somehow, she got out. -No, no, no. - She must've went up a vent. -No, no, no. - Would you like a shot of camel grass juice? -No! No, no. Oh, what's looser than a thread, a fish, flying ribbons? A woman's tongue. Possibly Batgirl's. I've got to get on some provocative riddles if I'm going to coax Batman into the ring with Mushy Nebuchadnezzer. NARRATOR". The next morning, Batman and Robin reply to a summons on the red phone. I have called Batman, Barbara. But I called you too because I needed someone to talk to until he arrived. Oh, I know you'll be late at the library but with Chief O'Hara still in a state of amnesia, I'm lost. That's all, just lost. The whole city is aroused over Kid Gulliver's condition. Plus, the strange disappearances of three of the contenders and I'm snowed under with riddles sent here to this office in care of Batman. Listen to this nonsense. "What do bells, curtains, twins and hair have in common?" Ha, ha. That's easy, Daddy. - Easy? -Something like his riddle of last night: "Who rules the ring?" Uh, ring? Bells ring out. Curtains ring down. Twins are perfect ringers. - And hair often comes in ringlets. -Well, smart girl. Yes. All right, then let's see you get this one. Ahem. "Any aggressor should beware his successor. " Well, it isn't a very good rhyme, but it must have something to do with Nebuchadnezzer. So he's still taunting Batman, eh? "Aggressor, successor. " Ah. Sounds like a challenge to me. - Challenge? -Yes, Batman. To meet Mushy in the ring. Commissioner Gordon. Yes, he's right here. This call's for you too. - Hello? -Riddle me this, Batman. What are the chilliest 12 inches in the world? It's the Riddler. The chilliest 12 inches in the world? Cold feet. Excellent. What suit of cards lays eggs? One that's chickenhearted. Now, listen to this, Riddler. - Sticks and stones may break my bones-- -Now, you âstem to me, Batman. My line is plugged into radio station GTCR. That means that all of Gotham City has heard you called, ha, ha, a coward. That's it, commissioner. Regardless of who Mushy Nebuchadnezzer may be or what Riddler is up to, regardless of private or public image one thing I cannot abide is being called a coward. You may inform all the news media that I will meet the champion of Southwestern Asia in Gotham Square Garden tonight. Phil, take over for a minute. I'll be right back. You make an excellent second second, Alfred. I trust no one will penetrate my disguise, sir. - But I think perhaps you'd better call me Gus. -Gus. Holy missing relatives. Look who's sitting down behind Commissioner Gordon. Mrs. Cooper, how nice to see you. My daughter, Barbara. - Your daughter? How do you do, my dear? -Hello. Oh, commissioner, I've been such a wanderer. I just got back from the New Hebrides this evening. I didn't want to let the boys know. I wanted to surprise them. And there was nobody home, not even Alfred. And then I heard that Batman was fighting this Mushy Nebuchadwhosis-- -Ha, ha. And you know me. I love a fight. As I thought, it's Riddler. This is ridiculous. He's smaller than you are. Okay, fellas. I want a good, clean fight. Touch gloves. Batman, what eats crow, yells uncle, and tosses sponges? - A loser. And I'm not a loser, Riddler. -Oh? Spritz him, Riddler, with the metal filings in your gloves. - Betsy's under the ring with a magnet. -Go on, get him. - Stick it out, stick it out. -Finish him off, come on. Wait, wait, wait. What--? Holy sudden incapacitation. Yes. The drawing power of this fight seems to have concentrated beneath the ring. Aw, ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha! Mother Machree, what's happening? Batman's feet seem to be magnetized to the canvas. Excuse me, I have something in my eye. NARRATOR". Through a door, as Barbara Gordon and seconds later, making her startling reappearance as Batgirl. - Batgirl. -Yes, Betsy Boldface. We meet again. Ladies and gentlemen, riddle me this. When is a prizefight like a beautiful lady? Answer: when it's a knockout. Something went wrong. Let's get out of here. - What happened to you? -She happened to me. Get her. Batman's on our tail. Let's get out through the steam room. - Any final riddles, Riddler? -Yes. What do you throw away that keeps returning? A boomerang. Correct. And I'm a boomerang. And I shall be back. Well, that winds that up, fellow crime-fighters. Thanks to Batgir-- - She's gone. -Yes, but this time I saw where she went. Through that transom. And her Batgirl Cycle's parked in the back alley. Let's follow her. Let's find out who she is. No, no, old churn. Let us respect her disguise as she respects ours. - I guess you're right. -Some camel grass juice, sir? Gosh, Batman, this camel grass juice is great. Beware of strong stimulants, Robin. - Yes, Bonnie. - There's a Miss Circe out here to see you, commissioner. Lorelei Circe. Circe? Circe. Name doesn't ring a bell, but send her in. Miss Circe, what can I do for you? It's what I can do for you, commissioner, that really counts. NARRATOR". Will the Siren succeed in the plan she has for Batman and Commissioner Gordon? Will her purring parlay pay off? Watch for the stunning surprise on the next episode. 
NARRATOR". Another dazzling day in Gotham City a metropolis which prides itself on family fidelity, paternal devotion and most particularly, its annual Mother of the Year presentation. And so it gives me a great deal of pleasure to present the winner of this year's Mother of the Year Award. Such a dear little lady. Won't you say a few words, Mother of the Year? Why, Mrs. Chairlady, I'd be happy to say a few words. Stick them up! Now, calm down. Calm down, ladies. I wanna introduce my boys. Pretty Boy. Machine Gun. And Mad Dog. - And now, ladies-- -Ma. Oh, yeah, my fourth child, a girl, Legs. All right, boys, let's relieve these ladies of a few extra pounds. - Ha-ha-ha. -Thanks for letting me come along, Ma. I don't know whether I should've. Girls just don't belong in crime. Ma, I'll prove myself. Hand it over, fat lady. I'm not fiat. I'm not, I'm not. The earrings. Get the ring. The money, the money in the purse. Go on, boys. This is bad news, Chief O'Hara. Ma Parker and her boys in Gotham City. Bad news, commissioner? It's disaster. They've terrorized almost every other city in the country. But they've never operated in our fair metropolis before. Now, there's been a special reason for that, chief? Yes, sir. We've got the finest law enforcement organization there is. Chief O'Hara, let's give credit where credit is due, shall we? L just did. I mean Batman and Robin, they're the ones she's always feared. And you don't think she's frightened of them anymore? I wouldn't venture to guess but I do know it will take the Dynamic Duo to end her career once and for all. I'll call him, sir. Gosh, Bruce, Greek is still Greek to me. It's Greek to a lot of Greeks too. Heh. It's one of the world's oldest, most important, most beautiful languages. It may be, Aunt Harriet but can't we take a breather and work out in the gym for a while? But the mind needs exercise too, Dick. Well, my mind is getting muscle-bound. There's an old saying, Dick. A sound mind and a sound body. A worthy goal. Now, what do you wanna do first? - Parse, conjugate, or decline? -Decline. -It's the Batphone, sir. -Hm? Yes. It just occurred to me, Dick. Commissioner Gordon is a Greek scholar of note. He may be able to tell us more than books and blackboards. I'd like to talk to him. Excuse us, Aunt Harriet. You know, Bruce comes up with such bright ideas. Indeed, madam, yes. Yes, commissioner? Batman, a crisis. The infamous Ma Parker has invaded our fair city. We're on our way. To the Batpoles. Why? This criminal record is incredible. How, gentlemen? How has this Ma Parker remained at large? She's crafty, Batman. She's clever. But most of all, she's motherly. You mean toward her four sons? Three sons and a daughter, Batman. The girl, if anything, is even more dangerous than the boys. Although Ma Parker only likes boys. In fact, she calls every hoodlum her boy. She's the greatest mother of them all. Surely, a woman with her maternal instinct can't be all bad. Don't let false sentiment trap you, Batman. Ma Parker may also be the greatest menace of your career. Holy rocking chair. Gordon speaking. What? Yes. Fine. The Gotham police have surrounded their hideout on Cherry Blossom Road. Ma Parker and her family are inside. Come on, Robin. Let's help a little old lady across the street and in to the penitentiary. All right, Ma Parker, we know you're in there. We've got the house surrounded. Hey, Ma, did you hear that? You eat your vegetables, Machine Gun, or you ain't gonna get no dessert. Oh, Ma, I hate carrots. They're good for your eyes, son, you eat them, help you shoot straight. Hey, Mad Dog, that's my grapefruit. You want it? Take it. Stop the horseplay, you two. Ma Parker, you haven't got a chance. Surrender or we're coming after you. Ma, do you think they mean it? You just eat your supper, boys. I'll take care of them. - We haven't got a chance. -We have if we stand in the direct line of fire. Ma Parker and her boys are known as the worst shots. Yeah, maybe. Here come the Cape Crusaders. Well, well, guess who's paying us a social call, Batman and Robin. Just like I hoped. Nincompoops, how many times I have to tell you, Batman and Robin can't hurt us. They can only help us. Oh, gee, that's right. I almost forgot. Good old Ma. You mean good old Dynamic Duo? It's no use, Batman. Ma Parker has an arsenal in there. It would take an army to get her out. Holy gunpowder, Batman. What can we do? Remember, Robin, they say an army travels on its stomach. - I get it, Batman. We crawl on the roof. -Precisely, Robin. This time, it won't be necessary to use Batropes. What's happening, Ma'? Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the house. Where are they now, Ma? Oh, they're crawling along the drain pipe. Boy, that was some meal, Ma. Oh, they've reached the window. Hey, Ma, what's for dessert? Apple pie. Oh, they're coming through it. They sure are. - Batman, look out for Ma Parker. -This Batmagnet should do the trick. Legs, clear the table. Go get him, boys. My babies. My boys, my poor boys. What have you done to them, Batman? Sorry, Ma Parker, violence begets violence. Oh, Pretty Boy, you're bleeding. You're bleeding. It's only ketchup. A bottle fell on him. Oh, Batman, please, please don't hurt my boys. The law will see to their punishment, not I. But, Batman, I'm only a poor mother all alone trying to raise my little brood the best I know how. I didn't mean any harm. I'm sure the law will deal with you mercifully, Ma. Oh, thank you, Batman. I always knew that you had a heart. Look, Batman and Robin have captured her. Ohh. Oh, don't shoot, officers. Don't shoot this old gray head. Why, she looks like my own mother. I never meant to harm anybody. I'm just a poor mother trying to get along. Take that, you sentimental fools. Holy hairdo. She's got a smoke bomb. Come on, children, come on. Batman, they're getting away. Not if I can help it. One down, four to go, Robin. There they go. - Let's go after them, Batman. -it's no use. We couldn't even find the Batmobile in this smoke. At least we got one of their gang. We would've had them all if I hadn't let my emotions lead me astray. Mark my word. I won't rest until Ma Parker and her brood are in Gotham State Penitentiary. Neither will Ma, Batman. Ha-ha-ha! I just programmed the crime computer, Robin. It contains the information about Ma Parker and her activities. Holy forecast, Batman. - Can it really tell us where she'll strike next? -Criminals invariably follow a pattern, Robin. Remember Archer and the way he worked. I've designed this computer to trace that pattern electronically. You think of everything. When fighting crime, even the most minute detail must not be ignored. Ah. There's the answer. The crime computer points out that Ma Parker's been robbing wealthy society gatherings. The box office at the horse show. The Flower Guild Tea Dance. A wedding reception at the Gotham Plaza Hotel. That may be interesting and very valuable but how can we tell where she's gonna strike next? In my everyday role as Bruce Wayne, I receive many invitations, Robin. Today's social calendar includes the monthly meeting of the Gotham Breakfast Club. But that's a little early even for Ma Parker. There's the mayor's luncheon for that visiting prince. But that's too heavily guarded. And there's a special society gathering, a benefit at the Bijou Theater this afternoon. It's been well publicized. Now, that event may attract a wealthier crowd. Bingo. Maybe we better catch that matinee. Yes, Robin. We're off to the movies. Good work, boys. That was a four-star performance. Look, Ma. Let's get out of here. Sonny, would you give a poor old lady a lift. Beat it, Granny. Why, is that any way for you to talk to your elders? Sorry, ma'am. I've got a slight headache. So now, I wanna pick up a pill. Get in the back, kids. - Okay, Caped Crusader, you got me. -All right, let's see what's in that case. - A violin. -Yeah, Ma wants me to take lessons. You'll have plenty of time to practice in the penitentiary. Everything is going great, Ma. Just like you planned. I told you to wear a sweater in the air-conditioned theater, Mad Dog. - Now you'll catch a cold. -I'm okay, Ma. That reminds me, I've gotta send Pretty Boy's long underwear. And some of my special nutty cookies, huh? I hear the food's good in the pen, Ma. Well, we're soon gonna find out, huh? We've scoured the city, Batman, no sign of that truck. There's one more place we might try, Robin. Remember what Ma Parker said before she got away about a slight headache? - You think she went to a drugstore? -Perhaps, but not for a headache tablet. May I suggest you lock your car, sir. Your local police are asking all Gotham City-ites to cooperate in their current campaign. You might place this sticker on your bumper. All right, folks, come on. Just keep filling up the jar, it's for a worthy cause. Come on, come on. This is disgraceful. Why should I give you my money? Because we give you trading stamps, dearie. Come on, hand it over. Looks like almost three grand, Ma. Well, well, you're good for something even if you are a girl. Aren't you glad Ma made you study arithmetic? I always say there's no substitute for a good education. Speaking of arithmetic, Ma, look. One and one makes two. Her aim is not too good if the target is moving. Let's keep it moving. Look out, Batman. Holy greeting cards. He's out cold. You saved us, Batman. Yes, but where is Ma Parker? She got away while you were catching that one. Thank you, Batman. Thank you, Robin. At least we're taking her boys out of action. Yes, but remember what Commissioner Gordon said. Ma Parker's girl is more dangerous than her three boys. Her legs sort of reminded me of Catwoman's. You're growing up, Robin. Remember, in crime-fighting, always keep your sights raised. I don't like admitting this, Robin. But even the crime computer can't tell us where Ma Parker's hideout is. In this mechanized age, it's a wonder that more machines don't get just as tired as people. I mean, they have a goof or two coming. She has to be someplace, and someplace in Gotham City where she can more or less melt into the background. Holy camouflage! Exactly! Now, where would an old lady go? These days, just about anywhere. Look at Aunt Harriet, the way she gets around. But Ma Parker's different. I suspect she'd be, at this point, making a conventional and an orthodox move. An old people's home is conventional and orthodox. But it's only for old people. You're not only growing up, Robin. But you've just proved that the human brain is the best thinking machine ever devised. Gosh, maybe those Greek lessons are helping after all. And what could be more orthodox than the Gotham City Old Folks Home on the outskirts of the city? I know it's a needle in a haystack. It's a leap in the dark. - Well, we leaped before, Batman. -Let's go. Here's a picture of Ma Parker. Have you seen her? Why, she looks just like Mrs. Smith. Then we found her. But it couldn't be. Mrs. Smith's an invalid. - I'm sure she's not the one you want. -Would you point her out? Why, yes. She should be coming down the corridor right now. It sure is nice and quiet, here. Isn't it, Ma? So relaxed and pretty. I don't think it's so relaxed and pretty. Look. - Look. -it's Batman and Robin. I surrender. Not yet. What a nincompoop. - I knew I should never trust a girl. -But, Ma-- How many times I have to tell you, we can't make it look too easy. Holy Wernher von Braun! Look at that wheelchair go! How is she gonna get through the wall? She didn't. All right, all right. Batman, I give up. I knew it was a mistake ever to come to Gotham City. You're old enough to know that crime doesn't pay. Oh, you're a very bright boy, sonny. And also a very good boy. You sure all this running around is good for you? And you think you get plenty of rest and nourishment, huh? Let's go, Ma Parker. I can't help thinking that something's wrong. NARRATOR". Sometime later at Gotham State Penitentiary Congratulations, Batman and Robin. Once again, you put vicious criminals where they belong. The real work is only beginning, commissioner. The work of rehabilitation. -Isn't that right, Warden Crichton? -I'm glad you see it that way, Batman. You see, Ma Parker, boys, you too, miss. Our job at Gotham State Penitentiary isn't to punish you. It's to help you become useful citizens again. To make you understand that crime really doesn't pay. Oh. Not in Gotham City anyway. Thanks to the Dynamic Duo. Why, half this prison is filled with crooks they've caught. That's right. The most notorious, the most clever criminals are right here. But even if they were to escape we know that Batman and Robin would bring them right back. - We'd better be going, warden. - Well, thank you again, Batman, Robin. You've made me proud of my profession. Warden. All right, guards, take them to their cells. Didn't you hear me? I said, take Ma Parker and her children back to the cell block. What's the matter with you? What's going on around here? I'll tell you what's going on around here, warden. We're taking over your prison. Ha-ha-ha! What? I've been planning this for months. One by one, I've been substituting members of my gang for your guards. And now, the prison belongs to us. Ha, ha. Why, this is incredible. I don't believe you. Guards, help. Guards. It's no use, warden. Ha, ha. Ahh. So you wanted Batman and Robin to capture you? Sure thing. Why, warden, we're gonna use Gotham State Pen for our own purposes. You said you got some of the smartest crooks in the country right here. And now, we got you here too. You can't prevail. Not with Batman and Robin around. What are you planning? Why, warden, it's already planned. One of your trustees is taking care of Batman right now. Ha, ha. I was just looking at your great Batmobile engine, Batman. It does the job. Warden says his car won't do more than 70 on the road. I bet you could do a hundred. That's right, warden. When the speedometer hits 60, the Batmobile blows up. 
NARRATOR". The great metropolis of Londinium, mighty capital of the Old World is enjoying another of its famous crystal-clear days. But in the queen's private museum in Chuckingham Palace something's rather foggy about Lord Marmaduke Ffogg of Ffoggshire and his sister, Lady Penelope Peasoup. But what are these twisted twigs of Londinium aristocracy up to? Purloining Her Majesty's priceless snuffboxes? And then covering their tracks with Marmaduke's own man-made fog? And shortly, in Commissioner Gordon's office, on the other side of the Atlantic If you wish, Mr. President, I can handle this myself. I'm going to Londinium this week for an International Police Commissioner's Conference. Only Batman, Mr. President? I'll see if it can be arranged at once, Mr. President. What an afternoon. It's like a Londinium fog. Uh, speaking of Londinium that was himself, the president, speaking of Londinium? There have been unexplained robberies in Londinium from which all the thieves have escaped in what appears to be a man-made fog. I tried to persuade him that I could handle the problem. Just as I've tried to persuade you, Barbara, to take your vacation in Londinium with me. Two weeks fog-bound? No, thank you, Daddy. Oh, well, maybe Batman will be a little easier to convince. Batman? The president, at the request of the first minister and Londinium's venerable Ireland Yard wants the Caped Crusader to look into the strange situation. I think two weeks in Londinium would be delightful, Daddy. Excellent, Master Robin. Your turn at the Boy Scouts Vaudeville Show should prove what I believe is called a doozer. Cool it, Ringo. Yes, commissioner. The president. The first minister. Venerable Ireland Yard. Londinium. NARRATOR". And presently, on a crystal-clear Gotham City night a luxury liner is about to sail. Hello, Barbara, commissioner. Well, Bruce, what a pleasant surprise to find you and young Dick among our fellow passengers. I've been called on Wayne Foundation business and I thought that Dick here might find the trip broadening. - Excuse me, sir. Your crate is safely aboard. -Thank you, Alfred. I saw that immense thing with your name stenciled on it on the pier. What do you have in it? I don't think that Dick should neglect his studies so we brought along a thousand key works of literature, his biological specimens and also his own desk. - Yes, I expect to study hard. -it's a good thing you're going by ship, Dick. Here you are, commissioner. I just came down to wish you bon voyage, begorra. That's very generous of you, Chief O'Hara. Thank you very much. Any sign of the Dynamic Duo? I'm sure they're on board, Chief O'Hara. But knowing their dispositions, I doubt we'll see much of them. All ashore that's going ashore. Well, good luck, commissioner. - Goodbye, everybody. -Goodbye, chief. All ashore that's I think a ship sailing is one of the most exciting things in the world, don't you, Bruce? Glamorous, romantic, a sense of mystery and adventure. Hard to beat in this humdrum world. NARRATOR". While across the sea in the treasure-filled gallery of Easterland House What are our Londinium culprits up to now? Not Lady Easterland's precious horde of jeweled Russian Easter eggs. Then once more covering their tracks with Lord Ffogg's personal pea soup. And the following morning at Ffogg Place Marmaduke, the authorities have called on Batman. The Caped Crusader from the colonies? Why? In a last attempt to find out who's been carrying out our little pranks. You don't seem any too alarmed. Why should I be? We have an advantage over Batman that none of his other adversaries ever had. My invincible weapon. The pipe of fog. With it, we can make our entrances and exits in fogbound secrecy. Our sorties of the past will be as nothing compared to what the future holds. Nothing? You call the count's coin collection, the duchess's diamonds and Her Majesty's snuffboxes nothing? Nothing, compared to the Crown Jewels in the Tower of Londinium with which we may conclude our lives of crime. The Crown Jewels? Oh, Marmaduke, how utterly divine. Oh, yes, rather. Yes, rather, I say yes. NARRATOR". Presently, in the dungeon of a country manor house rented by Bruce Wayne near Londinium the Dynamic Duo are ready for action. Well, it isn't exactly the Batcave, sir. In fact, I strongly suspect that at one time, it was a dungeon. But, uh, it does have an isolated entrance connecting direct with the Queen's Highway. It will do the job, Alfred. And you did a great job unpacking Dick Grayson's books biological specimens and desk. And not even a scratch on the Batmobile. And the Batcomputer seems right at home too. Let's go, old chum. Commissioner Gordon will be waiting for us at venerable Ireland Yard. And if I may, sir, remember to drive on the left, not the right. NARRATOR". In no time at all, they are entering Londinium which is suffering from a spell of unusually clear weather. And turning off the Queen's Highway into Barnaby Street Blimey. The Batmobile. NARRATOR". Then a moment later in the office of Superintendent Watson in venerable Ireland Yard Superintendent Watson, I'd like you to meet the Caped Crusader, Batman. - How do you do? -And the Boy Wonder, Robin. - How do you do? It's a pleasure to meet you. -it's our pleasure, sir. You, of course, know my daughter Barbara. Yes, we do. These surroundings have a familiar feel. Yes, Batman, decor in a police department varies little the world over. When did you arrive in Londinium, Batman? We didn't see you on our liner. It's a large ship, Ms. Gordon. Well, superintendent, I suppose this small talk is slightly out of order in the face of your current criminal crisis. -It is indeed, Batman. Just one mysterious theft after another. We had hoped that they would end with Her Majesty's snuffboxes but earlier this week, these same pilferers invaded the gallery of Easterland House. And swept off with a precious horde of Russian jeweled Easter eggs. I read that in the ship's bulletin. Ah, swept out is right, Batman. And under cover of what seemed to be a man-made fog. - Holy haziness. -You say there are signs of this strange fog at the scene of every robbery. It's almost a trademark. Fog. Fogbound. Foghorn. - Aftergrass. - Aftergrass? Yes, aftergrass is a form of lawn, sometimes called fog. Beautiful too. Ffogg Place in Ffoggshire has one of the finest aftergrass lawns in the country. Ffogg Place. The famous baronial estate of Lord Marmaduke Ffogg? - Oh, you've heard of it? - Oh, yes. His fog lawn is world-renowned. Superintendent, what would be the chances of our looking around Ffogg Place? You, Batman? Heh. Surely you don't suspect Lord Ffogg, one of our most respected aristocrats. No, my friend, millionaire Bruce Wayne has a magnificent aftergrass lawn at stately Wayne Manor, outside of Gotham City. I'd like to compare it with Lord Ffogg's while I assemble my thoughts about our ubiquitous iniquitous enigma. Ooh! Good. Good. Lord Ffogg and his sister, Lady Penelope Peasoup also run a posh girl's finishing school there. They're quite proud of it. And I always like to get outside Londinium, you know, into the countryside gives me a chance to change hats, you know. Ha, ha. I'll call Lady Peasoup right now. Batman and Robin coming here? Why? Superintendent Watson said something about our aftergrass lawn. Yes, Prudence? Lady Prudence, Aunt Penelope. I came to tell you the girls and I are back from our little shopping expedition, governor. Mission accomplished. Good, Lady Prudence. Please have the girls freshen up. Ffogg Place is about to play host to Batman and Robin. The Dynamic Duo? Smashing. I doubt that Batman is coming in to look at any lawn, Penelope. But one false move and he'll be 6 feet under it. - Call Basil. -Right here, your lordship. And I couldn't help overhearing, sir. I'll have the chauffeur and footman start preparing a grave at once. Not right now, Basil. But when you do, make that two graves. We may need a second one for Robin, the Boy Wonder. NARRATOR". Thus again, very shortly, Ffogg Place prepares to receive its visitors. Hello there. Oh, Batman and Robin, how nice of you to come. And Superintendent Watson, and, uh Lady Peasoup, may I present Ms. Gordon. Her father is police commissioner of Gotham City. While he's attending a meeting in Londinium I thought I'd bring his charming daughter along with us. Welcome to Ffogg Place, my dear. Thank you. Oh. The gout again, Lord Ffogg? Not again. Always. - Oh. -Lady Prudence. His Lordship's daughter, my niece. She helps with the school. How do you do? - Duchess. - How do you do? - Kit. - How do you do? - Daisy. - How do you do? - Rosamond. - How do you do? They're our boarders. Our daily students are away on holiday. Lady Prudence, will you please stay here and entertain our guests? And, young ladies, may I suggest that you get back to your, uh, studies. A refreshing innovation, no school uniforms. Well, our little student bodies have their clothes specially designed on Barnaby Street. We like them to have individuality and to keep their wits about them. Their wits? Oh, they must learn to handle themselves in this world. So full of sham and deception. Did you finish, my dear? Finish? Oh, I graduated from college, if that's what you mean. Heh. A college graduate from across the sea. But it might be most interesting to add you to our faculty. What's this about aftergrass, Batman? I'm quite interested in fog lawns, Lord Ffogg. There it is. Help yourself. As nice a lawn as millionaire Bruce Wayne's, Batman? A fine stand of fog grass, Ms. Gordon. He was on our ship, you know. I wonder where he's staying in Londinium. I can't help you there, Ms. Gordon. A handsome fog lawn, Lord Ffogg. My, what an interesting pi-- One of my most beloved possessions, Batman. I promised them a look around the school, Lady Peasoup. Heh. What fun. Uh, Lady Prudence, perhaps you would show Robin around the grounds while I take care of the others. Smashing. Could I be excused from the tour, Lady Peasoup, and use your phone? I just remembered, an old friend of mine from Gotham City may be living close by. Of course, my dear. Now, Basil, will you please show Ms. Gordon the telephone in the hall? Of course, Your Ladyship. And we can start with the judo room in the girl's gymnasium. A judo room? An unlikely sport for young gentlewomen. Quick, Scudder, it's bug time. Advise the others. Operator, I'd like-- I'd like the number of Londinium's Temporary Visitors' Registration Office, please. NARRATOR". Shortly, in the Londinium Batcave near the Queen's Highway But how in the world did you find me, miss? I'll explain later, Alfred. But right now Just a minute. I've slipped an anti-eavesdrop plug into the phone, Alfred. Now, you can do me a great favor if you'll NARRATOR". While in the dormitory of Lady Peasoup's pretty little student bodies Oh, isn't Batman the grooviest? You're right, Duchess. And that Robin. I'm out of my skin over him. I wish we'd stolen some sharp threads today on Barnaby Street. Instead of that old silver tea service His Lordship wanted. You two flunked your course in thread lifting, don't you remember? - Well, you'll have to take it over. -Oh, and that Lady Prudence. Her father's pet. Well, let's just hope she isn't talking too much. I guess I've been talking too much. But this place is greeby. Greeby? It's supposed to be a finishing school. We're being finished all right, with an MS degree. - MS? -Mistresses of Shoplifting. That's what Lady Peasoup meant about using our wits. Holy contributing to the delinquency of minors. But you won't tell Batman, will you? I'd be roped outwith the governor. Roped out with the governor? In big trouble with my father. NARRATOR". While on another section of the grounds What's that, Lady Peasoup? Oh. A beehive. Special pets of Lord Ffogg's. African death bees. One sting and you're finished. Ha, ha. But he has so few other interests. But where is Ms. Gordon? I haven't the foggiest notion. Strange you should put it just that way, Lord Ffogg. She has left. Basil was telling me that the friend that she called is picking her up outside. She said she'd phone her father and explain. And she does hope you understand, superintendent. Hmm. It seems very odd. She also says that she'll call me later. She might be interested in joining our faculty, Marmaduke. Uh, for a short while, anyway. Perhaps we ought to be leaving, Batman. A pity. Maybe you could head back for your office. We'll join you as soon as Robin-- - I'm right here, Batman. - Good. Good day, Lord Ffogg. We found your fog lawn most impressive. Thank you, Batman. I'm sorry you found me indisposed. - Lady Peasoup. - I'll see you out. Our servants are at tea. Ha, ha. Well, Prudence, how did you make out with Robin? He's greeby, governor. Perhaps we've seen the last of those two Dynamic Dunderheads if the household staff aren't still at tea. NARRATOR". And on a country road near Ffogg Place I can't tell you how much I appreciate this, Alfred. No trouble, miss. Your directions were perfect. I found the key to the flat you rented borrowed this cab from my second cousin, Cuthbert, and, hey, presto Batgirl's clothes. -Oh, thank you, Alfred. Something's very wrong in Ffogg Place. I'm afraid Batman and Robin are headed for a lot of trouble. Of course, as usual our secret must not be disclosed. Mum's the word, miss. Would you like me to wait for you? Oh, no, I'll be all right. NARRATOR". So while Barbara Gordon begins her tantalizing transformation into Batgirl the visitors leave Ffogg Place and start back to Londinium. Through the fog-free countryside. But what's this? Holy roadblocks. And some rather unholy highwaymen, I'm afraid, Robin. Shouldn't be too hard to take that Batman. He looks like a slow bowler to me. And that youngster we'll make mincemeat out of him. Why wait? Come on, governor. Get out of that car. Come on, mate. Shake a leg. - Batgirl. -Batgirl? Holy show-ups, that Batgirl. She does make a colorful reinforcement, all right. I don't want her to think we can't fight our battles. Gosh, no, Batman. What do you suppose she's doing in Londinium? Where do you suppose she went? I can't answer the first. I've never been able to answer the second. - And where do you suppose she went in? -Or on. Those thugs looked like the footman, the butler, the chauffeur. I did notice a similarity. Let's go back to Ffogg Place and clean it up once and for all. Unless Lady Prudence was conning me, plenty to clean up. I'm sure there is, but it's hostile territory. I suggest we return to our Londinium Batcave and regroup our forces. Right as rain, Batman. Why on Earth did you invite that girl to join our faculty, Penelope? She's the daughter of Gotham City's police commissioner. Who no doubt has a direct line to Batman himself. - Wherever he may be. -Oh, but that's exactly why I did it, Marmaduke. To keep an eye on the doings of the Batman brigade through her. And if necessary, we would have a hostage. You're a dizzily clever woman. Holy surprise parties. NARRATOR". Has Basil, Lord Ffogg's friendly butler succeeded in befogging the Dynamic Duo? ls Batman up against a sticky wicket? Our next episode will give you much more than a foggy notion. 
NARRATOR". We have already seen stately Wayne Manor looted by the Archer and his merry marksmen. He robbeth from the rich and giveth to the poor. Batman and Robin called in to investigate Bruce and Dick's loss. Allan A. Dale questions their efficiency and how right he is. The villains take off. And the dynamic duo make a new friend. And meet a pretty Wench. But whose side is she on? The rich get poorer and the poor get richer. Batman and Robin on the job. But Archer is released on bail. And where has he gone? That is the question which Alfred may help answer. But it's all for naught. Alfred subjected to the unkindest cut of all. It's legerdemain and Batman knew it all the time. Batman and Robin staked out. The Archer plans to run them through with lances. Those of faint heart, look away. The most petrifying proceedings have not yet come to pass. There's no way out, Batman! It's always darkest before the dawn, Robin. And since we're at the very bottom, there's no place to go but up. The Bat Springs, now! We've got your number, Archer. Impossible, my dear sheriff of Gothamham My number's unlisted. Marilyn, push the cheer button. It's broken. Thou hast destroyed my audience. Thou hast smashed my ego-making machine asunder and rendered me helpless. Come on! - Let's go after them, Batman. -No. By the time we reach the Batmobile they will have disappeared. -But-- It's all right. We'll nab them, Robin. Now, let's free Alfred. Mm. I like that cape, Batman. Very chic. Wash and wear? We're not here to discuss my wardrobe, Mr. Dale. As administrative head of the Wayne Foundation one could presume that you've been in charge of the money from the beginning. We checked with Bruce Wayne and he doesn't know a thing about it. He doesn't know that I am in charge of the foundation's money? Of course he does. He is a rather dull chap but he is not that stupid. Well, what about it? The 10 million dollars. Did Mr. Wayne send you here to ask me that question? Every large foundation has its secrets. And employees trusted to keep those secrets. Understandably, Mr. Wayne is concerned about the handling of such a large sum and the problem of its reaching each of the 100,000 Gotham Cityites to which it's assigned. I'll be no problem. Confidentially, it's coming in directly from the government printing plant at the mint. And a very reputable firm is delivering it to me personally. - When? -Where? Oh, come, Batman, surely you can't expect me to reveal what is obviously such secret information. And certainly not without a letter of approval from Mr. Wayne or another of the trustees. - Is the money in cash? -Yes, Boy Wonder. Ten million dollars in crisp new 100-dollar bills. Do you realize, sir, what might happen if any criminal got wind of this? You misjudge the foundation's security measures, Batman. Now, if there's nothing else. No, that's all, Mr. Dale. Good day. Well As I said, he came to the Wayne Foundation highly recommended. Fair is fair, Robin. No man's honesty should be suspect without good and clear cause. Of course, Batman. I really gotta hand it to you, Archer. Hiding us out here in the basement at police headquarters really was a great idea. Oh, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn. Wouldst that thou couldst learn to speak proper English. We couldst make such beautiful speeches together. Oh, come off it, Archer. Everybody knows we come from the same neighborhood. Be thou silent, Wench. Loose lips sink ships. Ships. Wait a minute. Ships, Ships. Not a bad idea. I placed our horses in the stables with the sheriff's horses so we garner the benefit of free lodging for our steeds to boot. Good, good. Thou correctly determined the last place the police would look for us was under their red-veined noses. And thou was right. I are seldom wrong. Cut! Get out of here. Who goest there? Speakest now or forevermore hold thy tongue. Hi ho, everybody. Salutations, Allan A. Dale. What sayest thou? Just this: Batman and the Boy Wonder may have a bit of a sticky wicket planned for you. Sticky wicket? Thou speaketh in a unique vernacular. I speaketh, as we say on Madison Avenue about our gentlemen's agreement, Archer. I was to alert you to the location of the money when you were cut me in. Try that on for size. It fitteth. - Pray continue. - Hmm. Well my latest survey tells me that the armored can - I don't like it. -There's nobody on the street. Who could be firing at us? - That's brilliant, sire, brilliant. - Excellent, my liege. Just a little device I built in my spare time at the prison machine shop. So all right, already. You're gonna break your arm patting yourself on the back. I'll deal with you anon. All right. Calculate the trajectory, mon fusiliers. - Yes, my liege. -Draw! One, two, three! - Somebody's stealing the money. -I know, I know. For Pete's sake, whoever it was didn't take any of the money. It looks like they jumbled it around, but they didn't even steal a bag. NARRATOR". Eight hours have passed since that strange turn of events. And meanwhile, at stately Wayne Manor - Hello. -Bruce, this is Police Commissioner Gordon. - Yes, commissioner. Nice to talk to you again. -This is just a reminder call. You are going to attend the official ceremonies at city hall today? Yes, today is the day that the Wayne Foundation is giving its gifts to Gotham City's needy. -It should be very exciting. Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, will also be in attendance to make certain no incidents occur. I am sure you'll wanna meet them. Yes, they've been great favorites of mine for years. - I'll see you later, commissioner. - Right. Aunt Harriet, something's come up that requires my attention. - Dick's too. -It has? - Oh. - Immediately. Excuse us, Aunt Harriet. - Alfred. -What's up, Bruce? - We've got trouble. -Trouble? Real trouble, right here in Gotham City. But I've got an idea. Alfred, meet us in the Batcave. To the Batpoles. - Aren't you getting dressed for work? -No. Not this time, Robin. I have to attend an official function as Bruce Wayne and Batman is supposed to be there too. How can I be of service, sir? We're trying to figure out how Batman and Bruce Wayne can be in the same place at the same time. - A knotty problem, sir, if I may say so. -No, there's a solution, Alfred. - You'll have to change your clothes. -My--? - My clothes, sir? -Mm-hmm. Oh, they, uh-- They want a picture now. I understand you almost lost the money, Mr. Dale. Yes, but as you can see, their efforts were unsuccessful. But who knows what might have happened if we'd had to depend on those two up there. I pray our deception succeeds, Master Robin. Just puff up your chest and look virile, Alfred. - Good to see you. -Thank you. Oh, glad you could come, Bruce. - Certainly a fine day for the ceremony. -Yes, I wouldn't have missed it for anything. Who is that doing the honor? Mr. Marshall Roland, Gotham City commissioner in charge of poor people. An old fraternity brother of mine of G. C. U. Look, they're about to start. My fellow citizens of Gotham City it is not often a person gets to preside at such an auspicious occasion. Due to the gracious generosity of the Wayne Foundation we are here today to carry on the work of that fine organization. Hear, hear. I do so wish he'd get on with it. Sounds as if he's electioneering for governor. - He's already been governor. -Old habits are hard to break. And now, we will present the money in reverse alphabetical order. Will Mr. Zoltan Zorba please step forward? That's great, go ahead. Go on, get up there. Looks like it's going smoothly, Alfred. Hey. What are you trying to pull here? This bill is counterfeit! They're trying to hoodwink us! What kind of phony deal you trying to pull? Friends, this is a fraud! They're trying to take us in! It's counterfeit money! They say there's something rotten in Denmark. Something's rotten in Gotham, and it's right here, in phony money! So the Archer struck even before the fact. - I better call Batman down. -An excellent idea, commissioner. But I've got to call the office and see if the insurance covers this loss. I quite understand, Mr. Wayne. Chief, let me have that. Batman! Boy Wonder! Please come down! We need you! We'll be right there, commissioner! - I'm afraid we're in for it now, Master Robin. -Bruce will be with us in a minute, Alfred. Just as soon as he finds a place he can change into his Batman outfit. Let's go. I thought you'd be changing by now, Bruce. There's no time for that now, Robin. We'll have to do it another way. Just speak into this, Alfred. I've already pre-set the Bat Speech imitator so that my own voice will come out. - Splendid. It will help hide my mustache. -Good thinking, Alfred. You're on your own now, old chum. I can't understand what's taking Batman so long. Usually he'd simply swing down via his Batrope. He should be here any moment. Here they are now. Yes, commissioner. What's wrong? That infernal Archer has outwitted us. The money is counterfeit. Holy deviltry! Say, Batman, are you all right? I have a bit of a cold, Commissioner Gordon. I thought it might be infectious. - I don't want anyone to catch it. -Ha-ha-ha! Just like Batman. Always thinking of his fellow man. - What do you think happened? -The money was switched during the night. Ten million dollars. This is the crime of the century. Don't worry, sir. Batman always gets his man. Say, Boy Wonder, uh Batman looks a little, uh, thinner these days. Is he all right? Uh, except for the cold, he's fine. Well, tell him to get some relaxation and make sure to eat all his vegetables. I'll tell him, sir. How did I do, Master Robin? You could have fooled me. Let's go, Alfred. - Bruce will meet us back at the Batcave. -Right you are, sir. That swaggering churl and his guttersnipes made good their threat. - This will probably mean my job. -I'm sure Batman and Robin will get them. Oh, I fear those piratical desperadoes have already unbuckled their swashes and fled Gotham City. - Arrivederci, Mr. Wayne. -You're, uh You're leaving? I hie me now to Fire Cove for a bit of the bounding main. Allow me to offer you my hearty handclasp. Keep in touch, won't you? You can be sure you'll hear from me. Phew! Gosh, Batman. We're really up a tree this time. Even the Bat Crimeputer struck out. There's a large mural here. And one small piece of canvas must be brushed in before we can get the entire picture. Let's fill it in. The armored car was attacked at dawn and the only ones who knew about the money delivery were you, I and - Allan A. Dale. -Correct. And the money was brand new and in serial-number sequence. Archer wouldn't dare try to spend the money because all the banks in the country will be on the lookout for it. But where did he-- I fancy the word is stash. --All that money until the heat was removed? There's only one place in the world where the heat would be off: Switzerland. Of course. I read about it in my economics class. And they give you an account number so you can remain anonymous. That's correct, Robin. It's as plain as the masks on our faces. The Archer said we could never obtain his number because it was - Unlisted. -Correct. And Allan A. Dale went boating at Fire Cove. - Do you know where Fire Cove is? -Well, I've spent many a summer there, sir. It's the last spot of land one sees before going out to open water. - That leads to Europe. -Precisely. And Commissioner Gordon said he had the roads and the airplanes covered. But the Archer has signaled two if by sea. To the Batboat via Batmobile. Officer! Officer! I don't understand this. How come Batman gets away with driving so fast cutting around corners, going through lights? Why, if I did that I'd be in jail the rest of my life. Batman is a duly deputized officer of the law, ma'am. And if he is not pursuing a dangerous criminal he drives more safely than any motorist I've ever seen. In his off-hours, he lectures on traffic safety to driving classes all over Gotham City. No, ma'am. If ever you see Batman driving speedily you can be sure that he is endangering his life to protect yours and mine. Stand by to raise the foc's'le and mains'le and the tops'le! And do it on the double-quick or I'll keelhaul you! I just love that kind of talk. I think I'll go downstairs to the kitchen. Thou meanest the galley. Oh, whatever you say, Archer baby. Now, heed this: Scrape the barnacles pump the bilge, me scurvy crew, then hard alee to Marseille. - Mr. Archer? -Thou speakest? I'm getting seasick already. And we've not yet left port. You'll all be more than seasick by the time we get through with you. Avast, me hearties. Draw thy bows. Quick, Robin, the Batshield. Fire one, fire two! Abandon boat. Take to the sword. Don't let them get away, fellows. Slice them into small pieces. By thunder, thee will walk the plank yet. Holy Blackbeard! Carve them up, swabbies, or thee will all hang from the yardarm. Hey, you guys. I doff my cowl to you, Maid Marilyn. Fair is fair. Et tu, Brute. Ugh! Not bad, Dick. Let me give it try. Well done, sir. And you too, Master Dick. But if I may, I'd like to show you how we use to do it in merry old England. We could use a few pointers, Alfred. And now, Master Dick, if you'll do the honors I'll show you that my nickname of William Tell was no jest. Uh, I'd rather not, Alfred. - Not that I don't trust you or anything. -Oh. Dick is right, Alfred. We shouldn't take any unnecessary chances. - Oh, very well, sir. -Here, I'll put it on the target for you. Oh, thank you, Master Dick. Yes. You must be very careful. Draw the bow back very, very slowly until you reach the desired degree of tension on your bowstring. Hmm'? - And then sight the target - Okay. in this is manner and release very smoothly like this. - Right between the eyes! -You were saying? Heh. I do believe I forgot to dust the Batcave, sir. Yes. Heh. If you'll excuse me. 
Batman Officer. Officer. Help. Officer! Some kook melted the ice rink. With a flame thrower, yet! Ice? In July? But who would melt down an ice rink and then turn right around ice up a street and. . You don't mean. . That diabolical snow man. Who can only exists in temperatures Oh, no! Man with a heart of ice and a cold calculating brain of the master criminal. There only one man in this entire city capable of defrosting Mr. Freeze. Agreed? I'll call him, sir. Wow! All you do is rough up the cover get a good grip on the seams, get that pitching arm-- Careful, the vase. - Ah. - Pow! - What part I hit? - You're out. That's the way you do it. The old Diamante fast ball special. Shades of Sandy Koufax! No wonder they call you the Great Diamante. You must be about the best pitcher in the world. About? Yes. Just ask him. I'd like to say it's not only been a pleasure but an education to have the three most illustrious members of the Gotham City Eagles here for lunch. - Do I hear a second? - Second the motion. - Third. - Here, here. - I hope you liked my cherry. . - The Bat-phone, sir. Thank you, Alfred. I didn't realize it was that late. Seems I have an impatient date waiting, gentlemen. Well, what're you waiting for? Hard to keep the young lady waiting? Or the ladies younger sister. But is any young teenage miss worth pitching lesson from the Great Diamante? We were leaving anyway. Thanks it was a wonderful dinner. - The meal was terrific. - Thank you, boys. Thank you so much. Come again, won't you? Yes, commissioner. Chilling news. It's Mr. Freeze. We're on our way. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na Batman Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Roger, ready to move out. Poor devil. Forced to live in an air condition suit that keeps his body temperature down to 50 degrees below zero. No wonder his mind is warped. Your pity is all well, Batman. But what's he up too? Yes. What is the point of his shenanigans? I see calling cards, Chief O'Hara. To let me know he's back in Gotham City. Of course, he wants revenge. - I'm not so sure I blame him. - It was an accident, Batman. You didn't mean to knock that beaker of instant freeze on him during a fight in his laboratory. The Boy Wonder is right. He was the culprit, Batman. Experimenting with those devilish instant freeze solutions and for some criminal purpose, undoubtedly. True, commissioner. Nevertheless I feel it's my duty not only to catch him but with all the medical know how at our command to help that sorry creature back to a normal way of life. Noble sentiments, Batman. Wasted on the fiendish likes of him. Perhaps, men. We'll soon see. But with his revenge, he just may want a dividend. - A dividend? - Money. Maintaining his sub zero environment is expensive. Holy iceberg! We can expect a crime wave. No, Robin. A cold wave. - Of terror. - How? Where will he strike first? That's for him to plot and us to guess. We'll use our anti-crime computer in the Bat-cave. Right, Robin. If there're any new strange occurrences, commissioner call us immediately on the hotline. To the Batmobile. Let's go. And even as the dynamic duos speeds back to the Bat-cave a strange scene ensues inside Mr. Freeze's super air conditioned mountain hideout. Revenge! Revenge! I will pin Batman's hide to the walls of City Hall after I have made him the laughing stock of Gotham City. Oh! Well, Kolevator, what're you waiting for Christmas? You forgot to turn on my hot path, sir. I forgot that you have not the same reverse metabolism as I have. There nice warm from kitchen to table. Thank you, sir. Nippy, have you ordered the airplane to go zoom, zoom, zoom? Yeah, boss. Und Chill, how many Batman's have you hired for this afternoon? - Five, boss. - Und Mo, how many of me? And five of youse naturally. Five Batman's, five of me. This is the beginning of the end of Batman's. Nippy, give my order to unleash the decoys. Right, boss. I will toy with him like cat with mouse. I will lure him right to the scene of the crime. First I toy, then I destroy. In the Bat-cave far below Stately Wayne Manor Batman and the Boy Wonder make plans for their meeting with their frosty foe. 'Ten, nine, eight, seven, six' 'five, four, three, two, one, zero. ' Zero is maximum. Failed again. The anti-freeze capsule, won't do the job. Iced tea, sir. Holy blizzard! Who needs iced tea at a time like this, Alfred? Hot tea might be more appropriate, Alfred. Under the circumstances. I anticipated the circumstances, sir. Piping hot. - Anticipated? - Yes, sir. From the newspaper. A rather strange little column concerning melted ice rinks and bursting ice dispensers. Might lead one to suppose that Mr. Freeze was back in town again. - He's back, alright. - Unfortunately. - Seeking revenge. - Oh, dear, dear me. How very distressing. And thisthis freezing chamber contraption if I might be so bold as to enquire, sir. Would that be some sort of defense against, Mr. Freeze? Not that. This. This new anti-freeze capsule. Taken internally and enables the person to withstand intense cold. But we're using the freezing chamber to test the results. If I understand you correctly, sir. - It tested down to. . - Zero. Not cold enough, sir? To be affective against Mr. Freeze we must withstand 50 degrees below zero temperatures. If we're forced to meet him on his own ground. I'm sure we're in for a mighty chilly reception. Do you think it might come to that, sir? Who knows. All we can assume is that somewhere, somehow his evil scheme for revenge is in operation. . right now. But how can Batman be in six places at once? Impossible. oh, Look at these patrol car reports. He's been spotted uptown, downtown, east side, west side. And every officer wants to know, what's the trouble? What's Batman doing in my territory? Impossible. They're imposters of course. We must notify Batman. Yes, commissioner. You asked me to report any strange occurrences. I think this one qualifies. Now, that's the last location where a patrol car spotted me? 'You were seen there less than two minutes ago. ' Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold. . "Batman last reported at 59th street, now at 57th. " - That about wraps it up. - I'll be in touch. Move me in from 59th street to 57th. Holy schizophrenia! If you're all these places at the same time. . You sure are spreading yourself pretty thin. Notice the pattern. They all seem to be moving in to the center. Leapin' Lumbago! - The diamond exchange. - The diamond. . But of course. Diamonds. In the vernacular of the underworld ice! Let's go! Very nice. Thank you. Now, the famous Star Of Kashmir diamond, if you please. Oh, dear me no. Not the Star Of Kashmir. - The star. Immediately. - Well, I-I. . It's in the safe. There. But I don't know the combination. Cross my heart and hope to die. Who needs combination? Drop 'em. Who needs chicken feed. Ah! Look at that. The most valuable diamond in the world. The second. Nein! Nein! No guns. How many times must I tell you, no ordinary guns. I want they should be frozen stiff. Mr. Perkins. Mr. Perkins. - Look. It's Batman. - Oh, dear. Like one big happy family, eh? Hey, the real Batman. Follow me. It's the real me, chum. Nein. Nein. Batman, look. Mr. Freeze. Holy snowball! The turbines they're iced. We're frozen out. Batman. Look. Pow, if only I could've landed one punch on the real Mr. Freeze. Think positive, Robin. Our computer should clue us in on where he's liable to strike next. Jewelry shops? Why didn't I think of that? One thing we know for sure. Mr. Freeze is out to steal all the ice in Gotham City. On the contrary, one thing we know for sure is that he's not out to steal all the ice in Gotham City. Otherwise why would he leave a fortune in lose diamonds on the floor of the diamond exchange. Yeah! Yeah! Assuming he doesn't want all the ice. Perhaps he does want the best. These cards indicate the most expensive diamonds in the world and where they're located. Circle the locations on the map. "Marie Antoinette Tiara Trieste Jeweler "52nd and Avenue, Peace. '"Devil's Teardrop, Maurice Leroux Export. ' "Ghiaccio Circulo. " The most valuable diamond in the world. But that's not in Gotham City. It's owned by Princess Sandra of the principality of Molino. That's it. "The Ghiaccio Circulo. " English translation, "Ice circle. " - I'm studying Italian. - Excellent. - Circle for zero. - Zero temperature. Owned by the Princess Sandra. - Who's flying to Gotham City. - For the charity baseball game. - Tomorrow afternoon. - Tonight. But the game's tomorrow. But she's arriving tonight. Meanwhile in the royal suite of the Gotham City Hotel. Princess Sandra, formerly Sandra Carlson from Brooklyn tends her social affairs. Unaware of an impending surprise. Call the ambassador and tell him that I'll be over to receive him on Thursday at 2 p. m. and make sure you talk to his wife. Freshly cut flowers for the dining room. Thank you, Gabriel. And I'm expecting 30 people. What is it? 'For your Royal Highness, from Molino by air. ' Oh, how delightful. I wonder what cut of beef this is? - It's cold cuts. - The alarm. Yes, commissioner. The royal suitewe're getting a continuous signal from that special alarm system that you told us to install. Good. It's working, Batman. Gotham City Hotel. Stop. Nobody move or they get frozen stiff too. Well, now, Ghiaccio Circulo, if you please. The diamond, now. Wait. Let's take a short cut. Right. They could have look outs in the lobby. No. No. Nobody says no to me, never. Wunderbar. Wunderbar. Tell Batman when he arrives, if he arrives, what happened. Tell him yourself, Dr. Schimmell. Alias, Mr. Freeze. No, Robin, the safety of the hotel guest first. Fire under control. After them, Robin. Sorry about this, Your Highness. Nein. Nein. Nein. Stop. I don't want to kill you. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. I'm sorry, Batman. I wanted to toy with you a little longer. But that is the way the ice cube crumbles. Has Batman struck out? Is Robin cool, for good? Can no one save our noble pair of human popsicles? Answers tomorrow night! Same time, same channel. One word of warning. By watching you too, can lose your cool! Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". Another brisk bright day blossoms in Gotham City. But is day the only thing that's blooming, or isn't blooming? The park is ready, commissioner. The police are ready. All the flower children in Gotham City are ready for their fancy flower-in. But there are no flowers. No flowers in Gotham City, Chief O'Hara? Somehow someone has cornered the flower market. Mainly the lilacs. Oh, sure, there's gonna be trouble at that flower-in with no flowers, begorra. Plenty of trouble. And all because I, Louie, the Lilac the great Louie, the Lilac have cornered the flower market. But what do you expect to gain by that, Louie? Some young people of the flower generation will be the future leaders of the country, Arbutus. And when I have them within my flower-power, and control their minds Gotham City will be my garden to loot and plunder. And later, the world. To the Flowermobile. Let's start with Princess Primrose. They all tune in on her. NARRATOR". While at the flowerless flower-in Some flower-in, Princess Primrose, without any flowers. I mean, it's freaky, man. Like, how can we take a flower love trip? Think flowers, Dogwood. You know, just think flowers. Barbara. Barbara Gordon. Hello, Thelma. It's not Thelma any longer, Barbara. I'm Princess Primrose. I'm a flower child now, and these are my flower friends. We're having a flower-in, you know. It's cool, man, and you'll blow your mind. I think we'll call you Hyacinth. I think you've flipped a petal or two. It's Louie, the Lilac, in his Flower mobile. Oh, I knew Louie, the Lilac would come to our rescue. There you are. Flowers. Oh, I'm grooved, man. Lilacs for my flower children. There you are. Lilacs, lilacs. Flowers. Lilacs for my flower children. Flowers. Lilacs. There you are, all of you. Lilacs, lilacs. Ah, Princess Primrose. Come, let's go back to my greenhouse and plan our worldwide flower-in. Away, Acacia. Man, now, that really gets me uptight. I mean, Princess Primrose splitting with Louie, the Lilac? I mean, that's a bum trip. Like, these plastic flowers ain't where it's at, man. I'm tuned out, you know? But, Daddy, somehow he mesmerized her and then drove off with her. Barbara, the police have many serious things to worry about. Besides some Princess Primrose being whisked away from a public park in a Flowermobile. That's just it. She wasn't whisked away, she was kidnapped. I'm sure of it. And she's a friend of mine. I went to college with her when she was Thelma Jones. We're late for a meeting with the city council, Barbara. Relax. I can't relax. I'm late too. I should've been at the library an hour ago. Barbara, a good librarian is a calm librarian. Of course, Ms. Gordon. I'll call him. It's, uh, Commissioner Gordon's daughter, sir. Barbara Gordon on the red phone? This is Batman, Ms. Gordon. I probably shouldn't have used this phone, Batman. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Not at all. Robin and I were just putting a flower decal on the Batmobile. We're to be guests of honor at a flower-in this afternoon. That's what I wanted to talk to you about, the flower-in. NARRATOR". And in Louie, the Lilac's isolated greenhouse which, in turn, houses his humid hothouse I don't know what you did to me, Louie, or why I'm here but how can I run a flower-in from this greenhouse? Flower-ins aren't of prime importance to me, Primrose. It's the flower children, and you're their princess. Sometimes I think I'm too much of a ding-a-ling. - So does Barbara Gordon. -Barbara Gordon? The police commissioner's daughter who works at Gotham Library. She was walking through the park this morning when you arrived in your Flowermobile. Police Commissioner Gordon? All right, Primrose, into the hothouse. A good place to keep you out of sight until your friends get my message. Lock the door. When the stupefying aromatic spray from my pocket lilac wears off she may try to get out. Acacia, you keep your eye on her, you understand? And see that the hothouse lets off more steam than she does. Arbutus, tail Barbara Gordon. Who knows what she might have told her father? Get going. I'm going down to police headquarters. The Batmobile's usually parked in an alley nearby. This may be my big chance. I don't dig this fade-out of Princess Primrose. And I don't dig Louie, the Lilac, either. Or his plastic flowers. I mean, flower people try to do good, you know, and spread joy-pollen. But all Louie does is make a bad scene. So let's us make a little rumble down at fuzztown. Come on. My daughter Barbara had no right to call you with the red phone. It precipitated the first real argument we've ever had. 'Tis a sad thing to hear. She was understandably concerned about Princess Primrose. And this Louie, the Lilac, what do you know about him? Very little, Batman. We'll check with the Batcomputer about the present whereabouts of Louie, the Lilac. - Yes, Bonnie? - Commissioner there are a bunch of flower children out here to see you. Flower children? All right, send them-- Wait a minute, Bonnie. Hold on. We'll go out the window. Otherwise, we'll be mobbed. Mobbed? In police headquarters? The flower children think we're cool, man. We turn them on, you know. Yes, please, be gentle with your visitors, commissioner. Although it may not be understood by more literal minds in their own way, they're doing what they can to correct the world's woes with love and flowers. All right, Bonnie. I'll see them now. Brace yourself for some nutty nosegays, Chief O'Hara. What's that? It's a flowery little advertising card, Robin. "Lila's Lilac Shop. 11 Lavender Lane. " This bears investigation. I strongly suspect that this lilac-colored card could be a plant. Lila? Louie. - Lila? -Yes, Louie. You may be receiving a couple of unusual customers, Lila. Batman and Robin. Batman and Robin? If they've fallen for my little ruse. Do you still have some alba vulgaria in stock? Poison lilacs? There may be some tired ones around, Louie. Why? I'm sure that the dynamic duo will be overwhelmed by their fragrance anyway, Lila. And I'll be there shortly to help you dispose of the soon-to-be-creped crusaders. Amazing. Truly amazing. Look at all these lilacs, Robin. Good day, gentlemen. Obviously you haven't been affected by the current flower shortage in Gotham City. I guess I'm just lucky. Lucky, or being favored for some special reason? I'm afraid I don't understand you, Batman. But my display is nice, isn't it? And I have some other very rare lilacs in the rear room, if you'd like to see them. I'm always interested in the unusual of any specie. I'll bring them out. What do you think? A wild lilac chase'? I think she makes a delightful distraction for whatever Louie, the Lilac's ultimate scheme may be. Oh, dear. How clumsy of me. I'll get them. Robin, look out. Those could be poison alba vulgaria. While in Barbara Gordon's apartment I may be imagining things, Charlie, but I think some man followed me home from the library. He came up the service stairs when I took the elevator. If he found the fire escape landing, he might very well be out on my-- What are you doing on this terrace? Just admiring the view of Gotham City, lady, that's all. From my terrace? Faced the wrong way? The police will be interested in this. The police ain't gonna be interested in nothing at all, lady. NARRATOR". And while Barbara faces her vexatious visitor what's happening in the hothouse of Louie's greenhouse? Man-eating lilacs? Holy purple Cannibals. Exactly, Boy Blunder. A rare specie just in from Brazil which I crossed with even more carnivorous plants. And gusty gourmands they are. They got ahold of an explorer one day in the jungle and left nothing but his shoelaces. What happened to Princess Primrose? She's drying out in the office. Flower children wilt fast. She and her flower friends will do more than just wilt before I'm through with them. - Come on, let's get out of here. -Oh, yes, Louie. It's so humid in here. Gosh, Batman, what a way to go. Eaten alive by a lilac. Well, Robin, at least it's a flowery finish. NARRATOR". With the dynamic duo being devoured whole by a strange specie of man-eating lilac what are we doing here in the Batcave? Maybe this call on the red phone will tell us. I'm sorry, sir. He's out. - Out where? -I don't know, sir. When he and Master Robin left, they were on their way to your office. When they left, they were on their way back to the Batcave to consult the Batcomputer about a renowned criminal named Louie, the Lilac. Louie, the Lilac? If you hear from Batman, have him contact me. Of course, sir. Barbara's phone is dead, Batman is out. Nothing is going-- Now, commissioner, watch your blood pressure. To consult the Batcomputer about a renowned criminal called Louie, the Lilac. And he hasn't been heard from since. "Lila's Lilac Shop. 11 Lavender Lane. " At least they're gentle about it. I haven't felt one bite me yet. Man-eating lilacs have no teeth, Robin. It's a process of ingestion through their tendrils. Batman, we've gotta get out of this somehow. Can't you get to your utility belt and signal Alfred? No, they've already consumed my utility belt, Robin. And my hands are entwined by these vicious vines. Holy Luther Burbank. How are they doing, Louie? Ooh! I can't look. A lilac's digestive processes are much slower than a human. It takes a little time. You monster. Monster? What would your flower children think of such language from their princess? I'm sure that when you speak to them shortly, you'll talk of me in much more endearing terms. Let's really put my flower-power to work in the park. To the flower-in. Whilst in Barbara's apartment Lady, it don't take no 10 minutes to powder your nose in a locked bedroom. - Who are you? What do you want? -From one interloper to another perhaps you might answer those questions. -I ain't interloping. A lady friend of mine just locked herself in her bedroom. If she looked herself in the bedroom, there must have been a reason. Well, that's her reason and mine, not yours. - You, uh, got some connection with Batman? -Speaking of connections what happened to that phone? -She was gonna call the cops-- So you ripped out the phone and she locked herself in her bedroom? Why were you here? Now, wait a minute, wait. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm leaving. I'm leaving now. I'm getting out of here. The cops and her father, Commissioner Gordon. Strange, that looked like Batgirl out on the terrace. Batgirl? Batgirl? Oh, Barbara, I've been so worried about you. What was Batgirl doing here? Batgirl? I believe you saw the intruder who followed me home from the library. I tried to call you at the office, but he ripped out the phone. Put men around this building and have that phone repaired. When you wanted to be on your own when you insisted on taking an apartment, I was afraid something like this would happen. Oh, Daddy, nothing's happened. I locked myself in the bedroom and I'm perfectly all right. Really. - I think you should move back home. -Is that what you were trying to call me about? No, I-- I thought you might have dinner with me tonight. But when the line was dead Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry. And I'd love to have dinner with you tonight. First I have to go back to the library for a while this afternoon. I'd only come home for lunch and discovered the intruder. Well, he won't intrude on you again, I can tell you that for sure. I hope you're right, Chief O'Hara. Thank you for being worried about me. I'll call you when I get home from work. Good girl. Bye. There's a lot of traffic on that balcony today. I went through your service hall, and then came along the outside ledge. I couldn't risk being caught. After all, we're the only ones who know our little secret. The rumor's around that something's happened to Batman and Robin. Mr. Wayne looked into it a bit but I have reason to believe that they were last seen in a florist's on Lavender Lane. Though the Batmobile has been located outside an isolated greenhouse. I can't tell all you flower children what a fine and generous man Louie, the Lilac, is and how he's cornered the flower market to make this flower-in a success. And what hopes and dreams he has for us and the future of the world. And what hopes and dreams he has for us and the-- NARRATOR". What's this? Apparently Louie's stupefying aromatic spray has worn off. And You've tripped out, Primrose. Groovy, but in the wrong groove. You're right, man. He's tuned out. Grifty. And now he's putting a period on Batman and Robin in his poisonous purple pad. Batman and Robin? Wow, man, he ought to be called Louie, the Louse. Get us out of here, Acacia. Get us out quick! After him! - Let's go! - Let's get him! NARRATOR". And shortly, back with the semi-digested duo. One of these monsters is nibbling at my ear, Batman. I said, one of these monsters is nibbling at my ear. I heard you, Robin. I've managed to loosen one foot. There's a flower pot next to it. If I can just kick it through that glass. Well, we finally got rid of those flower creeps for now. But' I'll get my flower-power to work yet. I wonder how the Brazilian man-eaters are doing with the dynamic duo. Aah! They're not even chewed up a little. Nor will we be. A word of advice, Louie. One blast of cool air kills these blooming cannibals far quicker than they can devour any human repast. Gosh, yes. Get Azalea, Petunia. Not you again. - How did you get mixed up in this? -Maybe some other time and place we can have a question-and-answer session, Batman, but not here. Louie, she's got a spray can of powdery mildew. Don't use it. Don't use that spray. Anything it touches molds and decays. They're getting away, Batman. Don't worry, Robin. Go out to the Batmobile. Alert Commissioner Gordon, he'll round them up. He's mildewed. He's wilting. Maybe mildewed and wilting and molding and decaying on the outside, Lila. But inside I'm still Louie, the Lilac. And somehow, some day, I'm going to control the flower market of the world. And with it, the entire flower generation. Batman, there's about a thousand flower children outside. They found your Flowermobile, and they're after your budding scalp. Louie, it looks like it's lilac time for you. Never. Never! Never! Batman, he's thrown himself into the man-eating lilacs. Don't worry, Robin. That cold blast of air put those lilacs in a torpor. Go back outside and calm the flower children. - They'll mob me. -Groovy. And I think your car's arriving. Batgirl, would you take this young lady--? She's gone, Batman. She knew when to get out of here. Smart dame. Who is she? I don't know. I never have, perhaps I never will. But I Wish I did. I calmed down the flower children and they've gone, Batman. And the police have taken Lila away. I said we'd bring in Louie, the Lilac. Holy hoof beats. Exactly, Robin. And if I'm not mistaken, a band of Bessarovian Cossacks just rode by. Olga, wait for me. Olga. Oh, come on. Excuse me. Darling, hurry up. We don't have all day. - Oh, Olga. -Come on. Olga, wait for me. Wait. Egghead. What do you suppose he's doing back in Gotham City? And that woman. She looked like a real Tartan princess. I predict that Batman and Robin will soon be getting a call on the red telephone. But first let's rescue Louie, the Lilac, from those clinging vines. NARRATOR". Be sure to watch the next episode for what Egghead and a Tartar princess named Olga have in store for the Caped Crusaders. 
NARRATOR". Another groovy day in Gotham City and everything seems just right in our teeming metropolis. But there's a new face in the crowd. The face of Black Widow. Oh, good morning, madam. May I help you? Yes, you may, doll. I would like to open a tiny new savings account. - An excellent way to start the day. -Yes. Come with me, please. Thank you. Now then, your name and marital status. Uh, Mrs. Max Black. Widow. How large an initial deposit do you wish to make, Mrs. Widow? Mrs. Black. And now, Irv, darling will you bring me 20 or 30,000 from the vault? Ah. Sir, you're an absolute love. Ta-ta. - How did you do, Black Widow? -Fine, Tarantula. I have done it again. There now, Mr. Cash, this isn't the end of the world. There was this strange vibration and then I'm handing her thousands. I couldn't stop myself. It was as though the devil himself was at work on you. Or someone just as clever. Do you mean, you know who pulled this job? You may not remember but how could I ever forget. - Black Widow. -Black Widow. You must be joking. I wish I were, Chief O'Hara, but it all points to her. Opening a new account, the huge handbag the black outfit, the charm and fascination. Oh, that's her, commissioner. Quick, catch her. Not quite that simple, I'm afraid. But we, heh-heh, do have a chance. T-the dynamic duet? Duo. That's dynamic duo. The dynamic duo indeed. NARRATOR". At this moment, within the walls of stately Wayne Manor an unveiling is taking place. How do you like them, Dick? Fine, Aunt Harriet, but I already have a pair of black pants. Well, they're not for you, silly. They're for me. I've decided to go mod. Now what do you boys think? Tres chic, Aunt Harriet. Every bachelor in Gotham City will be staring. I wanted to get a miniskirt, but the sales girl wasn't sure I had the face for it. Oh, Alfred, how do you like my new outfit? (Barnaby Street has come to Wayne Manor, madam. - Sir. -Yes, Alfred. Mr. Gordon Commish is calling. Yes, we've been expecting his call. Uh, excuse us, Aunt Harriet, we may be tied up for a little while. Dick. There they go, healthy as normal and I'm such a beatnik. Yes, commissioner. Good to hear your voice, Batman. You'll never guess who's in town. - Mr. Freeze? -No. - Penguin, Joker? -Black Widow has crawled into Gotham City. We're on our way. It's Black Widow. - The Black Widow? -I'm afraid so. To the Batpoles. "Black Widow wins her victim's confidence by pretending to open a savings account. Her methods of overpowering include hypnosis, drugs and other artificial brain stimuli. " Excuse me ignorance, Batman but what does a lady's hairdryer have to do with all this? This, Chief O'Hara, in spite of its appearance is a brainwave Bat-Analyzer. It registers the brainwave patterns in the various control areas of the human brain. Most ingenious. Judging by her past modus operandi, Robin and I suspect that Black Widow may have short-circuited a portion of Mr. Cash's brain thereby rendering him incapable of making judgments. Oh, this is worse than I thought. First my money, now my brain. Easy, citizen. Whatever she did in there will wear off. Sit down, please. Now, will you insert your head in the Brainwave Bat-Analyzer. No cause for concern, Mr. Cash. You can be sure, if it's Batman. If you say so. Cortex. Thalamus. Cerebellum not impaired. Medulla, A-okay. Holy nerve center, what is it, Batman? The cerebrum, Robin. Black Widow put Mr. Cash's cerebrum out of commission. He was powerless to control his actions. You can come out now, Mr. Cash. You-- You can come out now, Mr. Cash. Incredible. That secret weapon of hers, she could clean out every bank in Gotham City and we'd always be one step behind her. Me men are clever, goodness knows but where the human brain is concerned, they're just not equipped. How do we stop her, Batman? That is our problem. We haven't a second to lose. - Quick, Robin, the Bat-Analyzer. -Got it. Batman, am I going to be all right? Take two cold tablets and get plenty of rest your cerebrum will be fine in the morning, Mr. Cash. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in the web an underground grotto somewhere in Gotham City Black Widow and her spidery companions are enjoying the fruits of Black Widow's labor of love. Ah-ah-ah! Don't touch, Tarantula. Well, I just wanted to run it through my fingers, B. W. You will have to wait. I still have a fabulous list of banks I must clean out before we split. Trap Door, what are you doing out of your trap door? - I got lonely. -Oh, poor soul. I don't know how you do it, Blacky. I tried robbing banks when I was younger but I always got nailed before I was out the door. Incentive, Daddy Long Legs. That's why you blew it. But didn't your husband Max always say that money can't buy happiness? Happiness can't buy money. Heh. Poor sweet Max. Why is it taking so long, Batman? Every known fact about Black Widow has been fed into the Batcomputer. There were over 3,000 separate cards to collate and analyze. Sorry, Batman, but knowing that that arch-villainess may be robbing a Gotham City Bank at this very minute bothers me. Bother you? It should. Just as it should bother any red-blooded American citizen who recognizes the law and obeys it. NARRATOR". At this very minute, at yet another Gotham City Bank And by the way, doll bring me 20 or 30 thou in small unmarked bills. Can you do that for me? Beneficial is here to benefit you, Mrs. Black. You're sure that will fill your needs? How sweet of you to ask. Make it 40. "Black Widow Lingerie. Black Widow Weeds Removal Service. Black Widow Black Top Company. Black, Widow and Black Attorneys. " But not one single bank. Seems to be hung up on the word "black. " Maybe the Bat-Analyzing gears need oiling. - Yes, commissioner? -it's Black Widow, Batman. In lightning fashion, she's just hit four more banks and I have an office full of angry bank managers. Any results at your end? Not yet, commissioner, I'm sorry. But I'm almost tempted to let her Letter. Give me the names of the banks Black Widow has robbed. Chief O'Hara, that list. Excuse me, gentlemen, excuse me. Here you are. Ahem. Here we are, Batman. "American, Beneficial, Commercial, Diversified, Empire, Federal State. " It's simple as A-B-C, commissioner. Black Widow's going right through the alphabet. No wonder the Batcomputer couldn't figure out her plan. It was too easy. Commissioner, the next robbery will obviously take place at Gotham General Bank and Trust. Chief O'Hara, I want every available unit dispatched to the Gotham General Bank and Trust. -I have a better plan. Tell Chief O'Hara and his men to sit on their tuffets so to speak, and stay away from the Gotham General Bank and Trust. Repeat, stay away. Robin and I are less likely to frighten this spider away. Pardon me. Have you been here long, citizen? We're looking for Black Widow. I'm not too familiar with Gotham City or any of its denizens, Batman. Ciao. Ciao. May we see the manager, please, it's top priority. Do you wish to open a new account, sir? No, it concerns possible criminal activity in this bank. If you'll just follow me. Mr. Leghorn, uh, two gentlemen to see you. T-two gentlemen? No lady or Black Widow or anything like that? Batman and Robin here, Mr. Leghorn. Oh! Am I glad to see you. Mr. Leghorn, we have reason to believe Black Widow will attempt to rob this bank today. Oh! Oh. There's no cause for alarm, Mr. Leghorn. Robin and I will be hiding nearby. If and when Black Widow shows up, act naturally and do exactly as she says. - We'll apprehend her at the right moment. -If you say so, Batman. Act naturally. Well, we watch and wait. Steady, Robin. It's her move. Caught you, Black Widow. Thought you could rob the Gotham General Bank? - Well? -Mr. Leghorn, please! I thought I told you to act naturally. This is Mrs. Harriet Cooper one of Gotham City's most law-abiding and respected citizens. All I wanted to do was open a small savings account for my nephew Dick Grayson. Forgive me, Mrs. Cooper. Please let me explain. - Don't bother. There's always Beneficial. -Good for Aunt Harriet. All right, Mr. Leghorn, continue to act naturally. Act naturally. Act naturally. Act naturally. - M-may I help you? -How do you do, doll? I would like to open a small savings account. Oh, nothing pretentious. It's her. Let's move out. - Say, um -So, Black Widow, we finally meet. How perfectly thrilling. Ha, ha. The caped crusader. And what a magnificent cape it is too. I really must have one of those for my wardrobe. Don't waste your energy, Black Widow. Robin and I have been wearing anti-short circuiting brain Bat-electrodes since your first day in Gotham City. Really, my sweet? Well, now, how about trying this on for size. Bye-bye, baby. Au revoir, Prince Charming. Keep in touch. Batman? Feels like a paralyzing dose of spider venom. It should wear off presently. Let's go after her. She has a pretty good head start on us. I anticipated that. Robin, I installed an odor-sensitometer radar circuit. - Holy olfactory. -Right, Robin. The oil-and-gas mixture from her motor bike will register on the sensitometer and be picked up as a blip on the radarscope. All we have to do is follow that blip. - Ready? -Are you, Batman? Never readier. - We're on target, Batman. -But she seems to have disappeared. That elderly couple rocking on the porch. Maybe they saw her. Hello, citizens, sorry to trouble you. We're looking for a lady on a motorcycle. Have you seen such a lady? Haven't seen no lady on a bike in, let's see, been eight to 10 years. Wouldn't you say that, Dad? I would say that, yes. About eight, 10 years. We're still getting the blips. She must be somewhere around here. Say, aren't you that Bat fellow and that Robin fellow who are constantly fighting evil? - Right you are, ma'am. -Keep up the good work. Frank and I are both categorically against evil. Thank you, senior citizens. They're driving away. Ha. Black Widow, you've outwitted them again. Say, aren't you that Bat fellow and that Robin fellow who are constantly fighting evil? Sounds perfectly normal on the Bat-Tape Reader, doesn't it, Robin? Just the way it was picked up by the Batmobile's ultrasonic recorder. Activate the Bat-Scilloscope. Now let's watch and listen. Say, aren't you that Bat fellow and that Robin fellow who are constantly fighting evil? - No doubt about it. -About what, Batman? That what we heard at the old frame house were amplified human voices. To the Batmobile. Look, Robin. Three hours and they're still going strong. Thought they'd be off their rockers by now, eh, Robin? Yeah. Come on, Robin. Rubber. So the voice we heard on that recording was really sweet, little old Black Widow. Question, when you chase a spider, where does he or she usually hide? Answer, under the house. Darlings, we're about to play a dear little game. Spider and the fly. Come closer and pay attention. Strict attention. Robin, over here. Welcome to the web, darling duo. Sic them, boys. Ow! Batman! So, Latrodectus mactans, commonly known as Black Widow, caught in your own web, eh? There is nothing common about me, dynamic doll. And as for being caught in my own web may I give you a tiny, little piece of advice? If you wish to live and thrive let the spider run alive. Not a chance after all the evil you've done. Oh, well then, I'm afraid I must do another evil deed. Not tonight, unless you can arrange it from the Gotham City Jail. Batman, my arms and legs, I'm stuck. How ironic. Now it is you who are caught in my web. Frightfully cunning of me, don't you think? You may have a slight advantage now but Dear Heart, you may be caped and you may be dynamic but to me you are a crashing bore. So voila. I had them skip their dinner so they would thoroughly enjoy you. And now my lieutenants and I are going to tunnel into my vault and count our lovely loot. 
NARRATOR". Eleven o'clock in Gotham City and all is well. Or is it? Criminals prefer plying their trade under the cloak of darkness. And tonight is no exception. A catalog taken from a department store. A catamaran taken from the nautical society. Three mittens taken from a fancy apartment. Ha! What, uh--? What does that all spell out to you, O'Hara? T-R-O-U-B-L-E. Trouble. - The Princess of Plunder. -Catwoman. The saints preserve us. When facing an adversary like the Countess of Criminality there is only one man who can deal with and eventually overcome that threat to our security. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at stately Wayne Manor home of Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson astronomical events are taking place. Remember, Dick, don't look directly into the sun. It may cause damage to the retina of the eye. Right, Bruce. Gosh, isn't it exciting about the eclipse tomorrow? A few countries are sending geophysical teams to observe the phenomenon. - Ahem. Uh, sir'? - Hmm? It's the Batphone. - Yes, commissioner? - Batman. We have every reason to believe that Catwoman is alive and living in Gotham City. We'll be right there, commissioner. Catwoman has returned to besmirch the name of our fair metropolis. To the Bat Poles. "And the three mittens came from the 10th floor apartment of Andrew S. Kitten. " Ha. "Parent of triplets. " - Gotham City's father of the year. -Right. But there's one significant fact that these crimes have, all three are cat-oriented. But what does it all mean? It means, Chief O'Hara, that Catwoman has something big up her paw. However, this is only a portent of crimes to come. The Marchioness of Misdemeanors is a wily opponent. What'll we do? You'd set a thief to catch a thief, you'd set some cheese to catch a mouse. To catch this breed of cat, you'd set - A bird. -Correct, Robin. And what kind of bird? A canary. You've done it again, old chap. I hope it works, Batman. She's a pretty hip cat. No matter how cunning and crafty they are, Chief O'Hara eventually all criminals commit the same error, over-confidence. Let's go, Robin. O'Hara I have grown to realize that there are two basics in life we can be sure of. Death and taxes, sir? Batman and Robin. This woman is bright and clever. No matter how much she's involved in her treacherous schemes she must keep in touch with reality. A false newspaper story. A few weeks ago I met the man who writes the most widely-read gossip column in the country. Jack O'Shea oi the Gotham City Times. Right, a straight news plant might be too conspicuous but a small blurb in his column might do the trick. Is he worthy of our trust? That's hard to determine, Robin. He's a bit too theatrical for me but we must make every effort to bring Catwoman to justice. Are you gonna call him at his newspaper office? This Jack O'Shea is rather unique. His office is the third phone booth in Glob's drugstore. We should have the number in the Bat index. Yeah, ring me tomorrow, Fred. Dolly. Hey, Poopsie, make me a corn beef on white, heavy on the mayo. Two glasses of buttermilk. Your dime. Mr. O'Shea, this is Batman. Who? We met several weeks ago at the newspaper. You're putting me on. I wonder, could you do me a favor? Come on, who is this really? Hubbel, Leonard? This is really Batman. I'll be an out of work actor. Say, what can I do for you, Batman baby? Need a little free publicity? Ha! I'd like you to place an item in your column about a rare species of canary that's being exhibited on the 12th floor of the Gotham City Natural History Museum. Well, anything you say, Caped Crusader. Always glad to aid the Hooded Avenger. I appreciate that. Hey, why don't you and I have lunch together sometime? Perhaps. Goodbye. See you around. You are the crÃ©me de la crÃ©me of Gotham City's cat burglars. So why did we have to waste our time with those dumb robberies? - Unh! -Never question my motives. Suffice it to say that 12 men applied for this job. All the others washed out when they were caught by the law. You proved your mettle when you escaped unscathed. I am in the process of selecting cat burglars for the greatest caper in crimedom's history. So, what is it already? In due time. In due time. Speak. O' SHEA". Catwoman, sweetheart. What's shaking, baby? Watch your language, knave. Remember, I'm a lady. Yeah. Right. Well, I've got some news that ought to raise the fur on your back. The Batman has arranged a trap. There's a rare canary on the 12th floor of the Gotham City Natural History Museum. I guess he figured you'd want to, uh, steal it. My, is that so? Good going, my perfidious printsman. Keep in touch. Yeah. Hey, why don't we get together and share a saucer of milk sometime? Don't be ridiculous. It would ravage my reputation if I were seen with you. Nobody wants to eat with me. Now. Pay attention. It's time for your lesson in window-jimmying. After this, we'll have a short recess and discuss Batman and Robin's upcoming funeral. - Are those the Batjets you told me about? -Yes, Robin. Each one contains enough compressed bat-jection to lift a 5000 pound automobile more than 500 miles in the air. We haven't tested them yet, but we may have to use them eventually. Batman, you think of everything. - Remember, the Boy Scouts' motto? -Be prepared. It would do well to keep that in mind at all times. I took the liberty, sir, of preparing you both a snack. How thoughtful, Alfred, but we must be gone. Crime waits for no one. Oh, but surely, sir, you'll take some nourishment. It's not conducive to good health to fight the forces of evil without proper supplies. Ah. As they say, an army travels on its stomach. Indeed, sir. Uh, I anticipated your haste. - I provided this sack. -Ah. Uh, it's always been my motto: "be prepared. " Truer words were never spoken. And if I may say so, sir, where are you off to? The Gotham City Natural History Museum. And we must get there pronto before Catwoman. - If my calculations are correct -They usually are. someone should be coming through that window within the next six seconds. Six, five, four You were right. Don't make a move, you light-fingered larcenist, consider yourself apprehended. Now wait a second, Batman and Robin. Is that fair, two against one? You're big, important crime fighters and I'm just a lowly cat burglar trying to eke out a living in this dog-eat-dog world. I'd hoped the Catwoman herself might materialize here tonight. If you'd just look behind you, you'll see that she did. Holy cliche. Does he expect us to fall for that? Ah, my tenacious teenager, you have a lot to learn. You witch. Batman, with all your many attributes you haven't learned the first thing about manners. A gentleman would kiss a lady's hand. You are not a lady. You are a-- Hss! Curb your tongue, Batman. I cannot tolerate a man with no breeding. All right, cats, get them. Enough. Enough! Cease this fiddle-dee-dee. - Are you ready to capitulate? - Heavens forbid. I just don't see the reason for any further violence. Especially since my side is losing. Holy weaponry. Look what she's got in her paws. I've got you covered with my cat darts. They've been dipped in catatonic, just enough to paralyze you for a minute or so. Holy D'Artagnan. You've made your point. Unh. What is she going to do with us? You can be sure her intentions are not honorable. I'm gonna throw you out that window. Twelve floors straight down. I hope you enjoy your flight. Do the deed and be quick about it. I hate long goodbyes. I don't believe it. What rotten luck. Put on your cat suits, let's get out of here. The fuzz will be stepping on our tails. Lucky we had Captain Ahab of the White Whaling Company put up these fishnets to catch the canary cage she might've tossed out the window. These nets sure saved our lives. Not luck, Robin, we were prepared. But it is true, some days one is luckier than others. I really hate to do this. This may give the caretaker quite a shock. "Gotham City's much beloved crime busters blew the duke last night when they allowed the Viscountess of Venality to escape their bumbling efforts. Now the question is, have the dynamic Caped Crusaders fallen on their masks?" What a scathing denunciation. Why would O'Shea be so vitriolic? Here's the one spalpeen we caught last night after the others got away. - He's all yours, Batman. -Thank you, Chief O'Hara. You might as well spill it. You can kick me, hit me and stomp me, but I'll never talk. All right, I'll talk. - Where's Catwoman's lair? - I don't know. They pick me up at my swank one room apartment blindfold me, then take me to her place. Any clues as to where it is? All I know is that I heard rock 'n' roll music in the background whenever I go to one of her lectures. Lessons in larceny. How despicable. And I used to hear a lot of people marching on the floor above my head. With a bunch of cats meowing whenever the music stopped. Heh-heh. Oh, yeah, one other thing. Whatever her caper is, she plans it for tonight. - Very well. Take him away, Chief O'Hara. -Come on. It's 10 a. m. If we're to figure out her plot, we better shake a boot. Let's go. Come on, Alfred, it's easy. Don't be an old fuddy-duddy. I'm afraid my dancing days ended with the Lambeth Walk, madam. Doctor's orders, you know, war injury. Heavens. Oh, boy. I like rock 'n' roll music as much as the next red-blooded average American teenager but this stuff is awful. It's the latest dance. They call it the Cattuzzi. By Benedict Arnold and the Traitors. It started a couple of weeks ago at a new restaurant on the west side called the Pink Sandbox. What are your specialties? Catburgers with catsup, Chicken Cat-atore and various cuts of meat from choice Kansas City cattle. If you'll come back in a moment, we'll give you our orders. All right. Holy epicure. Using this restaurant as a cover-up. Oh, she's smart all right. But this time we'll turn the tables on her. You were right, Robin, this must be the place. The early cat catches the Batman. Don't bother, Batman. This glass is shatter-proof, bulletproof and bat-proof. What are we gonna do, Batman? What are you gonna do? You're gonna die. I'm not just pussyfooting around this time, Batman. You can't frighten us with any of your threats, you feline Sorceress. Take heed, we shall overcome your satanic schemes. If we weren't on opposite sides of the law, Batman, I could go for you in a small way. You're about the only man I've met lately who'd be worthy of me. Holy lovebirds, I think she's sweet on you, Batman. The Joker called for a date last Monday. He's fairly attractive. But I can't stand his green hair. And the Penguin's too small for me. Your problem is you've been running around with a bad crowd. Enough of this moralizing, Batman. Nobody likes a preaching crime fighter. Batman and Robin your time has come. Prepare thyselves for the hotfoot to end all hot feet. Charlie, switch it on. Look at them dance, boys. It's amazing how two such athletic human beings can be so ungainly. We've gotta cool this floor down, or our feet will be severely burned. Holy bunions. Look, there's a water pipe. Little do they know that pipe contains liquid catatonia. Fumes will drive them batty and knock them temporarily out. Wake up, you birdies. I wouldn't want you to make your exits without knowing exactly how it's to be done. You hateful hussy. The reflectors have been greased with margarine to make you all the more fryable. Holy oleo. I didn't know you could yodel. - Have you no semblance of decency? -Not a shred. Thomas, Charles bring over the piÃ©ce de rÃ©sistance. Hot enough for you, Batman? You two guys are really hot stuff. Two minutes under this blistering heat and you'll be very well-done indeed. It's too bad it had to end now, guys but look at it this way, you will have starred in a new show. What's that? Bat on a Hot Tin Roof. That's not a bit funny. Well, you never did have much of a sense of humor, anyhow. Farewell. Farewell. I must depart and muster my forces for the final assault on Mount Gotham. At most, you have a few scant minutes before you either choke to death or get one of the worst cases of sunburn in history. 
It's 11 a. m and the graduating class at Aaron Burr High School has a very special speaker. But the one thing you must remember as you go out into the world to face the challenge of higher education in our great universities is always to obey the law and support your local police. Good citizenship is its own reward. There he is, Pussycat. Do your duty. He's kind of cute. Say, Why'd you get me involved in this anyway, Catwoman? Well, Batman has his protÃ©gÃ© and you're mine. But I'm just a rock 'n' roll singer. I'm not a crook. Oh, forget it. You're 20 years old. You're over the hill. Now, you just do as I tell you and scratch a way into his heart. Uh, excuse me. Can I help you, miss? My name is Pussycat. And I wanna be alone with you, Robin. Alone with me? But why? I can see a very important part of your education has been grossly neglected. That's a funny-looking outfit you're wearing. I could say the same for you, big boy. Anything in particular you want'? Only you, Boy Wonder. She's done it. Now, let's see if cataphrenic really works. Hello, baby. You're a real cute trick. - It works. -Yeah. Ha-ha. Ooh. Hey, fellas, there's Chief O'Hara. Look out. Hello there, Boy Wonder. Oh, who's your friend? - What's it to you, fella? -What? Get out of my way, or I'll give you a fat lip. What have you done to him, you little banshee? Come on, gorgeous. Frankly, I'm worried. Yes, commissioner. I don't know how to tell you this, Batman, but Robin-- Don't mince words, commissioner. I can take it. Well, Robin attacked Chief O'Hara today at the high school. Why would he do that? What was his reason? - He escaped before we could learn anything. - And Chief O'Hara? Well, he had the wind knocked out of him, but he's recovered. I'll be right there. It was as though the devil had taken him. He was trifling with some little red-headed girl and he answered my greeting by tripping me. Who could have put him up to such a dastardly deed? Chief O'Hara, had you ever seen this titian-haired wench before? - Never. - Mm. It could be we have a new villainess to wreak havoc on Gotham City. Well, now, that's hard to say, Caped Crusader. She couldn't have been more than 18, give or take four years. Kind of young for crime business. In today's rapidly changing world, one never knows. You can say that again. Before we set brain and sinew to this perplexing case let's review all the facts. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at stately Wayne Manor - Alfred? -Yes, madam? I know I shouldn't ask you this but why am I not allowed in Bruce's study? Uh, well, madam every man likes to have someplace that is, uh, a sanctuary. Far away from the, uh, if you pardon the expression, opposite sex. Now, uh, for those less fortunate than Mr. Wayne, it's the barbershop. For him, his study. A masculine retreat far from the threat of female encroachment. - Oh. -Stay right where you are and don't make a move. Robin, tie them up. Mercy alive. What's Robin doing with Catwoman? Same thought crossed my mind, madam. You-- You-- Shut up, old man. Ha-ha. Ooh. Never thought the day would come when Robin would be my sycophant did you? Oh, dear, is there anything left to believe in? - All done, Catwoman. -Good. Go help the boys blow the safe. What have you done to him? You-- You-- You-- He's under the influence of cataphrenic. A drug which reverses all the normal moral and ethical standards and causes a person to become the exact opposite of what he was before. So now he's just as pro-crime as formerly he was anti? Exactly. Now, my next move is to put Batman in the same condition. Stick with me, sweetheart. We're going places together. As soon as we get enough cash, we'll lay low across the border. Forget it. All this is working capital. We got a much bigger job to pull. - You're the boss, Catwoman. -Yup. What's wrong? I don't know. I feel dizzy. L Ah Probably a negative side effect from the drug. It should wear off in a couple hours. Spade, Marlow, Templar, take him and get out of here. Never mind. Give me. - Hello? -Oh, I'm so glad I found you, sir. Master Robin was just here with-- - With Catwoman. - Catwoman? - Catwoman? -Catwoman? Yes, sir. They proceeded to rob the wall safe of the housekeeping money. Two-hundred thousand dollars. Worst of all, sir, Master Robin didn't recognize me. He's under the influence of some drug that, uh, makes him, well, sir, quite a bully. It also causes amnesia and fainting spells. Mm-hm. It appears she has the power to cloud men's minds. Stay right where you are. Yeah. Commissioner it's worse than we thought. Where's Robin? Sleeping it off in the other room, Catwoman. He seems sort of fuzzy since we got back from Wayne Manor. Oh. Well, we just won't take him on any of our jobs. But as long as he's on our side, even in spirit, that'll keep Batman at a safe distance. What are you doing, Pussycat? I bought one of those background music records. Music? I just wanna hear how I sound. Marlow and Spade and Templar they've generously consented to be my test audience. I told you to forget about music. Now, either you're gonna be a singer, or you're gonna be an arch-criminal. - You can't be both. -Do I have a choice? No. You're too short. Anyway, you had your choice and you took it when I picked you out of that, uh, Milk Shake A Go-Go on the Sunset Strip. Ah, the Milk Shake A Go-Go. Sunset Strip. All right, sing. But I won't listen. Forget your past flings. Along the sand Let's walk the shores together now Yes, hand in hand It's gonna be fair weather now When the stars come out Stop to count them in the sky Warm California nights With the breeze blowing in Time for love to begin I would miss California nights If I went on my way Thinking now that I'll stay Ooh, baby Love you, baby Mm, baby Love California nights Always close as a kiss Nothing's sweeter than this And we'll spend California nights Enough. No more. Quiet. Nobody gets more applause than Catwoman. Ahem. That was very nice. - Have you gotten it out of your system? -For the time being. All right, we can concentrate on the problems at hand. - Which are? -We need another $800,000. And Batman. In that order. Batman? I thought you said we'd be in the clear with Batman as long as we have Robin. Well, I want more. I want Batman in my corner. Once we get him on our side, there'll be no end to our criminal activities. That's a tall order, Catwoman. About 6-foot-2. Well, I can do it. The first item on the agenda is a phone call to the commissioner. Pussycat, bring me the telephone. Oh. - Put her on my private line, please. - Yes, sir. What do you want, Catwoman? Plug me into the Batphone, if you know what's good for you. Now, look here, what do you think this is anyway? Stop fumfering and be quick about it. - Yes, commissioner? -I have a call for you, Batman. Hello, Batman. How are you feeling? I know you didn't call to ask about my health, Catwoman. What have you done to Robin? He's safe, as long as you do as I say. - Go on. - I plan to commit a series of robberies. Why are you telling me? Because if you or the police do anything to stop me I'll have Robin killed instantly. Catwoman I find you to be odious, abhorrent and insegrevious. Dealing with you has expanded my vocabulary, increased my word power, uh a whole lot. Now, if we could meet on neutral ground I'm sure we could come to a complete agreement. Don't do it, Batman. It's a trap. Are you listening, Commissioner Gordon? Tut-tut-tut. Don't you know that that's illegal? Ha-ha-ha. No deal, Catwoman. All right. It's curtains for Robin. La-di-da-di-da-la-la. Dreadfully sorry, Batman, but I could scarcely contain myself. It's all right, commissioner. I understand. I must handle this in my own way. Don't be shocked by anything that happens and under no circumstances make any attempt to capture her. It may mean Robin's life. Why are we only stealing cash? Because, my dear Pussycat, I must raise $1 million in small bills to purchase plans of the Gotham City Mint. The mint? Wow. You always did think big, Catwoman. Why not? Hm. I'd get the same prison term for knocking over a hot-dog stand. When you're a 12-time loser it doesn't make much difference what you steal. Go see if Robin's ready to move. How much? - Only a hundred thou, Catwoman. -Oh. Add it to the 2 we got from stately Wayne Manor and we're still 700 thou short of our goal. Well there are a couple of people around town who are known to keep large sums of money. We'll have to hit them for that. Robin is dead to the world. I had to put a mirror to his mouth to see if he was still breathing. Ah, probably gave him an overdose. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, tabbies. Pussycat, guard the money. NARRATOR". And in the decrepit loft apartment of the world's richest and cheapest inventor, Pat Pending Rudy, I've got it. Ha-ha! I perfected the formula for our universal solvent. Oh, that's real good, Mr. Pending. - But what are you going to keep it in? -What? If it's really a universal solvent, it'll go right through every container. By George, you're right. - Yes. -I never thought of that. And you can give up any thoughts about your perpetual-motion machine. Never. It'll be a boon to humanity. No, it won't. It'll put millions of people out of work. What happens when parts don't need to be replaced anymore? Think of the machinists and lathe operators and folks like that who'd be on the breadline. Rudy, besides being a good valet, you're a genius. Thanks, Mr. Pending. Well, at least I still have one thing. My money- I don't know, Mr. Pending. Sometimes I think your money would be safer in a bank. Sometimes, Rudy, you're too negative. You heard the news on the radio. Was that money in the bank safe from Catwoman, huh? Here on the 10th floor of this old warehouse, we've got the best bank of all my mattress. Get them. Any stocks or bonds missing? No, no. I woke up when they were gathering the money. Catwoman specifically indicated cash. My cash. Said her contact demanded small bills only. Did she have anything else to say about her contact? Mentioned something about a prince getting weighed. Whatever that means. A prince getting weighed. Huh. Do you know what? I think I've got it. Tomorrow morning, Prince Ibn Kereb of Gedallia has his annual weighing-in ceremony in his embassy ballroom. - It was in this morning's paper. -Of course. They weigh the prince on one side of a scale and they pour paper money on the other side. - Yes. -I read it too. And when the weight of the money equals the prince's weight they turn it all over to the orphans of the country. Fantastic. Let's go. We must notify Batman. - You bet, commissioner. To the elevator. - Yes. NARRATOR". And the next morning, Prince Ibn Kereb is getting weighed. This is a surprise attack. Now, you all have your instructions. - None of us have watches. -Ah-- Just get the money and run. - How are you feeling, Robin? -Hm. Mm, perfect. You're learning. Get the loot, Robin. Everyone else, freeze. Don't do it, Robin. She's got you under her spell, Robin. Who's the character in the ridiculous costume? Ha-ha! That's Batman. Don't you recognize me, Robin? What a dastardly development this is. Stay out of this, men. I'd rather do it myself. Oh, my money! My money! Hey, stop them! Stop them! Oh, the money. - My money! That is my money! -Shut up. - Allah! Oh, my money. Ha-ha. Now that I have dispensed with your men, Catwoman your turn has come. Not yet, Batman. - Robin? -Yeah. Ha. Slay the blue dragon. Groovy. Oh, no. Heh. Oh, yes. Come on, cats. Everyone into my Catillac. NARRATOR". Across the bridge in New Guernsey lies the Catlair West. Ah, Batman's on my trail. I can feel it in my whiskers. Well, we'll have to get ready. Wake up. Uh Get me the electric cattle prods. Yeah. And turn them up full volume. Oh, boy, is he in for a shock. Commissioner Gordon, I seem to have found a second Catlair. This could be a trap, but I'll have to chance it. Robin's life is at stake. Of course I'll call you. Holy nick of time. Am I glad you showed up. Good boy, Robin. You've been playing possum. And all the time I thought you'd become a turncape. Oh. Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Would I do that to you, huh, Batman baby? Great Scott. I-- Batman. If you agree to help me, I'll let you up. If not Robin will cut the rope, the steel bar will snap and you'll be divided into equal parts. In other words, heh you'll be beside yourself. I'll never be your partner, Catwoman. Oh. Ho-hum. Boy Wonder, start cutting. 
Batman Gotham City. Metropolis of wonders. Architectural queen of the world. A new jewel is about to be added to her crown. Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. The mightiest bridge in the world 'becomes a part of our city. ' I hereby dedicate this engineering triumph the Amerigo Columbus bridge. 'And in Wayne Manor' 'stately home of millionaire Bruce Wayne' 'and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson. . ' Bruce, quick. Come here and look. 'What is it, Dick?' In the crowd there. I just saw the Bookworm. - Are you sure? - How can I mistake him? Those crazy clothes that look like rare old book bindings. And I'm pretty sure he had on his trick eye-glasses, too. The ones with the secret radio stuff built in. Strange. What would a crook like the Bookworm be doing at the dedication of a bridge? Let's watch. Maybe he'll show his nasty nose again. Bookworm to Printer's Devil. 'Bookworm to Printer's Devil. ' Start chapter one. 'Devil to Bookworm. Got you boss. ' Holy homicide. - 'Tell me it's a nightmare. ' - 'Steady, Dick. ' It happened, all right. Commissioner Gordon killed. This is one time we don't wait for the Bat-phone. Oh, my dears, my dears. I was watching in the music room. Did you see it, too? We did indeed, Aunt Harriet. I just hope they were watching the television. 'They?' Batman and Robin. 'Who else can save us now?' Don't worry, Aunt Harriet. I guess there's not much those two miss. Come on, Dick, let's drive into the city and pay our respects to a late, great man. Right, Bruce. It's the least we can do. I solemnly swear by my oath as a crime fighter that this outrage will not go unavenged. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na Batman 'Look, what'd I tell you?' Yes, it's the Bookworm, alright. Why, you pasty faced devil. If I could only get me mitts around your neck I'd strung ya. You-- Pull yourself together, Chief O'Hara. The mere fact that he was at the scene is no proof of guilt. Outrage. Worst insult I've ever suffered in my whole life. Miss Williams, please. What are you up to? Gentlemen, back to your departments. Saints alive. Holy reincarnation. Youweren't at the ceremony at the new bridge, commissioner? I was not. Thanks to a monumentally stupid police officer who gave me a ticket as I left my luncheon. Me! Arrested for overtime parking! 'Chief O'Hara. ' Are you anxious to be transferred to the department of sanitation? No, sir. May I see that ticket, commissioner? "Badge number 18-8-7. " "Signed by, A. S. Scarlet. " Wait. There is no badge 18-8-7 on the force. Of course not. A. S. Scarlet stands for "A study in scarlet. " A Sherlock Holmes adventure novel first published in 1887. What a typical, twisted, Bookworm joke. Bookworm? Say, what what is all this? Why are you here, Batman? To investigate your murder, my friend. - What? - 'At the bridge, this morning. ' There was an imposter made to look like you. He was apparently murdered by a rifle bullet and fell into the river. Good grief. Then, that so called policeman who pinched me-- Another phony. Right, Robin. A mere illusion of death, commissioner. Performed by an expert high diver in Bookworm's pay. But why? What on earth was the point of that charade? I don't know. It could have been-- The bomb detector of the Batmobile. It's flashing red. Quick, hit the radio control ejector button. Holy explosion. 'Printer's Devil to Bookworm headquarters. ' 'Devil to Bookworm. ' 'Devil to Bookworm. ' I read you, Printer's Devil. 'Plot A, washout. ' 'He got rid of the bomb' 'with a tricky ejector. ' What about plot B? I don't know, Bookworm. It's still up in the air. It-- Ah, there it comes now. What condition is it in? Is my plot B legible? Perfectly. And here come the bat-eared boobs, too. Return to headquarters. I read you, over and out. Batman, look. Strange. A scorched, powder-burnt, book cover. Seems to be made of asbestos. Excuse me, sir. Did you see where this came from? Out of the sky, Batman. Just after that explosion. Typical of the Bookworm to place his lethal weapon inside a book. Bookworm? Sorry, citizen. Police business. You'd better move along. Good luck, Batman. Thank you. You could still read the cover. "For whom the bell tolls, by Ernest Hemingway. " It's the grimmest warning we've ever had. Warning? Hemingway's title. It's from a poem by John Donne. "Do not ask for whom the bell tolls. " "It tolls for thee. " Phew. No clues here, Batman. No secret writing. It's just what it looks like. A perfectly ordinary asbestos book cover. Darn it all. I'm still positive there's some reason why he chose this particular book. Maybe it was the only one of right size. No, Robin, no. You see, I know how this fiend's mind works. He prepares every super-crime like the frustrated novelist he is. Every page, every chapter is an integral part of one stolen plot. Even that charade at the bridge this morning. . Great heavens. Of course. The bridge. What, Batman? In "For whom the bell tolls" the hero's mission is to blow up a bridge. Holy detonator. Let's go. What is a super-crime, boss? Silence. Back to your books. You'll be told in good time. Oh, you're some clever worm, Bookworm. Oh, oh. It's books, my sweet lady. Books, books. That's the secret of my success. Books. Oh, I read them all. I inherit the wisdom of the ages. Every plot ever devised is here. Inside my head. Oh, Bookworm. With a mind like yours I wonder why you don't write your own bestseller. Shut up! Oh, don't you dare say that to me. You-you're taunting me, aren't you? - No, Bookworm. - Yes, yes, you are taunting me. And why? Why? Because I have no originality, that's why. Why? Because I am only the master of stolen plots. Well. Well, thisthis will teach you a lesson. Hmm. Psst. What is he doing? With his fantastic mind he will read that entire book in a matter of seconds. Now. What was I saying before I was interrupted? Oh. Dear me. What feeble memories you have. Heh. However. . shades of Shakespeare. Night has fallen. It is time for us to put a little twist into our plot. Follow me. There's one thing I don't dig, Batman. Why does Bookworm wanna blow up the new bridge? What's he getting out of it? Perhaps nothing but twisted revenge. Revenge against a well regulated society with. . Look. On that cloud. 'Wow. The Bat-signal. ' Batmobile here. Thank heavens, Boy Wonder. A strange occurrence has just been reported. 'Where and what?' Back to that huge old warehouse on Harbor Avenue. It involves a bridge. Say no more, commissioner. We're on our way. Old warehouse, Harbor Avenue. Hold tight. Emergency Bat-turn. Robin, alert parachute pickup. Parachute pickup. Holy magic lantern. And a minced picture of the new bridge. Yes, he's blown it up all right. That photograph of the bridge. It's hugely enlarged. Blown up, in photographer's lingo. Gosh. What a tricky play on words. - What's Bookworm's game? - I don't know, Robin. The first thing is to find out where that hidden photo projector is. Let's climb the wall and get a bird's eye view. No. Wall's too high to use the Bat-ropes. Let's use the Bat-zooka. 'Pressman to Bookworm. They're getting ready to climb the wall. ' Bookworm to Pressman. Return to Bookmobile. Fire. - Holy bullseye. - Let's go. I have the curious feeling this all some kind of literary plot. Let's outwit him, Batman. Let's refuse to bite. We must, Robin. It's the-- Are you Batman? Oh, you must be. 'Cause that's Robin. Hi, Robin. 'Yes, citizen, but don't be alarmed. ' 'We're here on official business. ' Holy human flies. This ought to be high enough. Look. Down there, in that other alley. Careful, Robin. Both hands on the Bat-rope. - Sorry, Batman. - You're right, though. The source of this giant projected blow-up seems to be coming from the roof of that parked van. Reverse Bat-climb. Odd. An abandoned Bookmobile. Could it really be one from the Gotham City Public Library? I doubt it. Not with that photo projector built into the roof. 'I doubt whether it's entirely abandoned, either. ' You're right, Batman. There must be someone inside to tend the projector. Let's give the worm a turn. We'll use the ultrasonic Bat-ray. Bookmobile right in the sights, Batman. How many decibels will we give 'em? to be sufficient. Here we go. - That's flushed them out. - 'Six of them, two of us. Odd's in our favor. Hiro Jiwa's "Art of the attack. " Page 14, chapter 6, paragraph 2. Into action. Your glasses. Remember, never hit a man with glasses. Shakespeare, once more unto the breach. 'Machiavelli's. ' The cowardly worms. Where are they going? Where worms always go. Down into the earth. They've wiggled through that secret trap door. Doubtless, they had it all prepared. But why, Batman? Why lure us here and then run? Good question, Robin. One that's baffled us from the very beginning of this case. Why? Perhaps there's a clue to be found on that Bookmobile. Holy Cinderella. A beautiful prisoner. Just like a fairy tale. Let's free her. No. Wait a minute, Robin. Criminals have tried this trick before. - Trick? - Shh. Shh. The girl. Could be one of Bookworm's gang disguised as a prisoner to give us false information. Gosh, Batman. Those look like honest eyes. Huh. Never trust the old chestnut that crooks have beady little eyes. It's false. I say we subject her to the most rigid test. You mean, the Bat-cave? Precisely. I regret this but it's a precaution I must take. I'm going to put you to sleep for a little while. I give you my word there will be no harmful after-effects. Whatis your name? Lydia Lympet. 'Do you know where you are?' Of course. I'm in the back of Bookworm's Bookmobile. It rings true, Batman. She doesn't even realize she's in the Bat-cave. Get set for the big one. What is Bookworm's plot? I don't know. He hasn't confided it to us. Darn it all. Another true answer. I only know he can't pull it off till Batman and Robin have perished. Turn that machine off. What are we gonna do, Batman? Only one thing we can do. And quickly, before that Bat-gas wears off. She's waking up. Batman? Oh, thank heavens, you've rescued me from that slimy fiend, the Bookworm. Any idea what his plot is, ma'am? Oh, yes. I overheard it all. He plans to strike at midnight. Where, ma'am? It's just awful. You know that perfect replica of Independence Hall? 'The one built for the exposition?' Well, he plans to steal the priceless documents there. The original. . United States. . Declaration of Independence. This poor girl's had a very bad time. We better call an ambulance on the mobile Bat-phone. Batman, Robin, please don't leave me! - Another trap, of course. - You could say that again. Another trap, and I intend to walk right into it. What? It's the only way, Robin. We know The Bookworm's waiting there. With his shotgun loaded for bats. True. But he doesn't know that I know. You stay here and guard that crooked girl. I'll call Chief O'Hara en route and have him send reinforcements. Ambulance on the way, ma'am. Won't be long, Miss Limpet. While we wait. . why don't you untie me, hmm? I don't know if I should. I mean, you might be injured, Miss Limpet. Better not move until trained personnel arrives. Well, then, how about reading me a book? Say that fourth one on the end of the shelf. Sure thing, Miss Limpet. - This one? - No, no, no, the next one. "Complete English history?" This kind of stuff always puts me to sleep. Limpet to Bookworm, urgent. 'Do you read me? Am I legible?' 'Repeat. Am I legible?' Ahem, I read you. Warning. Batman knows it's a trap. Uh, how could he? I don't know. But get this. The Boy Wonder knows my name. He's been calling me Miss limpet. 'They must've tumbled somehow. ' Uh, look, do you still have Boy Wonder? Oh, yes. He got a whiff of your sleepy-bye book "English history. " Stay right there. I'll be right over to pick you up. 'Over and out. ' A strange destination for a dreadful fate. The Wayne Memorial clock tower. Presented to Gotham City in memory of Bruce Wayne's father. 'Time. Time. ' 'Which delivers us all to the worms in the end. ' What time is it? Oh. One minute to midnight, Bookworm. Ah! Sixty tiny seconds. Oh, farewell, Boy Wonder. 'Adieu, Robin. Oh, this is the last time you will meddle' 'in affairs of moment. ' Oh, I tried to warn you. "Do not ask for whom this bell tolls. It tolls for thee. " Holy headache! Holy midnight!

NARRATOR". A warm, serene afternoon in Gotham City. The merest hint of a breeze ruffles the leaves of the majestic trees that inhabit the back lawn of stately Wayne Manor. Scarcely the moment for crime to rear its ugly head. Press on, merry marksmen. We've much to do ere night descends. Hyah! I've run it up the flagpole back at home base, Mr. Wayne and I'm not sure we should award the money to the poor denizens of Gotham City. -No? As administrative head of public relations, I recommend against it. You realize, Mr. Dale, that the foundation had already decided for it. But with this arch Archer criminal traversing our byways -Oh, yes, Archer. I wonder if that much cash will be safe. Mr. Dale, as chief trustee of the Wayne Foundation I can assure you that it is entirely safe. Gotham City is in no danger from criminals. Stand back whilst I have at it. The legal tender awaits our liberation. - Do we take our leave? -The quicker the more advisable, sire. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Well put, sire. A quote from some obscure playwright. Thank you, Archer. You've kept the wolf from our door. You're all heart and a yard wide, Big John. Aw, bless the ground that you cry on, Mr. Tuck. Uh-oh. Egads! We are on the verge of incarceration. Fear not for I have prepared a sneezing powder arrow to harangue their nostrils. Let us make our egress with the utmost dispatch. Hyah! I shall secure him without further delay, sir. Was, uh, anyone hurt? No, it was a rather mild gas with hardly any aftereffects. Our butler, Alfred, was out shopping for the morning and revived us with smelling salts. There's that little business in the study, sir. - Oh, yes. -Golly. - Uh, please excuse us, Chief O'Hara. -Yes, yes. Yes, commissioner. I've heard from Chief O'Hara that The Archer, that rapacious rapscallion has returned to taunt the people of Gotham City. - Yes, and he robbed the home of Bruce Wayne. -How did you know about that, Batman? It's my business to know. We'll come right in. To the Batpoles. - They distributed the money to the poor? -Most of it has already been turned in. Once the people of Gotham City knew it was stolen, they wanted no part of it. A tribute to their character and moral fiber. This Archer seems to have you at his mercy. That malfeasant marksman. I'm going to tell the trustees at the Wayne Foundation not to make the proposed grant. - Why not? -We're chatting about $10 million in cash money being distributed through our annual poverty program. We must make sure that the millions won't end up in the hands of that blackguard. The Wayne Foundation is doing a wonderful job supplementing the administration's policies. And with Batman and Robin on our side you can be sure no harm will befall that money. Stand back, everybody. This could be one of Archer's tricks. - Oh, my eyes! - I'm blinded! - I'm blind, sir. I'm blind. - I can't see. My eyes. I'm blinded. - Blackguard! - Chief! Now heed this. I'm gonna rob from the rich and give to the poor. How unoriginal. - I came to warn thee, all of thee. - I can't see a thing. I don't want anybody interfering with my robbing or giving, understand? Or the poor people in Gotham City will rise up and revolt. To them, I am the spirit of benevolence and I will brook no interference. - Let's get him, Batman. - Get back, I say! Let us depart, Archer. We've nary an excess moment. Batman, where are you? A fond cheerio. A bit of a tweet-tweet, and a pip-pip and pleasant dreams. There they go around the corner. Let's see if we can catch them. He certainly is a spectacular man. That he is. And the Boy Wonder is pretty good too. I was talking about The Archer. A good publicity campaign and he'd replace Batman as the public's favorite. Understand this, Mr. Dale. Someone might be able to substitute for Batman for a very short time but no one could ever replace him. That Archer sure is a tough cookie, Batman. "Stale" is a better adjective, Robin. Hey, who are you? He must be new in Gotham City. He's from Philadelphia. - How did you know? - You dipped your diphthong. People from Philadelphia are known for that. We're Batman and Robin, the crime-fighters. Are you a vocal group? I beg your pardon. I thought perhaps you might be a singing duo, the, uh, outfits and all that. No, we're duly deputized officers of the law. You may return to your business, citizen. Holy Houdini! They've disappeared. Excuse me, miss. Have you seen three men on horseback riding in this neighborhood? Three men on a horse in downtown Gotham City, Batman? I think you've been working too hard. Thanks anyway, miss. Your marksmanship, for a fortnight now we have robbed the rich and given to the poor. Aye, and with nary a doubloon for our own pocket. Hath not the time arisen for personal profit? Patience and hold thy tongue. We have one more crime to commit before the big caper. I wish youse guys would quit talking so funny and get down to business. Batman and Robin will get youse and I'll have blown two weeks driving a truck. Cease and desist, woman. I have other things on my mind. I must devise a plan to pry the location of the Batcave out of Batman and Robin. Uh, why doth that make any difference? It is rumored that those caped sheriffs of Gothamham hath a machine that can predict any criminal's next ploy. We must seize and destroy said machine or suffer the consequences. Marilyn, call Commissioner Gordon. Yes, I've got it. The Archer will be distributing money to poor people at the corner of Neptune Avenue and Twentieth Street at precisely 4:00. Thank you for your help, miss. Well, O'Hara, this may be the break we've been waiting for. Are you gonna call the Dynamic Duo, sir? Wouldn't you? Say, what is this? Mr. Bannister, thy time has come. If you didn't get your change back from one of my candy machines take it up to the complaint department. -Gentlemen, string thy bows. If it's about the coin shortage, I swear, I'll put them back into circulation. Not nearly so fast as we shalt. - Now, sire? -Now. Hey, everybody, come on now! Hooray for Archer! Come on, everybody. Boo the Batman. Come on, everybody. Boo it up. - Phooey on Batman. -Batman. Batman! Phooey on Batman. Phooey. A fine bunch of creeps youse guys turned out to be. With your fancy talk and everything. What ingratitude. That's what I get for aligning myself with a kindergarten dropout. The town is in an uproar, Batman. The Archer has been glorified by everyone. And the poor folks have pooled their pennies to make his bail. Fifty thousand smackers in milk bottle deposit money which probably would have gone for food. Don't they understand how he's trying to fool them? That elusive lure of easy living. Talk about fooling all the people all the time. The Archer made this statement just after he was bailed out. Thank thee compatriots of Gotham City. Thank thee for thy faith. Let it be now known to one and all, I have foresworn my deeds of the past. Rich people of Gotham City, thee may quake no more in thy boots. Yea and verily, I shall no longer rob thee. I've programmed the Batfile of addresses to look up any variation of the word "Archer. " Ofttimes a criminal will be listed under a nom de crime similar to his own. Nope. All of those are legitimate people. What was it that Allan A. Dale said about Archer? The people think he may be another Robin Hood. Ah. And what was Robin Hood's real name? I've read about that in English class. He was also known as the, uh, outlawed earl of Huntington. Mm. Let's see what the Batfile has to say about that. Look. There it is. An archery range owned by Earl Huntington. And Sherwood Avenue is in the Green Forest section of Gotham City. This might be what we're looking for, Robin. I hope so. We've got to expose him before he does even more damage. - Right. -But how? How what, Master Robin? The Archer has sworn never again to rob from the rich and give to the poor. But he had nothing to say about robbing the poor to make himself rich. You think that may be his overall plan? And I wouldn't be surprised if it ultimately involved the Wayne Foundation grant. Heaven forfend. Alfred, in your youth, you were familiar with the long-, the short- and the crossbow, were you not? Yes, indeed, sir. I was known as the William Tell of Liverpool. And you've been prepared to join us in our crime-fighting, have you not? To serve you in any capacity, sir, has always been my duty and my pleasure. Excellent. While Robin and I are finding Archer's hideout here's all you need to do. Ah. I, uh, should like to purchase a few shillings worth of arrows. Doth thou, uh, fancy thyself a bowman? Yes. Of the highest caliber. I've yet to meet a man who's my match. You may have met him now. Spoken like a true competitor. Mayhaps thou would care to make a small wager on the outcome? Ah. Would, uh, a pound note? Done and done. After you, sir. Thank you. - Doth the heathen have a chance? -Not a smidgeon. Archer will soon puncture his confidence. You know something? Youse guys ought to use American titles under youse when youse talk. Like in the foreign pictures. Holy Inquisition. This is about the most frightening chamber of horrors I've ever seen. Let's just hope that Alfred can keep them busy while we take strategic positions and wait to trap them. Mediocre, sir. Watch some superior bowmanship. We lose more arrows that way. Let us continue. First man who misses splitting an arrow is the loser. Hey, Archer. Somebody's fooling around in your playroom. The signal just went on. Uh-huh. Then take the necessary measures. - We've been trapped. - Not yet. I'll cut us free with my Bat-knife. Well, thank you so much for a very fine afternoon's sport. But, uh, I have to be going. Heh. - Upon my soul. He doth wish to leave. -Doth thee indeed? Yes, I do. Yes. I have a pressing engagement elsewhere. Not by the hair of thy chinny chin chin. I believe thou were sent here to occupy our time whilst someone scoured our underground hideaway. Extraordinary idea. No, no, no. I-- I'm merely an innocent bystander. If that be the case, fear not. Thou hath nothing to fear but thy life. Seize him. But I-- I've tried every devious trick in my quiver of terror but thou still refuseth to disclose the location of the Batcave. You'll have to kill us before we tell you where the Batcave is. Methinkest thou speakest a stream of truth. Therefore, I will kill the innocent bystander in thy stead. Prepare him, gentlemen. Holy hostage. Don't let them do it, Batman. We'll have to leave that decision to the innocent bystander. I would rather lay down my life than impair the efficiency of Batman and Robin. Very well then. Go to it, lads. Happy landing, old man. Thou hadst a good head on thy shoulders. Whilst it lasted. You'll pay for this, you fiends. It was all for the best, Robin. How can you say that? Look. He's all right, and you knew it all the time. It's a guillotine often used by stage magicians. I recognized it at once. He was in no danger whatsoever. Very well then. Let the varlets down. Archer, I've been meaning to ask you about that machine. What is it? I purloined it from the castle of a television producer who makes alleged comedy programs. It can duplicate any laugh from a giggle to a guffaw and all the chortles and chuckles betwixt and between. But I've grown weary of this fiddledeedee. I entertain suggestions for their demise from my worthy aides-de-camp. Enclose them in a room full of imported California smog. They wouldn't last five minutes. I have a more engaging notion. Batman, I offer thee a sporting proposition. A fair duel on the field of honor. I accept that challenge. Maid Marilyn, start the machine forthwith. Gentlemen, 'tis time to offer them a bellyful of our steel. Shall we? - As you wish, sire. -Your wish is my deed. Let's smite the varlets. Ha! 
Batman Another exciting event in Gotham City. An unveiling at Madame Soleil's Wax Museum. A tribute to the city's most illustrious crime fighter. Thank you, Monsieur Mayor. Messieur the governor, the mayor and most honored dignitaries 'of Gotham City. ' I know you are anxious to see what I, the famous Madame Soleil have imported for you all the way from Paris, France. Mes amis, I unveil this wax figure of. . Batman. What is this ghastly travesty? Why, that's not Batman. That's the Riddler. 'Surprise! Surprise!' 'What is black and white and red all over?' 'Illustrious friends' 'if that little riddle is too hard for you' 'why, here's another. ' 'What has branches and leaves and no bark?' What did you say, Madame Soleil? The figure of Batman stolen? It's the work of the Riddler. Don't touch a thing. We'll take care of it. Well, you heard, chief. The Riddler is at it again. Two weeks out of jail, and he's up to his old tricks. I knew it was too good to last. There's only one thing to do. We may never know the identity of the man behind the mask. . but he's the only one who can cope with the Riddler. And in Wayne Manor stately residence of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson. He's just come in, sir. I'll get him for you. I thought Lima was the capital of Ecuador. Now as you can see, I was right. It's the capital of Peru. Oh, I just love this game of capitals. It's so educational. Not only that, if we don't know about our friends to the south how can we carry on our good neighbor policy? - Ahem. - Yes, Alfred. It's the Bat-phone, sir. Oh, Aunt Harriet, I forgot to tell you Dick and I are having dinner with an old college chum. He's promised to show Dick how to tie flies. He's an expert fisherman. Let's hurry, Dick, or we're gonna be late. Oh, those two. Hither, thither and yon. - Yes, commissioner. - The Riddler. - He struck again. - We're on our way. To the Bat-vault. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman 'What is black and white and red all over? He must be kidding. That's too easy. We figured that one out ourselves. By wonder, it's a newspaper. You know well how the Riddler likes to taunt us with these disguised clues. Clues that always reveal whatever plot he's hatching. This pause here is where the tricky paint gun went off. 'Illustrious friends. . ' Here comes the second riddle. 'if that little riddle is too hard for you' 'why, here's another. ' 'What has branches and leaves and no bark? Hmm?' That's all there is. There's always some definite connection between the answers to his riddles and his nefarious plans. What has leaves and branches but no bark? Hey! A book has leaves. But a book has no branches. Yes, but a library does! Then, the answer to the first riddle could have been book instead of newspaper. You've done it again, chum. The answer is library, but what library. If I know the Riddler it'll be the biggest library. The Gotham City Library. But what'd he want with a public library? We'll never find out standing here. Let's go, Robin! Meanwhile, in a secret hideaway beneath this innocent-looking candle factory. Oh. Oh, if only this were the real Batman? Oh! Tis' a consummation devoutly to be wished that this too, too solid flesh would melt thaw, and resolve itself into a dew. Oh, Riddler, honey, that's beautiful. I wrote it myself. Little did they suspect the real reason why I stole the wax figure of Batman. I knew, I knew those dull customs inspectors would never think of looking for this revolutionary new ring of wax universal solvent in the mannequin of their precious champion. Big deal. Wax is wax. What's so special about this stuff? Oh, you don't know my pretty little, Moth what universal solvent is. It can eat through anything. This remarkable wax can be found only in the hives of the Cognac district of France. No wonder the United States government has banned its importation. It might fall into the wrong hands. 'Why, with this illegally imported substance' there's no vault I cannot enter. Hear me, world. Nothing can stop me now. Ain't he ever gonna move? Yeah, we gotta get in the vault. Remember, it is better to light one little candle than to curse the darkness. Quickly, Moth. Batman's had time to solve my clue. Go downstairs and keep a sharp lookout. Okay. It won't be long now. That rare old book. The lost treasures of the Incas will soon be in my hands. Ain't somebody bound to hear us when we break into the vault? Don't talk, stupid. Why do you think I went to so much trouble to smuggle in this universal wax solvent? Hmm? Genius. So far so good. Ah! Go on. Now, remember, no writing in the margins. Heavens to Betsy! It can't be, but it is. The dynamic duo. Can I be of any help to you at all? Have you seen any unusual looking people around here? Unusual? In what way unusual? Their garb. For instance, a man wearing a bright green suit with big black question marks on it. Let me think a moment. No, I can't say that I have off hand. I see many people in the course of the day. We've serious reason to believe that a serious crime will be committed here. - 'We sure have. ' - 'Oh, dear. ' Where's the vault in which you store your most precious books? It's upstairs. Follow me. Boss, this is Moth. They're on their way up. I'll be ready for 'em. Hey, here it is, boss. Oh! Oh! At last I found it. This will lead me right to the lost treasure of the Incas. Every greedy bone in my body cries out, "Huzzah! Huzzah!" My stars! Look at that hole and the lock's gone. Careful, Robin, this looks like a robbery. Wait here, Ms. Prentice. As you can see, Batman, by the deadly weapons we hold you'd be fools to move. - What are you doing here? - Checking out a book. - Checking out a book? - Exactly, Boy Wonder. Lost treasures of the Incas. What'd he want with a book like that? Who can explain the devious mind of an arch criminal? You'll never get away with this, Riddler. Would you like to make a little wager? I never gamble. Holy mucilage! I can't move my feet! I'm stuck to the floor. Yes, it's my own concoction. I call it Dr. Riddlers Instant Forever Stick Invisible Wax Emulsion. Boss, you hit the alarm. An unfortunate error on my part, but lucky for you, Batman. Let's get outta here, boss. Since you'll be sticking around for a little while I'll leave you a riddle to work on. The more you take away, the larger it grows. 'What is it?' Look, they're gone! We must get out of this. I'll try the laser gun. What devilish sticky stuff. If only the Riddler's inventive mind could be channeled for good what a better world this would be. It's working, Robin. The wax is beginning to melt. 'Are you alright in there?' Yes. It's safe to come in now, Ms. Prentice. Oh! Saints above! How did that hole get there? - That's it! - What is it, old chum? The answer to that riddle. Don't you see? The more you take away from a hole, the larger it grows. You're right! What can that mean? - Unless. . - Yes? There's a strange waxy substance here. Could this be his clue? But how was this done? I heard no explosion. We must take this back to the Bat-cave at once and analyze it. Unless I miss my guess, I'm holding the answer in my hand. We've no time to waste. Let's get this sample of wax into the hyperspectrographic analyzer. This should tell us what makes up this waxy substance. Aha! It's just as I thought. Nitrogen is one of the component elements. That orange color. Doesn't that mean uranium? Right on the nose, Robin. You're catching on fast. No kidding, gee! But what about that blue line? That one's easy. It's sodium. Of course, this is a universal wax solvent. So that's how they got into that vault. If the Riddler left this as a clue I don't get it, do you? There's something here that escapes me. Nitrogen, uranium, sodium. What could it possibly mean? Well, if we take the first three letters of those elements it spells NUS, but that doesn't mean anything. Reverse the order and what do you have? SUN. Of course, that's got to be it. But what's it supposed to mean? Robin, I'm surprised at you. You're studying French in school. What's the French word for sun? - Soleil. - Correct. The Riddler has left us a clear indication of where he intends to strike next. Back at Madame Soleil's Wax Museum. What are we waiting for? Madame Soleil? Madame Soleil? It's Batman and Robin. Are you here? Such vandalism. What a disastrous unveiling this must have been. Boy, wax museums are sure spooky. You think the Riddler's here somewhere? For heaven's sake, caped crusaders, watch out! Ah! Good shot, boss. Ah, music hath the charm to soothe the savage beast. You sure soothed them, boss. You soothed them right to sleep with that thing. - They look dead to me. - Just drugged, my pet. Why kill them fast when watching them die slowly is so much more entertaining. Ah! Beauty after all. . is in the eye of the beholder. Ah! 'Well, what do you know?' A dividend I hadn't considered. What a haul this day has yielded. First the rare old book and the lost treasure of the Incas. Then, the invincible Batman and Robin and now. . the famous Batmobile for my very own. Watch it, boss. It's loaded with burglar alarm. Don't you think I know that? A little snip here. A little snip there. Now, it's safe to drive. You're gonna drive the Batmobile? Finders keepers, losers weepers as I always say. What do we do, boss? Take Batman and Robin out to the candle factory and I'll meet you there. We better get our everyday clothes back on. We look too suspicious this way. Sure, boss, just as soon as we get these two prized packages inside. Hey, look. Look, he's coming to. Oh, he, he looks so handsome beneath that mask. A Diamondback rattlesnake is a handsome creature too but dangerous and deadly. Remember, Moth, Batman is our sworn enemy. We can ill afford such emotions as pity. Where am I? Ah, you could say you're in the proverbial pickle, Batman. Take them in. Robin, do you hear me? Batman, what, what happened to us? It seems you have been overpowered again. But how? The last thing I remember, we were in the wax museum. We'd just passed the revolutionary war scene. You're getting warm. So that's how it was done. - How what was done? - Oh, it's so clear now. We were victimized by a repeating blowgun. Holy iodine! So that's why the back of my neck smarts. The wax is hot enough now, boss. If they want a life-like figure of their precious Batman for the wax museum, we'll give it to them. We'll even throw in a dividend. Robin! You fiend! Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me. Matches, start the motor. Slowly. Very slowly. Oh, I want to savor each sweet delicious moment of this. Got you, boss. Riddler, tell me why you removed my wax figure from the Madame Soleil's? How else could I smuggle in that revolutionary new ring of wax solvent? But why go to all that trouble? Wouldn't TNT have been much simpler? Have you ever been in a quiet library when TNT went off? It makes a frightening noise. Why did you steal that rare old book on the lost treasure of the Inca's? What possible meaning could a scholarly book like that have for you? For two people about to become human candles you have a lot of questions. I'm always interested in the way the criminal mind works. Well, then I'll tell you. Within that rare old book I found an ancient Incan riddle which will lead me right to the fabled lost treasure of the Inca's. You must be mad. The lost treasures of the Inca's is only a legend. Ah, but that's where you're mistaken, Batman. The treasure is real. Very real. But unfortunately you won't be around to see it. Infamy of infamies! Can this be the end of our beloved caped crusaders? Will Batman wax serious? For the sake of our heroes, let's think positively! But it looks bad, very bad. How can we wait until tomorrow night? Same Bat-time, same Bat-channel.

NARRATOR". As we last took leave of Batman and Robin The Green Hornet had been made into a rare stamp and then thumbtacked to a wall by the corrupt Colonel Gumm with Kato still being blocked and perforated in Gumm's shameful stamping machine, and the Dynamic Duo to follow. Once they're unglued from Gumm's glue pad for you, who've breathlessly waited and wondered some man-hours have passed. For the Caped Crusaders, mere moments as we shall see in a moment. NARRATOR". Kato, too, made into a man-size stamp and thumbtacked to the wall? What monster of a man is Colonel Gumm? And what monstrous mutilation faces our mantled man-hunters? Well, Dynamic Duo your turn. I think you will find us a much stickier proposition, Gumm. Not with another little invention of mine. Colonel Gumm's Super Instant Glue Gone. The invisible dissolving agent contained in this spray can will penetrate anything and anybody and will dissolve glue in an instant. Now, into the enlarged perforating and coiling machine to be stamped with my disapproval. Robin, the switch. - Now to remove this panel. -Why the panel? Because The Green Hornet and Kato are still alive inside this machine. Still alive? How could they be? - They're thumbtacked to the wall. -Shh. That should give them a chance to use their Hornet Sting. Quick. Into the truck with these cases of stamps. I'll get Miss Pinkston. We'll hold her as hostage. Meet me in the garage. - Gumm and his goons are getting away. -No, Robin, they've had it. They won't get far. Aah. Holy living end. It looked like the end there for a minute. But there was a small niche between the gum-applier and the perforating needles. -And we are both quite flexible. But there wasn't enough room to use my Hornet Sting to blast us out until that panel was loosened. How did the machine take your picture? No doubt an automatic image-orthicon of some kind. Wrong, Green Hornet. It was a high-velocity spectrobiscopic range reflector mini-unit. Hm. Uh, are you feeding that pink mutt my alphabet soup? Apricot was hungry, and she's only down to the Ds. - Come on. -No. - Yes. And blindfolded too. -No. - Ha-ha-ha! -Aah! How could you know they were alive in there? When this masked meddler was tossed in he had this gruesome gizmo with him. But you will notice, Robin, it is conspicuously missing from that giant stamp. Ergo, the high-velocity spectrobiscopic range reflector mini-unit failed to produce a true facsimile. Gosh, that's some "ergo," Batman. Yes, Batman, that's very clever, but it seems as if in saving us you've allowed our assailants to escape. None too smart for a smart crime-fighter. Are we just letting them go? As a duly deputized officer of the law, I had no tangible evidence to hold them on. But in giving them their heads, so to speak perhaps we can provide some tangible evidence shortly. Come on, Robin. - What's the matter? -I smell pink. - You're just tired. -No, I mean I really smell pink. The color pink. Pinky Pinkston. She wears Eau de Carnation, an expensive pink perfume. And she's been in here. There's no doubt about it. Probably looked up by her foreman before we arrived. What's that? I guess I'm tired but it looks like a bowl of alphabet soup. Robin, have you noticed the J's, Q's and Z's are missing? Holy uncanny photographic mental processes. Miss Pinkston expected Batman here tonight. No doubt she contrived to leave a message. In the soup? Gosh, Batman. It's sure a good thing you brought that empty alphabet soup Bat container. Right, Robin. The right tool for the right job. To the Batcave. Gosh, I never knew there were no punctuation marks in alphabet soup. - Yes, commissioner? -Batman, what a relief. We were a little afraid there might be some, uh, overdue postage on you. You must have found those man-sized stamps of The Green Hornet and his masked confederate in the stamp factory. Well, one of our men did on routine duty. You can tear the stamps up, commissioner. The Green Hornet is still very much alive and operating in Gotham City. What's the story, Batman? It's a long one, commissioner. I'll explain later. Right now, Robin and I are trying to work out another puzzle. Well, get back to work, by all means. Forgive the intrusion, sir, but Mr. Reid is upstairs. He'd like to see you. Ask Mrs. Cooper to keep him occupied, Alfred, a few minutes. - She, uh-- She's under the hair-dryer, sir. -Ah, yes. Hm. I'll be right there, Alfred. Keep trying, old chum. There's more letters in this alphabet soup than there are in the alphabet. - Hello, Britt. -Hi. If I'd known you were in there, I wouldn't have stood on ceremony. Well, it would be more comfortable in the living room here anyway. - Sit down, Britt. -Thanks. You're up early, aren't you? Yes, Bruce. I'm worried about Pinky. Nobody answered at her apartment or the factory. Do you suppose something could have happened to her? All that talk about The Green Hornet and Batman. Incidentally, uh, I should have told you this yesterday. I met Batman in Commissioner Gordon's office. - He sends his regards. -Very thoughtful. Uh, what kind of a guy is he, Bruce? An enigma. I really don't know him very well, Britt. But if he tangled with Green Hornet last night, Green Hornet would have gotten the worst of it. Well, that would be a switch. Heh. Green Hornet usually comes out the winner. That's because you have no Batman in your city. Oh. Well, maybe. Hm. But I'm still worried about Pinky. Well, Pinky seems to me to be a girl that can take care of herself. - Mm. Mm. -I wouldn't worry. - How was the convention last night? -Heh. Dull. How was the board meeting at the Wayne Foundation? Dreary. If you're going to be in town for a while, maybe we could dig up some excitement? Yeah, like old times. Ah, before we settled down into our mundane lives. Like old times. We had a few laughs, didn't we? Before we settled down and became such solid citizens. Yeah. Yeah, it's guys like The Green Hornet and Batman that see all the action, get all the kicks. Would you trade places with them? Well, not with Batman. I wouldn't be caught dead in that crazy cowl of his. It's impossible, Batman. I'm getting no place fast with this alphabet mishmash. We were a little offhand with the Batcomputer yesterday, Robin. I suggest we give it another chance. I'll just scoop these letters up. Hm. I think that's all of them. Bat funnel. Now the Batcomputer ingestor switches. You mean you're gonna feed those letters to the Batcomputer? They're made out of noodles. Easy to digest. It did it. "if anyone can decode this message Gumm is taking me to warehouse as hostage. Watch stamp exhibition tonight. Pinky Pinkston. " And not a J, Q or Z in the entire message. That's very clever of Miss Pinkston. I'll wager she fed all the J's, Q's and Z's to Apricot trusting we'd be able to unravel the clue. - Who's Apricot? -Her pink Maltese. Some of Bruce Wayne's female friends sound a little dizzy to me. But Miss Pinkston wasn't the only clever one. The Batcomputer even punctuated this. Yes, it seems to be back on the beam. Let's see if it can come up with the warehouse where Miss Pinkston is being held hostage. Yellow Pages. Don't tell me it's given up again. There's no dual identity in a warehouse. I think it's blown a Bat fuse All those noodle letters. No, Master Robin. The Batcomputer is not to blame. It's Mrs. Cooper's hair-dryer, sir. It short-circuited, and half the electricity in the entire establishment is off. And the telephones are out too. I've sent for a telephone repairman and an electrician, but it may take hours. And so because of a woman's vanity a battle may be lost. Lost? I'm surprised at you, Batman. Many battles have been won before electricity and telephone were ever invented. Gosh, Robin. You may be right. Just arrange to have the stamp exhibition in the Constellation Room tonight well-publicized. Then there's bound to be some action. And a Batclimb up Gotham Towers West will help us flex our muscles. Chin up, old churn. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, the scene of battle shifts to an isolated warehouse but warfare wages on in a strange and oblique manner. So Colonel Gumm is holding me hostage, Apricot? For what? Who's even going to know it, if he's killed The Green Hornet his masked companion and Batman and Robin? Word will get around, Miss Pinkston. Heh-heh. Mm. Reprint, this alphabet soup needs more consonants in it. Yes, Apricot, word will get around, all right. And it won't be composed of letters from alphabet soup. You know how it will be spelled out? Counterfeiter. Kidnapper. Murderer. As long as we're spelling things out, Miss Pinkston let me spell something out for you. Bruce Wayne was in the shop of his stamp dealer yesterday afternoon making inquiries about that missing stamp of your old man's. Do you suppose he means the Gotham Gothic, Apricot? And last night at the factory, The Green Hornet mentioned the same stamp and the same stamp dealer. Is he trying to tell me that Bruce Wayne is The Green Hornet? And I strongly suspect that Britt Reid is Batman. No, I could never believe that. Besides, how do you know what Bruce Wayne was telling his stamp dealer? - Because I-- -Hold it, boss. Don't spill any more beans. You're right, Reprint. Well, goodbye, Miss Pinkston. By the time you're found, if you're found I shall be thousands of miles away with a fortune that'll make your Pink Chip Stamps empire look like pink peanuts. Apricot, and this time I am talking to you, get to work on the ropes around my wrists. - Bruce Wayne's The Green Hornet? -And Britt Reid is Batman? - Incredible. -Unthinkable. Inconceivable. I'll call them both up at once. Call them over here and face them with it. Then that's good, isn't it, Apricot? If either Britt or Bruce arrive, then Colonel Gumm was wrong. For after all, Batman and The Green Hornet are dead. - Are they? -Are they? Oh, ho-ho. Oh, no, Miss Pinkston. No, they're not. I talked to Batman earlier today. He said it was a long story, and it must be. And then he asked me to publicize the International Stamp Exhibition this evening. He sounded very much alive. And he said The Green Hornet was too. Then there's really no use in calling either Britt or Bruce is there, Apricot? -Why not? Do you really think, gentlemen that either Batman or The Green Hornet would admit to anything after keeping their dual identities a secret for so very long? Begorra, she's right. - What do we do now, commissioner? -I don't know, Chief O'Hara. May I make a suggestion, gentlemen? - Of course. -Of course. By publicizing the stamp exhibition Batman may be intending to smoke The Green Hornet out, as it were. Let's get over to the Constellation Room at once. It'll be interesting to see who arrives, and who wins. And who's who. You seem thoughtful. We're heading for another clash with the Caped Crusaders, and I don't like it. Why not? We've never run away from trouble before. Yes, but this double identity poses extra problems this time. We know they're heroic crime-fighters, they think we're criminals. We must come out on top, but they mustn't suffer. Kung fu is kung fu. It's not child's play. I know, but our tricks are gonna have to be tempered with good judgment. You were right, Robin. This is a great way to limber up. Yes, there's nothing quite like a Batclimb. The Dynamic Duo. There are other ways of getting into this building. But none that provide the element of surprise that we need. What are you doing in Gotham City? Some of the paintings from my collection go on exhibit here tomorrow. I wonder if some creative artist couldn't capture the two of you on canvas. - Perhaps the Cubistic school. -Oh, never. - Pop art? -No. I think canned tomato soup is to eat, not to frame and hang on a wall. Dali? Picasso? Bit of an art buff yourself, aren't you, Batman? I'm afraid that crime-fighting allows me only the luxury of collecting criminals. But you should see the great mug shots we've got. - Robin-- - Uh, don't reprimand him. Who knows who posed for the Mona Lisa? Maybe one of the wickedest women in the world. Oh, but what a smile. NARRATOR". While in the Constellation Room, who's this dominating the stamp exhibition? It is a rare honor to have you here, Sefior Barboza. Heh. All the way from the Argentine. Heh-heh. I suppose your renowned Howling Monkey stamp - has been entered for one of the prizes. - -Ah, yes. Indeed it has, sefior. In fact, I expect to walk away with everything tonight. Well, it's time to get on with the judging and the prizes. - Right this way, Sefior Barboza. - Thank you. Now, quiet please. Quiet please. We have here, ladies and gentlemen, that famous stamp from Egypt The Inverted Blue Nile. Wonderful. There's Gumm in that phony disguise. The Green Hornet just came through the service door and the Caped Crusader through a window. I'm ready. Let's make our move. The Green Hornet! And the Caped Crusaders. Good thing those guys are on our side. Even though they don't know it. Good thing those guys aren't in town every week. NARRATOR". What do we have here? A Mexican standoff? A dead heat? A photo finish? Stand back. Come on. Now make way, come on. Stand back. Stand back. Ah. If it isn't the fuzz and the pink hostage. She'll come in handy. Out that window, boys. We'll come up behind them. Ah, Miss Pinkston - permit me to introduce myself. - Aah! Don't move, commissioner, nor you, chief. It's Gumm. Robin. If anyone makes the slightest move, Miss Pinkston will be a dead pink duck. All right, boys, outwith the loot. Batman can handle this. Let's go. Out the window, Robin. We'll come up behind Gumm. Here's your man. Miss Pinkston's foreman with assorted aliases and some sordid stooges. - We'll run him in. - Right. Take them out. The Green Hornet, he's gone. He certainly is. I wonder what he wanted in the first place. Piece of a counterfeit stamp ring. Or maybe he meant to uncover the entire ring. Who knows? The Green Hornet, a crime-fighter? Holy unlikelihood. Me, Batman? A lot of people think so, Britt, and that Bruce is The Green Hornet. Yes, sir. Immediately. Yes, Batman. Commissioner, do me a favor. Miss Pinkston's in the community room. Would you call her on your regular phone and then hold the two phones together? Oh, certainly, Batman. Oh, yeah. 869 447. I wonder what's keeping him. - Call for you, Miss Pinkston. -Thank you. - Hello. -This is Batman. - Batman? -Yes, Miss Pinkston. I wanna thank you for cooperating with me and your police department and running down your felonious foreman and apparently chasing The Green Hornet out of town. I did nothing, Batman. But it was sweet of you to call. Goodbye. Good bye. Now does that disapprove your ridiculous theory? I guess it does. Oh, here comes Bruce now. Please don't tell him, he'd think I was an awful fool. That he would, Pinky. Sorry, my car keys were in my pocket all the time. Now, Apricot, as you were saying Bruce, you nut. Talking to a dog? 
NARRATOR". Gotham City, a glistening jewel in a sun-filled landscape on a day when all seems right with the world. But in stately Wayne Manor, some of life's answers still prove elusive. Gosh, Bruce, I'm not really sure how important it is to know the maximum number of pieces a pie will yield after six cuts. Well, if you had a house full of guests and only one pie you'd find it was important. The trick to this pie puzzle, Dick, is to discover a rule that will give you the maximum number of pieces for any given number of cuts. Now, notice-- Thank you. --Cut number one yields two pieces. Right. Cut number two yields four pieces. Right. Do you detect any pattern yet, Dick? It looks as if each cut adds a number of pieces that is always equal to the number of the out. Bravo, Dick. I think you're beginning to get it. As long as each cut intersects the lines of the previous cut, that rule should hold true. Now, if we draw the next line in that manner and count the pieces, I'm sure you'll find they'll total seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven. Right again, Bruce. The Batphone, sir. Thank you, Alfred. Here, Aunt Harriet, see how many pieces you can get out of this. Oh, Alfred, I'm certainly glad I have you. Thank you, madam. Always happy to be of service. - Yes, commissioner? -A very serious situation has arisen, Batman. BRUCE". What, commissioner? Well, for once, I'm afraid it's of such vital importance and might have such far-reaching consequences I think we should not even discuss it over the Batphone. That bad, commissioner? That bad or worse. - Right away, commissioner. -No. No, Batman, wait. I don't even want us to meet in my office. Now, if you will go directly to the Gotham Plaza Hotel, I'll explain further. - Right. -Holy cryptology, what was that all about? I don't know, Dick. The commissioner is not given to unnecessary alarm. To the Batpoles. Chief. You're just in time, Caped Crusader. Right on the button. Saints be praised. Better three hours too soon than a minute late. Now, what's the crisis, commissioner? Uh Step into the Petit Ballroom. Happy anniversary to you Happy anniversary to you Happy anniversary, Dear Batman Happy anniversary to you Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, Batman and Robin as mayor of Gotham City, it is my privilege to officiate at this luncheon. One of many to commemorate a day cherished in the hearts of all Gothamites. A day when a man known only as Batman donned cape and cowl for the first time and appeared in our midst to preserve law and order. In appreciation of all the Caped Crusader has done for our community members of the Gotham City Dairymen's League have donated $200,000. Enough new bills, as a matter of fact, to fill a golden calf. The proceeds from this luncheon and others in your honor will be donated to your favorite charity, Batman. Ms. Anna Gram, Milkmaid of the Month will make the presentation. The calf, please. - Speech. Speech. -Right, speech. Speech! Thank you. Mayor Linseed, good citizens of Gotham City I can only state humbly that this is perhaps my finest moment. Citizens, stay calm. Make your way to the exits slowly. Batman, look, the window. The fire department is here already. That's what I call fast action. Almost too fast, Robin. Have you noticed the lack of flame in this room and that curious green smoke? Batman, the firemen are leaving with the golden calf. Not firemen, Robin. The thieves who staged this flameless inferno. Let's get them. - Riddler. -Salutations and consolations anniversary boy. -Riddler, that money is for charity. I'll see that it gets into needy hands. In the meantime, I suggest you look for an engaging page to herald the next of my anniversary surprises. Ta-ta. Holy trampoline. Where did Riddler get a Gotham City Fire Department rescue truck? Where he got it is not as important as where he's going. To the Batmobile. There's no need for axes. There was no fire. Merely a well-planned smoke screen to hide the Riddler's theft of the golden calf. That enigmatic egotist back to plague our fair city? But not for long. Holy fork in the road. Twin rescue trucks. One vehicle is set on an evil course, the other on an errand of mercy. We can't risk stopping the wrong one. Luck is no lady today, that's for sure. Luck generally comes to those who look for it, Robin. Riddler rarely leaves anything to chance. Paper, mister? Which paper is it? Gotham City Herald. Latest edition, 10 cents. Want one or a bundle? One, please. Thanks, pally. I know it's important to be well-informed, Batman but don't you think we should be finding Riddler? That's exactly what I'm doing. He suggested we look for an engaging page to herald the next of his anniversary surprises. - Right. -And what would you call the daily puzzle page of the Gotham City Herald? An engaging Page- - The clue must be somewhere in that puzzle. -Precisely, Robin. And since the Gotham City Herald also publishes a morning edition with this puzzle he would've had time to design his crime with this puzzle in mind. What are we waiting for? Let's solve that puzzle. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in his hideout in the soon-to-be-opened Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory the Prince of Puzzlers coaxes his cohorts in a chorus of praise. Tell me again, you cringing knaves am I not the king? You are the king, Riddler. King, king, king- Breathes there another mortal who has absconded with a $200,000 anniversary present from under the cowl of the Caped Crusader? No, Riddler, no one. And who else would be clever enough to turn in a false fire alarm? So the real rescue truck would run interference for my escape. Ha, ha! What a marvelous piece of riddling genius that was. But I've only started with the Caped Crusaders. I'm going to confound them with conundrums unnerve them with enigmas, perplex them with puzzles until they wish they were dead. And then what, Riddler? Then, my jigsaw jackanapes, then I'll grant their wish. All right, knaves, follow me. We have work to do. Get into these, quickly. Gee, I wish I were going with you, Riddler. Your part in our plan is critical, dear Anna Gram. Do it well, and you can help us strike our next blow. Where are we going, anyway? We are going to a banquet. This puzzle's given us a few minutes of mental exercise but it still has to provide us with a clue Riddler promised it would. Well, we've been studying this puzzle as a puzzle. I keep thinking about the way you worked out that pie puzzle this afternoon. You mean, inductively? Right. Across one, "a water utensil. " Answer, "basin. " Down one, "a formal dinner. " Answer, "banquet. " Down three, "a public way. " Answer, "street. " - Down four-- -Wait a minute, Robin. The Sons of Balboa are having a banquet at the Basin Street Hotel. And they filled a Spanish chest with $100,000 worth of gold doubloons to contribute to your favorite charity. A tempting treasure for that pirate Riddler. The Batphone. - What is it, commissioner? -An alarming incident in our financial district, Batman. A water main under Matron Lane has burst and flooded the underground vault of the Gotham City Bank. A flooded vault. Or a flooded bank. A bank wet, Batman. Commissioner, muster your forces at the Basin Street Hotel and guard against criminal activity at the banquet being given by the Sons of Balboa. - Robin and I will race to Gotham City Bank. -We'll be there in a trice. No doubt Riddler intended to divert us to the wrong banquet. While he and his vultures no doubt picked the vault clean at Gotham City Bank. But underwater? No doubt a wily ruse of some kind. We'll need our Batrespirators. To the Batmobile. NARRATOR". While the champions of justice race to the Gotham City Bank the Riddler and his frogmen are already at work in its watery vault room. Flooded per their wily ruse to keep from being followed. - Worked like a charm, Riddler. - Why not? There's a difference between a Batman and a frogman. One quick stop and then let's go dry our money. Another bulletin from Riddler? I'm afraid so, Robin. And look at this. Only Riddler and his ilk would have such a flagrant disregard for private property. This door will have to be repaired. Not to mention the fortune he's stolen from the vault. What does that giggling gorilla have to say this time? Another one of his canny conundrums. "When is a man drowned but still not wet?" NARRATOR". Back in the soon-to-be-opened Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory the Prince of Puzzlers tallies his ill-gotten gains. One million five hundred thousand. One million five hundred thousand and one. A million and a half bucks. I never thought I'd see that much loot at one time. Yeah, that's sure a lot of damp dust. It's only half of what we need. Well, it's plenty for us, Riddler. You shallow-brained simpletons, where's your imagination? Your ambition? Why do I have to keep reminding you? Three million dollars will buy us a weapon so awesome, so destructive, so terrifying the Gotham City fathers will get down on their miserable knees and offer me anything not to use it. The entire city will be mine, mine, mine! Well, I suppose Batman and Robin are just gonna fold up their capes and retire. Yeah, what about them, Riddler? Caped Crusaders will be wherever it is Caped Crusaders go when they're dead. That is if you two lackwits haven't bungled your assignment. - Well, we did just what you told us, Riddler. -Without a hitch. All right, all right. Professor Avery Evans Charm, a genius and my friend. An artful contrivance. I congratulate you. A mere toy compared to some of your devices, professor. Is your fundraising campaign going well, Mr. Riddler? See for yourself. Beautiful. I'll say. - One million five hundred thousand. -And one. I can't wait to put my Demolecularizer in your hands and watch the members of the Gotham City Science Institute quake at my handiwork. They still won't let you join, professor? I'm a high school dropout. So am I. Oh. When will you have the $3 million? You won't be waiting long, professor. Ere set of sun, all Batman's anniversary money will be in these two hands. And the masked man hunters just an unpleasant memory. NARRATOR". When is a man drowned but still not wet? Unaware of the ghastly fate that awaits them the Caped Crusaders struggle valiantly to solve the Riddler's latest conundrum. Nothing? Nothing. I'm beginning to think this riddle doesn't have an answer. You may be onto something, Robin. There is a tack we haven't tried yet. - Uh, begging your pardon, sir. -Yes, Alfred? Forgive me for interrupting your celebration, sir but, uh, I felt that I ought to remind you of your appointment at the bakery. - The bakery? -Yes, sir. I understand that the Gotham City Baker's Guild has prepared a rather unique cake in your honor and wishes you and Master Robin to, uh, pose for the sculptured, uh, marshmallow figures of yourselves which will top the confection. How could I have forgotten? Thank you, Alfred. My pleasure, sir. Let's go, Robin. We'll continue our attempts to fathom Riddler's cryptogram while posing. Right. Change of scenery may turn the trick. Now, that's what I call a cake. Yes, it is rather formidable, isn't it? Batman. Robin. Gee, it sure was decent of you fellas to come all the way down here to pose for your marshmallow statues. We're flattered we were asked. Oh, it was nothing. Now, you're probably in a rush to get to your Gotham Square Park appointment so I'll be just as fast as I can. Now, all you have to do is go up to the top of the cake and you stand in the center with your hands at your sides. It doesn't take long to carve marshmallows. That's the second appointment we've forgotten today, Robin the final ceremony at Gotham Square Park. In which the funds accumulated in our honor will be turned over to our favorite charity. Riddler's latest brain twister has us both dizzy. Breathe deeply. Perhaps a breath of fresh air will clear our minds. Here we go, Batman. We're sinking, Batman. Congratulations, Bat brain, you've risen to the occasion. Can't get my feet out of this. It's like quicksand. It is quicksand, Robin. Riddler's own prepared mix, cleverly disguised as strawberry icing. That's right, you sinking saps. Quicksand, 15 feet of it. Call it an anniversary present. That scurvy fiend. Sorry I can't stay around to see you descend into oblivion, pastry faces but I have an appointment to keep with some money at Gotham Square Park. Happy anniversary to you Happy anniversary to you Happy anniversary, dear Batman Ta-ta. Happy anniversary to you I did think it would all end differently, somehow less ignominiously. To drown in my own anniversary cake Drown? But in quicksand? Yes, old chum. Death in quicksand is technically drowning. That's it, Batman. - What, Robin? -The answer to the riddle. When is a man drowned but still not wet? We'll be drowned, but in quicksand so we won't get wet. Excellent. You've done it again. Mm-hm. Lot of good it'll do us now, though. 
NARRATOR". We have previously seen in a fancy new restaurant run by an old friend a gay dinner party interrupted by a shocking and senseless theft. Caught red-handed. Too red-handed. It could have been a plot. Better call Batman. Strange, he wants to be arrested. So let him go. Spy on him, find out his plans. Cold-blooded murder. A fake. Another attempt to get into the pen. What? A super-crook like him in a mere city jail? What's his scheme? Got it. He wanted to contact a forger who's doing time. But Penguin broke out of jail. Snatched Chief O'Hara as a hostage. Challenged the Dynamic Duo to a fair duel. A fair duel? With that crooked bird? O'Hara in a trunk. Deadly Penguin guns waiting. High-voltage electric cables into the pool. Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. In just one minute, the gunfire is going to blast. Look! That trunk on the slide. Push it. - Holy Davy Jones! -Hold it. This could be a deathtrap. - Fire! -Down! Bat Shield. Holy Guadalcanal, Batman. What now? Stay calm. Let's assess this desperate situation. Dollars to doughnuts, Chief O'Hara's in that trunk. And look! There's Penguin at that electric switch. Right. First thing drive the bird away with a Bat-pellet. Nice eye, Batman. No time for compliments, I'm afraid. Let's advance our Bat Shield through this deadly gunfire. - Make for those big electric cables. -Right you are. What do we do? Cut them with our Insulated Bat-clippers? On the contrary. I'll reverse the polarity with my special Bat-inverser. Oh! I'm blinded. Those dratted bat fellas. Watch it. Someone's getting back to that electric switch. Indeed. Just as I'd hoped. Get back. All right, fry, Chief O'Hara. You fry and sizzle and boil. Holy levitation. How did that happen? Simple. By reversing the polarity of the cables I transformed the swimming pool into a gigantic antimagnet. It repelled the metal of the trunk. Curses. We're out of ammunition! It's a trick to get us out from behind our Bat Shield. - No trick, Robin. They are out of ammunition. -How do you know? Easy. I've been counting their bullets. At them. Surrender, you criminals. - Up with your flippers! -Quack. Open the trunk. Release Chief O'Hara. Roger. - Are you all right? -Whew. Drat it! It's most irritating. A perfect plot gone awry. It'll happen to the criminal every time, Penguin. Get set for a short flight. - Next stop for you, the bar of justice. -Quack. Next case, bailiff. An arraignment, Your Honor. Mr. Penguin and his rascally restaurateurs. - On what charge? -Various, Your Honor. "Kidnapping of a police chief illegal electrification of a swimming pool littering public property with machine gun cartridges without proper license therefore attempted murder, mayhem, battery and compound assault. " Dear me, most serious. Where's Mr. Jefferson Hamfurter, the district attorney? With your permission, Judge Moot Mr. Hamfurter has asked me to represent the people. Of course. It will be an honor, Batman. Will the prisoner Penguin rise and state how he pleads? In the immortal phrase of Emile Zola: J 'accuse! What? You accuse? Indeed, Your Honor. I accuse Batman and Robin and the Gotham City Police Department with conspiracy to deprive me of my lawful rights. You got that? On what facts do you base your grave charge, Mr. Penguin? Well, early yesterday evening, Your Honor I was apprehended in the act of heisting a diamond bracelet from the wrist of one Mrs. Harriet Cooper. And although my guilt was manifest Batman and Robin prevented my arrest. Astonishing. What do you say, Batman? It's quite true, Your Honor. I felt in this peculiar situation-- He felt, he felt! Under what do we live in Gotham City, sir? We live under a code of law or do we live under a costumed madman's feelings? Point well taken, Mr. Penguin. Thank you, Your Honor. - Your Honor, I object to-- Objection overruled. Continue, Mr. Penguin. Thank you, sir. As a law-breaking citizen I had and I have a clear right of admission into the Gotham State Penitentiary. Quite so. Quite so. Now, deprived of those rights, I had no other recourse but to protect myself by any means at my disposal. Hmm. Mm. In other words, the acts of which you're accused were merely a citizen's reaction to illegal police conspiracy? Solomon himself could've put it in no neater nutshell, Your Honor. But, Your Honor, kidnapping, mayhem the attempted drowning of our beloved police chief. Holy flip-flop, what's happened to justice? You call attempted mayhem a "normal citizen's reaction"? Enough, Boy Wonder. I fear you're out of your depth in these thorny matters. Way, way out. Ahem. Now, our code of law is the cornerstone of our society. Whenever it is violated by those sworn to uphold it which you clearly did, Batman then what recourse has the humble citizen but action? Now, which of us is to cast the first stone? We've been outwitted, Robin. It's not fair. Let's fight. Another day, another way. Your Honor, the people withdraw their case. Very well. Dismiss the charges. Release Mr. Penguin and his rascally restaurateurs. Do you mean that you are not sending me to the state pen? No. Your eloquence has gained you freedom, Mr. Penguin. Now fly the straight and narrow path forevermore. Faugh. This is one plan Penguin won't twist. There. That ought to do it. Remarkable indeed, sir. You can say that again. I bet Batman's the only one in the world with a hand steady enough to paint false fingerprints. Come, come, Robin, don't exaggerate. All it takes is a little practice and a bit of patience. Fortunate the criminal classes don't realize the possibilities. It wouldn't help them if they did, Alfred. The poor wretches are addicted to tobacco and alcohol. They lack the nerve control for this sort of work. You know your role? I've committed it to memory by rote, sir. So proceed to The Penguin's Nest. Good luck. - It's a privilege to be of help, sir. Good day. - Ah, ah, ah. Don't touch anything for a minute and 23 seconds. Remember. Very good, sir. Yes. Robin, would you get me police headquarters via the special tip line, please? Roger. -It's ringing. -Good. Police headquarters. This is a friend speaking. There's trouble at Table 7. What now? Some nitwit complaining about a fly in his caviar? - Police trouble. -Police? What do you mean? That bonehead chief flatfoot. The one that we tried to bump off in the trunk. Better have a look. But, my dear chap Don't you "dear chap" me, Mr. Quill-Pen Quertch. -"Quill-Pen Quertch"? -Who's he? Heh-heh-heh. My pretty brainless birdie he's merely the most brilliant criminal penman who ever lived. What an astonishing stroke of luck. Get out of town, Quill-Pen. As St. Paddy said to the snakes in dear old Ireland, "Out. " I give you three hours. Or is it too neat to be a stroke of luck? You're right. It might be a trap. Chickadee, get the gentleman's fingerprints. Mr. Dee, come with me. Quack, quack. Ah, fingerprints. Famous Forgers, International. - Ah! Here we are. -His water glass, Pengy. Well done, my sweet. Mm-hm. Right index finger. Can you read me Quertch's classification in the file? "Twelve-R-seven-one-Q-six. " --seven-one-Q-six. Eureka! It's Quill-Pen, after all. Shh. Your host and colleague, Mr. Quertch. That brainy bird of prey, the Penguin. - I'm honored, Comrade Penguin. -Heh, heh. Oh, yeah, that's right. Now, uh, allow me to suggest a mutually profitable collaboration. By all means, old bird. What's the setup? You see, it happens that I have very cleverly got hold of-- - Curious. - Huh? Uh, I have a strange feeling that I have seen you somewhere before Mr. Quertch. -Heh. Well, perhaps my-- My phiz in the Rogue's Gallery, what? No, I don't think so. Great heavenly ice floes! Mercy me! Oh, the poor man has fainted. Ladies and gentlemen, friends of The Penguin's Nest I regret to announce the outbreak of a sudden epidemic: Moldavian food poisoning. I suggest, while you can run for your lives to your favorite family physician. - What's happened? -Who is he, Pengy? He's an impostor. I recognize him as a busybody who has stumbled into my stew before. His name is Alfred. He is the faithful butler of the millionaire Bruce Wayne. I don't like it. He should have checked in five minutes ago. Gosh, do you think Penguin's seen through our ploy? I don't know. But I may have made a grave mistake in sending Alfred to that devil's lair. Come on, Robin, quick! I don't get it. Why should Bruce Wayne's butler be wearing a set of phony fingerprints? Alas, it's too simple. See, Mr. Wayne is a very prominent bank director and they have got wind of my super-crooked forgery scheme and this is a counterplot laid by the Gotham City League of Bankers. - Yeah. Yeah, that figures. -So, what do we do? I am brainy. I am nimble. I am versatile. This Bruce Wayne will pay dearly for his clumsy interfer-- Mr. Blue. Mr. Blue. I want you to prepare We are going to make a gigantic butler pie. Heh! Sinister. This could be a crude attempt to throw us off. There's no one in the dining room. There may be someone in the kitchen. Let's find out. Alfred's bowler. Heavily dusted with pastry flour. Holy chocolate Ã©clair. What can it mean, Batman? I scarcely dare think. I fear it's too grim. Who are you? What's the meaning of this? It's a catered affair, madam. - In honor of Mr. Bruce Wayne. Is he home? -No. We'll wait. You get out of here. You get out of here at once. Shoo, you hideous creatures! Shoo! Answer it. Answer it. Hello? Hi there, Aunt Harriet. It's Dick. Bruce and I were just wondering if there's anything new around the house. Well, yes, I'd say there certainly is. Eh. Hello? This is Mr. P. N. Guin. - Penguin, you-- -Careful. You're Dick Grayson. You mean the Penguin? The famous criminal I've read so much about? That's who I mean, Dicky boy. And you better tell your guardian, Mr. Wayne, that if he wants to see Alfred alive he'd better hurry home fast. Quick. To the Batmobile. Ah, there you are, Mr. Wayne. Good day, Mr. Wayne. And good day, my boy. Welcome. Welcome, the both of you. Heh. - Why, what an extraordinary pastry. -The biggest I've ever seen. Yes, its name is Humble Pie, Mr. Wayne. - And you are about to eat it. -You don't say. Yes. Mr. Blue, prepare to light the burner. Now, inside that pie is Quill-Pen Quertch the famous British forger. - Why, you-- -Steady, Dick, I'll handle this. And he will be cooked before your very eyes millionaire Bruce Wayne, the banker's friend. Unless you compensate me to the tune of $1 million cash. Now. A million. I believe I have that sum on hand in the small wall safe in my study. Come on, I'll help you get it out. Turn off the Automatic Costume Change Device. Costume Device off. Quickly. Now, a small tricky charade to preserve our secret identities. - Take your cues from me. -Roger. Look, Dick. Good gravy, Dick, coming through that window. Why, Bruce, isn't that Batman and Robin, Bruce? It certainly is, Dick. Go on and get them, Batman and Robin. We'll just be out here so as not to be in your way. Nice. Curse it! We have you this time, Penguin. We planted a tiny homing device in your hat. We've been tracking you relentlessly. Up with your flippers. Surrender that gigantic pie. To the fray, my rascally restaurateurs! Stop, Batman! Stop or I blow the lady's brains out! Batman-- Oh! Well hit, madam. Quickly, down and up the Batpoles before they wake. - Ah. -Good gravy. That must've been quite a battle. Yes, indeed, sir. Too bad you missed it. Where are they, Alfred? I'd like to give them my thanks. They departed through the window, sir, in some haste. Oh, and, sir, they asked me to give you a message. Should you ever again come up against such a criminal as the Penguin don't endeavor to capture him yourselves. Call the police. - Quack. -The job of crime-fighting is theirs. Faugh! There you are. Only one. Quack. Triumph at last. We're being sent to the state pen. Rendezvous with Ballpoint Baxter in the next cell. - You still got the handwriting samples, Pengy? -Of course I do. In the handle of my tricky umbrella. Ha-ha-ha. - Oh. - Good morning, commissioner. - Oh, hello, Bruce. Has my man arrived? He should have been here by now. O'Hara went to get him. Oh. Here he is now. Ballpoint. Ballpoint Baxter? That's right, Mr. Penguin. I've just secured him a parole. Mr. Baxter's going to teach penmanship in one of the Wayne Foundation camps for underprivileged children. Oh, no. No. What about the underprivileged criminal? All right, you crooked birds, let's get moving. - Quack. - Come on. Ballpoint. Ballpoint. Ballpoint, don't leave me. All right, come on. The bus is ready to take you to the state pen. Come on, Mr. Baxter, an honest life awaits. One I'm sure you'll find very, very satisfying. 
NARRATOR". When last seen, the Dynamic Duo was trapped in a large vaporizing pipe in Mr. Freeze's frosty hideout beneath the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena. With his hand on the controls, Mr. Freeze was in the process of lowering their temperature and then vaporizing them into the Bruce Wayne Ice Rink above. Did he? Has he? Will he? In one chilling moment we'll find out. As soon as that tube is completely frost-covered which will mean that the Caped Crackpots are ready and chilling then I will activate this vaporizing pipe pump and Batman and Robin will be a permanent part of the ice rink upstairs! And it won't be long now. Gosh, Batman, I've heard of people freezing to death in places like Siberia, but not in the heart of Gotham City. Keep working on that reverse thermal Bat Lozenge I gave you, Robin, it might do some good. Will it keep me from vaporizing? I doubt it. What a ghastly way to go. How long will it take? Under the right conditions, and with the right temperature even solid matter, the human body can be vaporized in a split second. That's not very long. Batman, I feel like I'm evaporating right now! As far as Mr. Freeze is concerned, you are. Well, the tube is completely frost covered, so - Darling -This is no time to get cold feet, Glacia. The countdown's over, time for blast-off! Ah. They're gone. Of course they're gone. And all the frosting in the tube with them! One moment Masked Meddlers, the next moment Cold Crepes! Pumped like any other freezing mixture right into the ice rink upstairs! Speaking of ice, boss, what about their Professor lsaacson? Take him out of the Quick Freezer once again, Boys. Let's see if we're making headway in that department. Well, professor. I'm sure your native Iceland seldom has a temperature as low as that in my Quick Freezer. What's the temperature? - Two hundred degrees below zero. -Two hundred degrees below zero. I admit it was cool. You think you could remember a little more of your secret formula now? I don't know, I-- I think you've frozen my memory, as well as me. Well, then perhaps another injection of dry ice might help? Not that again, please, please, please. I'll-- I'll try. - I'll try. - All right, come on. They're double-crossers, all of them. Bruce Wayne, Batman, Robin. I wouldn't blame Mr. Wayne, darling, I'm sure he's a man of his word. - When I met him earlier tonight-- -You met him earlier? Where? He came backstage before the performance. - Alone? -No, he had Mrs. Harriet Cooper with him. A charming lady. If only she hadn't picked up my Picked up what, Glacia? Picked up what? My compact. So that's what was happening when all the time I thought this was broken! You know what you've done, don't you? I didn't do anything. I said it was a little music box. Some music box, it sang a song of underground hideouts beneath ice skating rinks. Bruce Wayne is no idiot, I'm sure he's worked out some clever scheme so that Batman and Robin can bring the professor back without paying any ransom. - Well, it didn't work. -No. But if Bruce Wayne knows where I am, so does the police. - And if the departed duo don't return-- -Well, I told you not to vaporize them. There's plenty of ice in the ice rink already. Yes, there's plenty, and far safer ice floating in Gotham Harbor! Frosty, Chillbrain! Take the professor back to the ice wagon. We are going in the ice sub to the hideout in Gotham Harbor. Where I'll demand a far greater ransom from the professor or else I'll destroy all of Gotham City! What about Asoulda? You know your seal, she's never come back. We'll just have to sacrifice Asoulda. Just another expendable seal. Take him. - Come on, Glacia. -But, darling what about the ice revue and my famous Waltzing arabesque? Glacia, take your choice. Your career or me. I have no choice, darling. NARRATOR". But what's this? Something stirring in the seal house when we know Asoulda's in a bathtub at Police Headquarters? The es-Caped Crusaders? It's a cold fact all right. Holy escape hatch. Yes, Robin, most refrigeration systems as large as this one in the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena have emergency exits. It's lucky you remembered the one behind that vaporizing tube when you did. You're seldom wrong, old chum, but a split second is longer than you realize. Long enough for Mr. Freeze so that he split too, I see. Not without taking Professor lsaacson with him and his frosty confederates and Emma Strunk. - You mean, Glacia Glaze? -No, Robin, Emma Strunk. No, you mean Glacia Glaze. No, Emma Strunk. Glacia Glaze is far too charming a pseudonym for one of her chilling corruption. - To the Bat Cave? -And up the Bat Poles. The Bat Poles? Even crime fighters need their sleep, Robin. While those crooks just stay away from us? Don't worry, Robin, Mr. Freeze will be frozen in his tracks before we're through with him. Let's go. But what's this? On the dawn of a new day not just one iceberg, but a sea of icebergs off Gotham City Harbor. - How we doing, boss? -Fine, boys. Our ice magnets have attracted every iceberg from the South Pole to the Arctic Circle. Now no one will be able to tell which is our iceberg. Now, professor, how are you doing? I'm done. Here's my secret formula. As nearly as I can remember it. How does this work? How does what work? - How does this formula work? -I don't know how it works. I worked out the formula, but I never did work out how it works. You Darling. Aren't you being a little rough on poor Professor lsaacson? Poor Professor lsaacson will become rich Professor lsaacson, Glacia. If we can put his secret formula to use for our own gains, we'll all be rich. The world will be yours, Glacia. - Mine. -Of course, don't you see the potential? The Kremlin will be a cold water flat in a second. The White House an icebox. We would control everything from cold cream to cold wars and all the lovely ice in the world will sparkle on your fingers and dangle from your ears. -You mean ice like in diamonds, darling? No, Glacia, I mean ice like in icing. That secret formula will be the frosting on the cake and the cake will be the universe. Well, then, professor Go, Glacia, go. Yes, Governor Stonefellow? Yes, Governor Stonefellow? Yes, Governor Stonefellow. - A little problem, commissioner? -A little problem? Ha! Everything that has happened before, Chief O'Hara everything that happened yesterday, last night. The near disaster to the Gotham Queen. The apparent kidnapping of Glacia Glaze. The astounding buildup of icebergs outside Gotham Harbor. Even the strange disappearance of the Caped Crusaders themselves. - Ha, ha. Insignificant, trivial, paltry. -It is? - Peanuts, popcorn, a pinch of snuff. -It is? Child's play, a brass farthing. Uh, it is, commissioner? Compared to the word just received from the nation's capital. The Chief Executive was just beginning an address to Congress. When he looked at his teleprompter what do you think he saw? - His speech. -No. In some diabolical way, perhaps a thermodynamic ice ray beam of some kind his speech on the teleprompter had become frozen. And in its place was a message from Mr. Freeze. Bless me suspender buttons. Saying that this city, this state, this country would be returned to the Ice Age in a matter of moments Unless we capitulated to all his demands, at once. Uh, well, what are his demands? Oh, that's just it, Chief O'Hara, he said to prepare ourselves for a little sample of what he had in mind. And then prepare to pay. Well, where did they think that this, uh thermodynamic ice gizmo was being beamed from? One of the hundreds of icebergs now lying off Gotham Harbor. Well, what about the Coast Guard, the-- The Ice Patrol? Understaffed, overworked. There must be some solution. The solution, as always, rests in hands other than ours, Chief O'Hara. Oh, Batman, wherefore art thou? Whereforever he are, commissioner, he heard you. Yes! Yes, Batman? I probably should have checked in earlier, commissioner, but we had a busy night. - Mr. Freeze escaped us. -I am aware of that, Batman. But we'll now use every means at our command and there are many, to track him down. Well, hurry, Batman, hurry, time now belongs to Mr. Freeze. It no longer belongs to us. But so does the Thermodynamic Ice Ray Beam constructed in his icy Noah's Ark under the direction of Professor lsaacson. You are a genius to have made this, professor. Out of the odds and ends in this iceberg. Genius, Miss Glaze, is the talent of a man who is dead. And the Ice Ray Beam isn't dead. Now to give Gotham City a small sample of how it works. NARRATOR". And how it works. Frozen assets, frozen pipes frozen waste. Even in the Bat Cave. Holy chill blades, look at the Batcomputer, Batman. I am, old chum, I am. Frozen to its very marrow. - But how, why? -No doubt, Mr. Freeze is up to another diabolical thermodynamic experiment-- At the risk of sending cold shivers down your back, sir Mrs. Cooper has just heard a most chilling morning broadcast. Say no more, Alfred. Yes, Batman? Arrange a broadcast to Mr. Freeze, commissioner. Tell him-- Tell him we await his demands whatever they are. In the meantime, is that seal still in the bathtub in Police Headquarters? Yeah, flipping merrily away. Good. Do you have the Seal Bat Signal I gave you? The small echoing seal pulsator? Uh, yes, Batman, it's right here. Excellent. Attach it to one of the seal's flippers. Then release the seal in Gotham Harbor. No doubt it will home for Mr. Freeze's iceberg and we'll pick up its wavelength in the Batcopter. Right, Batman. Picked up the seal's pulsator yet, Batman? We're still over land, Robin, and a seal is an aquatic marine mammal. Gosh, yes, Batman, I forgot. Anything now? I think I got a slight blip from the Seal Bat Signal. Asoulda seems to be heading through Gotham Narrows. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in his refrigerated refuge Mr. Freeze and his frosty flunkies work out Our demands. Can you think of anything else? The, the part I like, boss, is that complete guarantee of immunity. The part I like is all that ice like in diamonds. Fifty million dollars is not to be sneezed at. Though of course, I never catch cold. Aren't you skating on thin ice? How do you expect payment to be made? By Batman and Robin, of course. Frosty, you seem to forget, the Dynamic Duo are now defunct. Oh, that's right, part of an ice rink. I guess we can call them now, the Vaporized Vanquishers, eh? Eh, boss? That's not bad, Frosty. "Vaporized Vanquishers. " That's not bad. Now where's the seal, Batman? Heading to the iceberg in that floating mass ahead of us. Take a look. Holy polar ice sheet. We'll drop down but I don't think we can land on it. You'd better inflate the Bat Pontoons. Check the compass and advise Commissioner Gordon of our location. He and his men may have to come out by Coast Guard icebreaker. Ready, old chum? - You bet. - Here we go. What do you mean the Coast Guard doesn't have an icebreaker? We've never needed one, commissioner. With Gotham Harbor completely blocked by icebergs wouldn't you say we needed one now? Uh, I don't know where I could put my finger on one. Well, put your finger on one, I don't care where. What's that? My parker, commissioner. Here's yours. That's P-A-R-K-A, Chief O'Hara. It's a hooded Siberian and Alaskan outer garment. Well, I'm no hooded Siberian, but, how do I look? In this particular case it isn't appearance that counts, Chief O'Hara. And you needn't have put it on until you get aboard the icebreaker. If you go aboard the icebreaker. Just trying it on for size. Ahem, Bonnie, please call my daughter Barbara at college ask her to take a later plane. I wanna meet her of course, but I have some cool facts to face before I get to the airport. Uh, okay, Nanook, let's go. Hey, boss, look who's in here. Asoulda. Asoulda. I told you she was a homing seal. Homing? Homing? Darling, what's the matter? This could be some kind of trick. It is some kind of a trick. The Batcopter's landed just outside the iceberg. The Batcopter? Yes, Glacia, but please, don't ask questions which I can't answer. Frosty. Frosty, Chillbrain, activate the ice magnets. We'll pull that Batcopter right into the iceberg. Just the way we did the Gotham Queen. I doubt that, Mr. Freeze. Salvation. How did you keep from being vaporized? How did you land outside the iceberg and get on it without me seeing you? How did you find the entrance to the ice ladders? Oh, darling, stop spitting ice cubes. It was really quite simple, Mr. Freeze, thanks to ingenuity your homing seal, our Ice Batarangs and our Ice Bat Ropes. And our Reverse Thermal Bat Lozenges. So you see, Mr. Freeze, you're the one who's on ice. The gun. Ah-ah. Didn't you learn last night that your freeze gun has no effect on us? Not with our super-thermalized Bat Skivvies under our regular clothes. Icemen, to the attack. Put them on ice! Ice! Put them on ice. No, you fool, get back into the battle. Glacia, I'm getting out of here even though normal temperature may mean my death in spite of my collar. Maybe not your death, Mr. Freeze, but at least a good long cooling off period. In our local Siberia. Take him away, Officer Sherman. - Don't touch the dials. - Darling. - Her too, Batman? -I'm afraid so, commissioner. - Emma Strunk is as guilty as the rest of them. -Emma Strunk? I'm Glacia Glaze, Batman. To the world of the rich and renowned, such as millionaire Bruce Wayne you may be known as Glacia Glaze. But to the world of the crime fighter you're known as Emma Strunk. Batman, if ever you see Mr. Wayne and he asks about me and Mr. Freeze would you tell him something Rabelais once said? Rabelais, of course. "To each his own, as the woman said when she kissed her cow. " - All right, all right. -Well, Batman, you've done it again. I don't know how to begin to express Gotham City's thanks. In this case, Gotham City owes most of its thanks to a certain homing seal. - Gosh, yes. -Asoulda. In fact, she deserves more than thanks, she deserves a special reward. Where'd you get a live fish, Batman? A true crime fighter always carries everything he needs in his utility belt, Robin. Bruce, Christmas sure came early this year. Yes, it did, Dick, thanks to Aunt Harriet. I don't know how you constructed this playroom as a surprise without us knowing about it, Aunt Harriet. Or this slot car raceway. It's the coolest, Aunt Harriet. Well, Alfred was a big help. And speaking of cool, Dick, can you guess what I've named my car? - What? -Glacia Glaze. And I think it's the prettiest car on the raceway. That's a good reason, Aunt Harriet. I've named mine Emma Strunk. - Emma Strunk. -For purely personal reasons, Aunt Harriet. - What about you, Dick? -I think I'll call mine Asoulda. How Wagnerian, Dick. Romantic. Alfred, what did you name your car? Mine seems to have run into a bit of trouble, Madam. So, uh, I think I'll call it Mr. Freeze. Mercy alive, that terrible man. When I think of all the trouble he caused and the problems so many people have. Like you, Bruce, with your Wayne Foundation and you, Dick, with that essay on the glaciers. My, I'm just so glad that I thought of this playroom. And this slot car raceway. Yes, Aunt Harriet, at least for a little while we can forget our worries. Ah! And have some fun. 
NARRATOR". Thus far, we have seen King Tut and his tank full of lovelies. While his Tutling heists some amber beads. But why? A vitamin pill and a call for help. Even Batman is stumped. His one lead a lead pestle? An unholy operation to release sacred scarabs from their ancient tombs. Shock treatments to resurrect them. Shocking. The pestle leads to an apothecary shop but Tut escapes with his scarabs. All but one, that is. A breeding farm for the plague? No, even worse. Abu raubu simbu tu, a deadly potion to paralyze the will. A clever ploy of Batman's. Robin in the sphinx. And the Boy Wonder gives it away. A precarious perch for the Boy Wonder. And Batman to the rescue. But does Tut have the last word? Don't go away. The most horrendous is yet to happen. Farewell, my moldy sparrow. In the name of Anubis great jackal-headed patron of the super-criminal I commend you to your fate. Ha, ha, ha. Come, my loyal lieges, let's away. I love my crocodiles madly, but I dislike the sound of their chewing. Heh, heh, heh. And I'm sure the commissioner awaits his pill. Don't forget to feed the scarabs. - Hang on, Robin. -Batman. Hang on, old churn. I'll try something else. Don't lose heart, Robin. Here I come. It was my fault, Batman. Dropping the Bat-radio in the sphinx. I'll be more careful next time. Experience teaches slowly, Robin. And at the cost of many mistakes. You know how wives are, Chief O'Hara. It's our anniversary, and I promised I'd take her to lunch but leaving this office under the circumstances Think no more about it, commissioner. I'll be proud to take over for an hour or so. I consider it an honor that you've asked me. I hoped you'd say that. Miss Patrick, Chief O'Hara is in charge of this office until I return. Please, follow routine procedure. - Have a good time. - I will, now. - Your pill, Chief O'Hara. -I never take pills. -It's routine procedure. -Hm? BATMAN". Commissioner, thank heavens I've reached you in time. Oh, the commissioner has just stepped out, Batman. This is Chief O'Hara. I'm in charge here for the time being. Well, thank heavens I reached you, Chief O'Hara. There's treachery in that office. The commissioner's summer secretary, the one who's replacing Bonnie is King Tut's current queen of the Nile. - Begorra. -We'll be there within a half hour. But don't be persuaded to take one of the commissioner's vitamin capsules. Oh, don't you worry, Caped Crusader, I wouldn't even think of-- I already took one. Are me eyes playing me tricks? King Tut, here in this office. How did you get here? Didn't anybody see you? Yes, they saw me. But I spoke to that charming and cooperative secretary of yours and told her we wish to be alone for a little private chat. Unmitigated gall. On your knees, helot. You got the wrong helot. On your knees anyway! The devil you say, Tut. You'll not bend my will to yours. Batman, look. What's he doing out there? I suspect the worst, Robin. Chief O'Hara, take it easy. Hi. Hello, down there, me buckos. He's doing a dance out there on that itty-bitty ledge. Ha, ha! Yeah, I know. My every whim is his command. - Oh, Tut-tut, give another whim. This is boss. -Heh, heh, heh. I'm spoiling you rotten. I never could resist a pretty queen. - Chief O'Hara. -Huh? Sorry to disturb you. A little acrobatics. Use the pole. Oh, that's very good. Don't fall. Heh, heh, heh. Holy high wire. It's Batman and Robin. Eeh! He should be giving my crocodiles indigestion by this time. How do you suppose he got out of that locked tank room? Chief O'Hara ought to know better. It's unwise to condemn what we don't understand. He can't help himself now. But let's try to talk to him. Let's away again, my pet. - We have enough sport for one morning. -Without even seeing him? Batman, that is. Cleo, just what does Batman mean to you? Oh, I guess it's all that restoratory power in his body. Or Or whatever he said. Restoratory power in his body. Mm-hm. I'll give you restoratory power. Get in there! Her wheelbarrow Through the streets Wide and narrow Chief O'Hara, come in now. Come on in, chief. Easy, now. Chief O'Hara, it's time to come in now. - It is? -Come along. Easy, now. That's it. Take it easy. MY pets. My babies. My beautiful emerald black cherubims. They all must die. Yes, Your Kingship. But remember, it's for an evil cause. And also remember that they will yield at least 95,000 gallons of abu raubu simbu tu. Zowee! That's enough bug juice to clop everybody in Gotham City or my name ain't Amenophis Tewfik. If you say that again, I'm gonna slap you. But you're right. After scarabating the city water supply I'll make loyal subjects of them all. - You weren't born yesterday either, Tut-tut. -Heh, heh. I just hope we can get the stuff brewed before Batman finds us. Batman, that big ninny. I'll have him eating out of my hand. And that'll have him drinking out of it. And I'll use Chief O'Hara as the catalytic agent. Well, we'll have to use Commissioner Gordon. He's back. - Chief O'Hara's left. -That's even better. The time has come to execute my royal master plan. Royal lapidary, prepare the transfer of the sphinx while I pay the commissioner a brief call. Ha, ha, ha. I say the first order of business is to have Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara removed from office. I mean, we can't have police officials who are helpless pawns of a master criminal. Here we are, sir. Six glasses of buttermilk. Oh, thank you, Alfred. You can discount Chief O'Hara. Robin, I suspect he's the victim of happenstance. That still leaves Commissioner Gordon. Unfounded suspicions are often dangerous, old man. Maybe, but we'd better do something. Agreed. If we're to thwart Tut's evil scheme I suspect the answer is to be found in these dusty pages. If there is an answer. For every venom, there's an antidote, Robin. I've already discovered that the Nile Oasis Scarab became extinct Yes, commissioner. I'm very sorry to disturb you, but this is very important. Now, listen very carefully. This is what you have to do. Very well, commissioner. We'll be there right away. The sphinx has reappeared. He's in Jefferson Square Park and it's making predictions just as I predicted. Loyal subjects, I have returned. And now for my latest prediction. Your all-powerful, all-conquering, all-good, friendly pharaoh will reduce water rates give you more drinking fountains, and will positively stamp out Bat brutality. This is a promise. This is a plague. This is a recording. Oh, the Batman, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You heard? New slogan, same old Tut. But he's right about one thing. Our fair city could use more drinking fountains. I'm parched, aren't you? Oh. A quaint, old-fashioned refreshments cart. Ha, ha, ha. May I treat you to a lemonade? Thank you, commissioner. That sounds refreshing. - Boy Wonder? -No, thank you. Very well, son. Two, if you please. I hope you know what you're doing, Batman. He seems quite his old self. Fine. Thank you. Ah. Thank you, commissioner. To your health. Never been better. I'm top-hole and as eager as ever to fight the forces of evil. To that too. I'll get that. And may the first super-criminal to feel our righteous wrath be King Tut. I'll sign that one on the dotted line. It's for you, Batman. Excuse me, commissioner. Surely, surely, surely. It's King Tut, Batman. And he insists on talking to you right now. He does, does he? Well, I've got a message for him. Tut, this is Batman. Yes. Yes. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, my good and friendly pharaoh. Your every wish is my command. I hear and obey. What is it, Batman? What's the matter? Batman, what's wrong? I can't tell what it is, but I think something's happened to Batman. He may have fallen under the spell of King Tut. Can't you do something? Batman. Commissioner Gordon. Batman, we bring you greetings from His Kingship Tut. I hear and I obey. Batman. Never mind, Robin. Never mind. Making progress, royal apothecary? Tanks are almost full, Your Kingship. Good. As soon as my visitor arrives and pays me homage we'll conclude my royal master plan. -Ha, ha, ha. Hail, mighty Tut. Take heed, loyal subject and note well that what was prophesied has come to pass. Mine enemy kneels at mine feet. Here's another one, boss. On your knees, Bat-brat. Never! Get up, Batman. You see, ex-Boy Wonder? He now responds only to my command. Tut, you are the greatest. I had planned a command performance to prove that this cringing crusader is no longer cock of the walk but merely a court jester, a buffoon. But I see by the royal apothecary that the tanks are filled. I must be off about my affairs. - Tut-tut. -Yeah? Can I command a performance of my own while you're gone? I want a jester of my own. And you shall have one, my queen. After I have scarabated the water supply you can have your choice of anyone in Gotham City. Anyone who's left, that is. But these two are going to be fed to my crocodiles right now. No, no! Not Batman! Another outburst like that, Cleo and my crocodiles are going to have a three-course meal. Hm? He's filled his purpose. And anyway, my slithering lovelies missed their lunch. Tonight, they shall have a truly succulent feast. Ha, ha, ha. Take them away. I'm off to the waterworks. Your Kingship, Batman's come out of his spell. Correction, I never was under your spell, Tut. Oh, I drank your cursed lemonade but I took the precaution of coating my stomach with buttermilk. Gosh, Batman. A pure and simple stratagem to divine the super-evil crime you planned not only against your fellow man but against Mother Nature herself. Buttermilk. Ugh. A plague on you, Batman. - Tutlings, sic them. -Ah! Unh! Unh! Not now! Open that hose valve. Keep your hands off my abu raubu simbu tu! No. Not my life's work. My life's blood and that of my lovely scarabs. All for naught. For naught. You. You! You're the one. You're-- You're the nicest man I've ever met, Batman, and this humble servant kneels at your feet. His formula, it's working on him. Poor deluded man. He's walking a tightrope, Robin. Abu raubu simbu tu plays no favorites. Gotham City has narrowly averted a catastrophe of major proportions. Too bad that such a distinguished professor in his twin trauma should become his own Cavia porcellus. Ca via parcel/us? Guinea pig. I'm appalled, Batman, truly appalled to think that I could have betrayed my high office. And to have slipped you a polluted lemonade. Don't give it another thought, commissioner. That will be all, young gentlemen. Complete your assignments and hand them in tomorrow. Not again. I'm off to a faculty meeting. Oh, you're off, all right, but not to a faculty meeting. Your phony Egyptian friends await our royal presence at the local tombs. Well-- Ah! I'm a professor at Yale. You can't do-- The PTA shall hear of this. - Where am I? -Are you going to try him in court? I haven't decided yet. With your approval, I'd like to think it over. No choice is easy in a case like this. I agree completely, commissioner. The law of this city is in your hands. We just try to help a bit here and there, wherever we can. So brave, so dependable and so modest. Rare in men these days. Very rare. 
Batman We have already seen a quiet Gotham City Bank. A sneaky operation. Apprehended? Not quite A load of lead. Goodnight, sweet guard. A call to Batman. He's on his way. Hey, hey, hey! The brass was stumped. . but Batman wasn't. He'd plant a story. A pair of crooks and one's a doll. Batman sets the doll trap. And the doll was tempted. The trap looked tasty. But the doll turned the tables and snatched Aunt Harriet. Holy backfire! One hundred thousand dollars ransom or a hot tub for Aunt Harriet. . in exactly one hour. Sizzled or saved? But wait, the worst is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na Batman Where can he be? Where can Bruce Wayne be? I keep telling you, commissioner, stop worrying. Batman will find him. Twenty minutes gone. Forty minutes remaining for Bruce Wayne to appear and contact the criminal or else. . Oh, that poor, unfortunate Mrs. Cooper. It always the poor ones who get the worst of these games. Any luck, Chief O'Hara? Well, thank you. Thank you just the same. Yeah, goodbye. Well, that's the last of them. I've called every rich man's club and eatin' place in Gotham City. He's in none of them. These millionaires! It's hard for us to comprehend the sort of lives they lead. Yeah, it's true, commissioner. I'll bet Mr. Wayne is out on some yacht. Eatin' sherbet and changing his clothes. Now, that's not true. Why do you jump at me so, Boy Wonder? Gosh, chief, I'm sorry. It's just that-- There, Boy Wonder, we understand. The lad's under great strain, Chief O'Hara. No doubt he can't help imagine himself in the position of young Dick Grayson, the nephew of the kidnap victim. Right lad? Uh, so right, commissioner. Well, console yourself, my boy. We haven't been able to locate young Dick Grayson either. He's fortunately ignorant of this whole tragic situation. Twenty five minutes. Why the devil can't Batman find Bruce Wayne? Am I in time? Thank heavens, Mr. Wayne. I hope so. Our little team. Chief O'Hara. - My pleasure, sir. - And Robin, The Boy Wonder. I'm sure glad Batman found you, Mr. Wayne. Me too, Robin. He located me on the outskirts of my estate. - He asked me to give a message. - Yes? Batman said, "Tell Robin to carry on. " He himself had to dash in search of a clue. - What was it? - He didn't stop to say. What's the situation here? Tight, Mr. Wayne. Ugly, I'll explain on the way. - The way? - Chief, alert my driver. Yes, sir. The criminal has asked to make contact in a strange but clever manner. Over television, Mr. Wayne. I have every Gotham City channel waiting on standby. Let's go. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the interruption of our regularly scheduled programs. This is a special announcement from Commissioner Gordon's office. Switch it, Jewel. Studio nine. You're on the air, commissioner. Hello, criminals. Wherever you are out there. Do you hear me, criminals? This is Police Commissioner Gordon. I'm Bruce Wayne. And I'm Robin, Batman's aid. I speak for him officially. Our phone number is 'I give you my word of honor this line is not being traced. ' That's right. No trace. Our only interest is the safe return of Mrs. Harriet Cooper. 'We give crooks no quarter' 'but we always deal with them fairly too. ' Ah, correct. Criminals, we don't wish to undermine what little remaining faith you might have in organized society. Yes. This line better not be traced, my friends. . or it'll be very sad for Mrs. Harriet Cooper. How is she? Oh, well, quite well, Boy Wonder. At least as well as one can be in a straitjacket over a fatal pool of flaming oil. You devil! How could a woman stoop to such a trick? Talk of tricks. What about that phony Star of Samarkand this morning? It was a fair weapon in a fight against crime. You know that as well as I do. Enough of this prattle. Mr. Wayne, listen to my instructions about the ransom. Wait. What? Are you trying to give me orders? Wait, the Boy Wonder is about to make a dramatic confession. That story in the paper about the bank money being counterfeit 'it was false. ' What? It was a ruse. It was a Batman's trick to make you try again. That money you stole last night is real. A statement from the editor of the Gotham City Times "This morning's headline. . was entirely untrue. " Look. 'It's signed and notarized. ' 'Let me add my assurance. ' As the director of the first national bank of Gotham City. let me tell you that the money in your possession is 100% bonafide. You gotta believe Mr. Wayne. As bank director, if he made a false statement he would be liable to federal prosecution. - Yes. - Don't you see out there? This reckless crime of yours isn't necessary. You already have your filthy lucre. For your own sake, release Mrs. Cooper immediately. Oh, Come on, you crook. You can't be all bad. Let the poor lady go, huh? Yes. Thank you. I believe you. It was only desperation that drove me to this. You-you'll release your victim? At once, with pleasure. Where? Don't worry. You'll find her. Goodbye. Goodbye. Ah, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. And now, we return you to our regular scheduled program in progress. - Holy hallelujah! We did it. - Thanks to you, Robin. It was your warm appeal that turned the tide. I'll call Chief O'Hara. I'll put the entire force on the alert. Get me Chief O'Hara. Chief O'Hara, yes, thank you. Are you alright? Could I help you, madam? I'm Mrs. Harriet Cooper. The kidnap victim? Yes. Would someone please call a policeman. My relatives must be terribly worried. Yes, ma'am. Scarcely minutes later back at stately Wayne Manor. . Is she alright, doctor? An amazing woman, Mr. Wayne. It was a real fight to make her accept sedation. 'Well, that's Aunt Harriet all over. ' You're sure she had no clues to divulge about the crooks? Not one alas. It seems that the minute she was lured into the taxi she was subjected to a potent but harmless drug. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go. Yes, of course. Thank you, doctor. I suppose you'll be wanting to find Batman now? That's right, Mr. Wayne. I will. What's the matter, Alfred? Excuse me, sir, but I can't help feeling that this whole somber episode is my fault. Your fault? Indeed, sir. Had I not been down dusting the Bat-cave when that false phone call arrived. . Good heavens! Perish the thought, Alfred. You were performing your proper duty. Begging you pardon, sir. Not true. Ordinarily, I tend to the Bat-cave on Wednesday evenings. I fail to do so because of my addiction to a certain television program. Listen, Alfred, rid yourself of guilt. That's right, Alfred. Aunt Harriet's fine now. She's more than fine. If it hadn't been for her mishap I wouldn't have deduced the criminal's identity. What? You know? Dear me. And I thought, uh, I thought I discovered the decisive clue. This, uh, book of matches, sir. The Gnome Book Store. Where did you find this, Alfred? 'Just now, sir. ' On the staircase. They must've fallen out of Mrs. Cooper's pocket when we helped her upstairs. I had hoped that they might indicate the whereabouts of the felon's lair. Nice thinking, Alfred. Darn nice thinking. To the Bat-poles. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Gosh, Batman, I'm stumped. Who the heck is the crook? Think over the clues. A female magician. So what use is that? Like we found in the files there are 27 female magicians licensed to practice in Gotham City. Think harder. Remember what she told us about Aunt Harriet's plight. Suspended in a straitjacket over a. . Holy birthday cake! Right. My last birthday, you took me to see her. We even met her backstage. Zelda the great! Sure, I remember. That straitjacket escape was her big gimmick. As usual, vain boasting has been this criminal's undoing. Gosh, though. Where does this Gnome book store come in? Where indeed. For back behind the phony book store Eivol is ready with his inescapable Doom-Trap. Well, well. Legal tender after all. Isn't life surprising, hmm? You have your money, Eivol. Now, tell me the secret. How do I escape from the Doom-Trap? You mean you haven't guessed, Zelda? Even after the hint I gave you? - There is no way to escape. - True. Even I, Eivol Ekdal, with all my twisted Albanian genius. Even I cannot devise the answer. That is where Batman comes in. Oh, we lure him into the trap? Then he show us the way out? Exactly. We use him as our pawn. Well, you mad Albanian. Even if Batman does work out the trick how can I use it on stage when Batman knows. We have an obscure peasant saying in my country "Dead men tell no tales. " Dead men? But of course, dear Zelda. After Batman escapes from the Doom-Trap he walks into instant liquidation. Wait, I show you. Ah. . gentlemen, welcome, gentlemen. All set up for the rub out? Yes, yes. Show me the money. One hundred grand. - Don't bother to count. - It might make us mad. It's like fringe benefit. Another $100,000 I get for. . What is the word? fingering Batman. I sign a contract with the syndicate. Kidnapping, murder. Where will it end? - You know I abhor violence. - You wretched weakling! You should've thought of that before you rob your first bank. Now, stop the stupid questions and think of a way to lure Batman into our trap. Done. What done? As I told you, Eivol, I'd guessed your scheme. I cleverly left a clue. I stuck a book of your matches in Mrs. Copper's pocket. No doubt he's on his way already. Not a moment to lose. Gentlemen, into the sarcophagi. Quickly. You see? They have peep holes. What's the shooting schedule? The instant Batman escapes from the Doom-Trap, shoot! Why not shoot him before he gets in? Because we need Batman to show us how to escape from the Doom-Trap, you fools! Gentlemen, dear friends. Remember, contract calls for bumping Batman after he escapes. It's in writing. Okay, if it's in writin'. Okay. Please gentlemen. There it is. Closed. Back in one hour. Could be a deception. Right you are. It's not even locked. Electric eye. Someone's coming into the shop. Quickly, Zelda, quickly. Where? Into my secret control booth. In the wings. Quickly. You may look in this periscope. Look, Batman, a note on the counter. "To whom it may concern. "Try interesting volume on top shelf last book of back row. " Gosh! Could it concern us? It certainly could. Look at that title. The truth aboutbats. Wow! That book worked a concealed switch. Let's see how the plot goes, huh? Bizarre! A play without actors. This script could be for us. One way to find out. Let's get in the limelight. Look, in this booth. It's a bat. I bet it means something. Holy fish bowl! We're shut in. Got them. A trick magnetic padlock. Oh, it seems such a waste. They're such handsome creatures. Shut up. Eivol, Eivol, can I help being a woman. Shut up I said. Now, I turn on the secret speakers hidden in the Doom-Trap. 'Gosh, Batman! What kinda trap is this?' It is a Doom-Trap, Boy Wonder. 'Welcome to my greatest achievement. ' 'The inescapable Doom-Trap. ' Poor, twisted mind. 'You stupid fools! I am a genius. ' Yeah, that's what they all say. Pipe down, Robin. We have to humor him. What's the big idea, genius? Very simple, Batman. Try to escape. Let's just do that. Our utility belts. 'Useless!' My jet age plastics are impervious to your tools. Eivol, what if even Batman cannot escape the trap? That will be very sad. Then I would have to give back your money. Or I could go back to the drawing board. Gosh, I'm afraid it's true. This stuff is tough. You are wasting time and you have so little left. Now. . look down at your feet. A deadly, colored gas is issuing. Quick, let's get that grill. 'Ow!' 'Electrified. ' Holy graveyard, Batman. 'This could becurtains. ' 'Don't quit, Robin. Let's get our heads down. ' 'This gas is rising. ' 'Lighter than air. ' 'We'll have a few more life-saving seconds. ' Oh, what a noble struggle! 'Hey, a gas lighter than air?' Must haveh-h-hydrogen in it. I-if we could electrify it. We can. High voltage grill. Metal buckles of our belts. Give me your utility belt and step back, Robin. 'Alright. Here goes. ' Sensational! He has done it. Batman, watch out. Those mummies! 'Aah. . ' 'Look, Batman. ' Holy crossfire! Poised on their own murderous petards. A couple of mummies. Let's taketh them to the morgue. But where's Zelda. Look at her. Glycerin tears. No, Robin. Real. Some other lifetimeBatman. Perhaps. Some other lifetime. Some time later at Gotham State Penitentiary female division. . Hello, Zelda. Hello, Mr. Wayne. I'll come right to the point, Zelda. While I can't pretend that your conduct has earned you any medals on the other hand, you did save Batman's life and The Boy Wonder's too. It was the least I could do, Mr. Wayne. True, true. But not many criminals would see it that way. I think you've earned a new chance. A new chance? The Wayne foundation of which I'm the head maintains a number of children's hospitals. Now, here's my offer. When you get out of here I'll see you get a position in one of those hospitals as resident lady magician. Oh, how wonderful. What a joy to entertain small children. I'm glad you feel that way. Consider it settled then. - Goodbye. - Wait please. Good heavens. If you ever see him give this to Batman. Please? Will you, Mr. Wayne? Next week, Batman vs the Joker.

Batman So far we have seen a jeweled crown. An inflating cape. A crown proved false. A cry for aid. And a ready answer. While False Face plotted. . a robbery. . no an ambush. Which backfired. False Face in chief's clothing captured the chief. Deduction by the duo. A daring escape by Blaze. Later nabbed by the Caped Crusader. Interrogation and repentance. . and embrace. Holy entanglement! A gasser. An escaping pair. The Dynamic Duo on the wrong track. Facing a fearsome fate. Wait! The wildest is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na Batman In the Bat-cave, deep under Wayne Manor a faithful Alfred tends to his daily duties. 'And now the cultural hour brings you a special message. ' 'Uh, to the friends of Batman' 'Many are called, but two are chosen, be receptive. ' 'Now, we return to the fragile intricacies of Mozart. ' Hold on, old chum, I've got an idea. Batman. Calling Batman and Robin. 'This is the Bat-cave, calling Batman. ' 'Calling Batman. ' It's Alfred, I've turned on the Bat-radio. Alfred, Batman here. Oh, very good, sir. I was concerned. Alfred, pull the short circuit lever on the Bat-transmitter. Short circuit lever? But, sir, that will destroy your wrist Bat-radio. Alfred, our relationship has always been one of mutual respect. I cannot disregard my own standards and order you to destroy the Bat-transmitter. But I am urging you to comply. If you put it that way, sir. Wasn't that Batman and Robin? Ah, yes. Fighting crime where ever it maybe. Good for them. Escaped the tricky twosome tore free, thanks to you. Why accuse me, FF? Batman's a redoubtably fine crime fighter. Fine, huh? Perhaps, you find him attractive, intriguing. . Was that it? I, False Face, I was merely according Batman the respect due an outstanding adversary. I haven't the slightest-- Not so much protesting, Blaze, and I'd believe you sooner. I say, do the deep-six with her. Not so fast. I make the moves in this mob. Yes, sir. I'll decide about you in the morning, Blaze. Meanwhile, I warn you. One thing I will not allow is anyone being false to me. Say, the radio message said "Many are called but two are chosen?" Yes, sir. Clearly a reference to yourself and Master Robin. I therefore activated the Bat-alarm and called you on the Bat-transmitter. Luckily for us. But gosh! Why'd False Face trap us then send a warning? Why? He wouldn't. But who would? The question is, Robin, not only why, but who. Very neatly done, Alfred. Thank you. Who sent that message? Who? O'Hara, where have you been? On a garbage scow, commissioner. It's alright. In a sack, I was wrapped up and abandoned. - That's criminal. - That it is, sir. And that's why I'm concerned about Batman and Robin. - The Caped Crusaders? - Yes. Or I was put into this condition byFalse Face. Today, all Gotham City is pulsating with one question. "What criminal outrage will False Face perpetrate next?" Meanwhile, Police Chief O'Hara shaken by his ordeal as the prisoner of the masked master of criminal concealment has sworn revenge. Chief O'Hara will broadcast an appeal to the citizenry of Gotham City later tonight. Of course. - What is it, Batman? - Broadcast. We'll trace that mysterious radio message back to it's broadcasting source. - Holy transistors! - Let's go. 'Who ordered that announcement?' 'A complete stranger. Anonymous. ' 'Frankly, Batman, I assumed that it was' 'simply another announcement. ' If someone wishes a message broadcast like "Many are called, two are chosen" I assume it's religious and that's all. I don't think we should treat religion lightly, Mr. Gore. Oh, of course not. I merely meant I treated it as part of the day's work. Then it's another dead end. Thanks to False Face. Is that who's involved? False Face? The criminal master of disguise? None other. That's why we hoped you'd give us a clue. I'm sorry that. . I say, there was one little thing that you might call peculiar. What is it? The young lady who paid for the announcement she was not only staggeringly beautiful she had green hair. Green hair! - Holy wigs! - Blaze. 'Does that mean anything to you?' Indeed it does. Good observation, Gore. Darn good observation. Then perhaps you can tell me what she meant by a parting remark. As she handed me the check in payment she said "I could bank on its being false. " Check bank false. What bank was that check drawn on? 'Gotham National. ' Of course. That's the bank the False Face is planning to break. - You mean the check is no good? - Not as a check, Mr. Gore. But as a message. Yes. Send the check to Commissioner Gordon. I'll see that you're paid. Blaze ordered the radio announcement? - And saved our lives. - She did even more than that. At great risk, she gave us the clues to False Face's next move. How so, Batman? When she handed the man a check in payment for the announcement she said, he could bank on it being false. Sounds rather cryptic to me. The check was drawn in the Gotham City National Bank. It baffles me, Batman if False Face contemplates a counterfeiting coup why he'd break into a bank? For a double dose of diabolical deception. Think, what's in a bank? - Money? - Right. And what is False Face been forging? - Money, counterfeit money. - Right again. And think of the consequences if False Face would place the bank's good money with counterfeit currency. Ghastly! It's gambling for billions. Gosh, nobody's money would be worth anything. Except False Face's. And nobody would be able to tell true from false. He must be stopped. No, he must be encouraged, enticed and only then. . entrapped. But how? By falsehood. Falsehood? Is batman capable of out-falsing False Face? Perfect. No one suspected you were hiding in here all day. Now the bank is closed and we're ready to begin our attack, right? 'Right, FF. ' Brinks, the bars. Very good, Brinks. Benz, Careful now, there's a very cunning electric eye set just 18 inches above the floor. - Go! - Right, FF. Electric eye alarm, eliminated. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Pinkerton, the TNT time talking. . Yes, FF. Back, back! - We did it, FF. - We're rich! Beyond the dreams of avarice. Not my dreams of avarice. Quickly now, loot sacks out. Now, let me at that lock. Is it clean? I'll dust it, FF. He's so fastidious. What? Is it possible? Not only possible but true. Please, not that word. We've turned your own tricky tables on you, False Face. Via a false vault. I'm never out-tricked until the last turn, Boy Wonder. Chief O'Hara, tell your men to search all these cubicles. - Careful! - Ow! - I'll handle him, chief. - Good man. He's been gassed. By that counterfeit policeman False Face. After him, Robin! The dogged duo is in hot pursuit. And they'll catch you, False Face. 'I hope so. I sincerely hope so. ' Because, you little fool I'm leading them into a truly torturous trap. What is False Face's fiendish foolery? Are the Caped Crusaders heading into a cul-de-sac? Will this be the dead end for the dedicated deeds of Batman and Robin? The old Bioscope Studios has been abandoned for years. False Face must have his hideout here in the crumbling sets and faded false front. We'll expose his concealments to the light of day and put him behind real bars. Good. They're hot on my trail. And very soon, they maybe even hotter. As a matter of fact, perhaps too hot. Oh, you monster! Holy rats in a trap! False Face is getting away. No, Robin, he seems to be coming back this way. What's he up to? Let's find out. Commissioner, dispatch a patrol car immediately to the Bioscope Studios to pick up a couple of thugs that Robin and I netted. And we expect to add False Face himself to the collection shortly. False Face may still have a plot or two in his bag of fiendish tricks. It's time for a little trickery of our own, Robin. They're coming right at me. Aah! I've done it. I've done it! I destroyed the Dynamic Duo. You diabolical demon! Ah-ha! Well, your clever Caped Crusaders are now kaput. Brilliantly done, Batman. But I blew up the Batmobile. I saw it go. Not exactly, False Face. You destroyed a false Batmobile. And inflated duplicate that I prepared for just this kind of situation. Face it, False Face. You've been out-decoyed. You fell for a phony target. Now, will you come quietly? Not yet, Dynamic Duo. Wait, it's faster on foot. Get me outta here. Stay here, Robin. Howdy, partner. What's all the ruckus? 'There's a criminal loose. ' Rustlers, huh? Well, I'll join the posse myself. I'll head 'em off at the pass. Intercepted, False Face. Commissioner. Are you alright? Yeah, chief. But the trickster got away from me. - Vanished that way. - Let's get after him. Yes, I'll send reinforcement. Chief, I must get back to my office. - Order me a squad car. - That's not necessary. False Face must be found before he springs another sinister scheme. Absolutely accurate False Face. But, Caped Crusader, that's the commissioner. Is it? Then why is a right-handed commissioner holding his handkerchief in his left hand. Saints alive. It's False Face. So you finally fumbled, False Face. For the moment. I lost him. Luckily, commissioner, he found us. Impersonating a police commissioner. Well, the warden will be workin' out a warm welcome for you. Game and set to you, Cape Crusader. But wait, you may yet meet your match. Come, come, now. Let's not be late. You know how sensitive a criminal can be the first day of parole. - But which criminal? - And why here? Because the Bruce Wayne rehabilitation fund arranged for it all. And I must say I think this one magnificent success justifies the entire risk. Just think, a hardened criminal completely reformed. 'You may come in now. ' - Penguin? - Joker? Blaze. Good morning, Mr. Wayne. Mr. Grayson. I wanna thank you personally, Mr. Wayne. Because of your rehabilitation fund I feel like a new girl. The pleasure is truly mine. What are your plans now, miss? I plan to go to New Zealand to keep house for my poor, but honest brother. He's a sheep herder. An entire new life. I think that's simply fine. And you are one of the two men who've made this possible. Two men? Who was the other one? Batman. 'The scourge of crime?' Cape crusader himself. I hope when I've paid my debt to society that I can in some way, somehow repay Batman. I would think that somehow he knows of your redemption. And somewhere he's glad.

NARRATOR". Midnight in Gotham City, the very dead of night. The Green Hornet and Kato outside the Pink Chip Stamp Factory? Something must be very much amiss inside the Pink Chip Stamp Factory for them to invade Batman's territory. A long way from home, indeed. And for a peephole to snap shut in their faces at midnight. We have visitors, boss. What? In the middle of my midnight snack? - I've just warned up this alphabet soup. -Masked visitors. Batman and Robin? Not Batman and Robin. Who are you? What do you want? - If you're interested in trading stamps -We might be. then visit one of our retail outlets in the morning. This is the factory. That sign on the outer door, "This means you," means you. Throw them out. - Why leave? We had them reeling. -We saw enough, Kato. I think at last we've found what we've been looking for. Tomorrow night we'll wrap everything up. NARRATOR". Then, in the rosy-fingered morn Who were your two visitors last night, Colonel Gumm? Just a couple of hoods, Miss Pinkston. I chased them away. Hoods, Colonel Gumm? In fancy clothes and a big black limousine? I saw them arrive through my apartment window. But, of course, it was too late to come down. Commissioner Gordon, please. This is Pinky Pinkston calling. No, Miss Pinkston. Colonel Gumm doesn't seem to understand that I own this factory, Apricot. He may be the foreman, but I am the boss. Let the police handle the masked intruders, Colonel Gumm. You have enough to do printing Pink Chip stamps. Hello, Miss Pinkston. What can I do for you? Two strange men invaded my factory last night, commissioner. My foreman threw them out but I'm running a legitimate business here and I may need your help. Well, of course. Can you describe the interlopers? What? What? NARRATOR". While from a pink factory with a green intruder we go to brick-colored Stately Wayne Manor and a red Batphone. This new stamp you've added to your collection is beautiful, Bruce. Supposedly, it's a very rare issue. The famous Blue Boar of Russian Samara. But I have my doubts about the watermark. Watermark? - Yes, this one's barely visible. -Ahem. - Yes, Alfred? -The red phone, sir. Dick, perhaps we can give Blue Boar a closer examination under the microscope in the study. Oh, Bruce don't forget you have a luncheon date with that sweet Miss Pinkston. Yes, Aunt Harriet. Hello? Britt Reid? Yes, Mrs. Cooper. I'm in Gotham City for the newspaper-publisher's convention. Wanted to say hello to you and speak to Bruce. Just a moment, Mr. Reid. - Alfred -Oh, yes, madam. - Yes, commissioner? -We have strong reason to believe that arch-criminal, the Green Hornet, is operating in Gotham City. - We'll run wide open. To the Bat-- -Sorry to interrupt you at a moment like this. But Mr. Britt Reid is on the other telephone. He's in town and would like-- Find out where he's staying and tell him I'll call him later. To the Batpoles. NARRATOR". But while the Dynamic Duo head for Commissioner Gordon's office in double quick time Britt Reid's making a little time of his own, or trying to. What do you mean you have a luncheon date with Bruce Wayne? It's the only free time I have during the publisher's convention. Well, I do, Britt. And I can't break it. Why don't you join us, Britt? After all, Bruce is a friend of yours too. Mm-hm. Not where you're concerned, Pinky. I thrive on rivalry. So don't be stubborn. The Camellia Room, 12:30? All right. You'll know me. I'll be the one dressed as a green-eyed monster. - Guess you can't win them all, Mr. Reid. -Hm. Ever since Bruce Wayne and I were kids we've been rivals in one way or another. The newspapers, the radio, TV, Mayor Linseed, Governor Stonefellow, all on my back because the rumor is out the Green Hornet is in our fair city for a piece of the action. A piece of the action at the Pink Chip Stamps Factory. That seems strange. With this heinous reputation for high stakes a out of a trading-stamps factory would seem like somewhat of a comedown. Maybe he was looking for something else at the Pink Chip Stamp Factory, Batman. The Gotham Gothic? Miss Pinkston's father, Pincus Pinkston May he rest in peace. was one of Gotham City's foremost stamp collectors. And the most valuable stamp in his collection was the famous Gotham Gothic. Sure. Worth a fortune. But it disappeared mysteriously shortly after he died. Yes, Bonnie? Oh, send him in, Bonnie. An important out-of-town newspaper publisher who I'm sure would be honored to meet you, Batman. Ah, Mr. Reid. - Commissioner. -Come in. - Good to see you. -Good to see you. And luck would have it, our famed Caped Crusaders, Batman and Robin. - Batman. -Welcome, Mr. Reid. - Thank you. Robin. -How do you do? - Sit down. Make yourself at home. -Thank you, commissioner. We have a mutual friend, Batman. Millionaire Bruce Wayne. In fact, I'm having lunch with him today. Oh? Give him my regards. We were just discussing a criminal, Mr. Reid, with whom you are no doubt familiar. The Green Hornet, from your own bailiwick. Just between us boys, Mr. Reid we have reason to suspect he'll be pulling some shenanigans in our own bailiwick. The Green Hornet? In Gotham City? Well, that shouldn't disturb you, Batman. Your name is legend among crime fighters. Legends are sometimes highly overrated, Mr. Reid. 'Twill be the Green Hornet who's overrated, Batman if he tries to tangle with you and Robin. For which we must prepare ourselves. - Excuse us, Mr. Reid. -Of course. We must get back to the Batcave. Sure, Batman. Maybe the Batcomputer can tell us a little more about our pea-green adversary. I'm very disappointed in these, Reprint. For someone who's advanced from manufacturing Pink Chip stamps to the fine art of counterfeiting priceless rare stamps your work has become very slipshod. Here, look at this overprint. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Fuzzy. Any expert could spot that. - So I goofed. -Which we cannot afford, Reprint. We have a lot to do in a very short time. - How short, Colonel Gumm? -Tonight and tomorrow, Cancelled. Then we move everything into the warehouse. Tomorrow night is the great International Stamps Exhibition where I plan to make my big kill. You sure ought to win some of the prizes. Winning prizes is not what I'm after, Block. It's walking away with some of the rarest and most irreplaceable stamps in the world. Whoops, oops! There comes the pink prima donna. Down her private stairway. Look busy and honest. Colonel Gumm. - Have you heard the latest news broadcast? -No, Miss Pinkston. I've been too busy. Oh, isn't that a shame, Apricot? Colonel Gumm has been too busy manufacturing Pink Chip stamps to know that this morning's intruders may have been the Green Hornet and his masked accomplice. Uh, what would they be doing in Gotham City? What would they be doing in my factory, Apricot? I will be lunching in town, Colonel Gumm. I wish she'd stop talking to that pink mutt and talk to me. - I think she was talking to you, boss. -Well, I'll soon find out. How, colonel? As you boys grow older and more experienced you'll find there's more than one way to skin a pink cat. Fine time for the Batcomputer to let us down. It's not the machine's fault, old chum. We overlooked one thing when we constructed it. A dual-identity Bat-sensor. Holy oversight. So we can't really blame our faithful friend here for failing to provide us with the clues we need about the Green Hornet. No human mind has solved the secret of our own duplicity. Who, in reality, are Batman and Robin. It heard you. It's trying. Not much of an answer. "Cowled crime fighters. Real identities unknown. " The next time we're in town, we'll pick up the parts for a dual-identity Bat-sensor. Now it's time for Bruce Wayne's lunch date with Pinky Pinkston and Dick Grayson's session with his French tutor. French tutor? That's one trouble with dual identities, Robin. Dual responsibilities. Oh, that is beautiful. Beautiful. - What's it called? -Shirley. A peignoir named Shirley? No, I'm Shirley. Lingerie Bazaar. Off at 6. We're completely neglecting Britt. No, I got the message, Pinky. Would I supply the third corner of today's triangle to tell you what I might know about the Green Hornet. Yes, very lovely. What size is it? Size 5,555,555? No. That's my telephone number. Ask for June. I do wish you two would quit flirting with the models and pay a little attention to me. Britt's doing all the flirting. I'm outside feeding the dog. You can't expect me to devote my entire time to you, Bruce. - Why not? - Because Britt's here too. That's right, I am. Well, where were we? I'll line up Batman in case Green Hornet decides to invade your factory tonight. And I'm to find out what the Green Hornet is up to in Gotham City. Oh, will you? I have so much at stake at that factory. I don't want any trouble. I'll deliver Batman. If I can reach him, of course. And all information on the Green Hornet will be transmitted. If I can get any. But aren't you mixing business--? With pleasure, Pinky? Business is my pleasure, darlings. Thank you. Well, Apricot, time for your pedicure. - Come on, Apricot. -You boys can fight over the check. - Good day. -Bye, Pinky. Good day, Pinky. Whose idea was this? Pinky invited me to lunch, and you invited her. Thank you. - I'm sorry, sir. -Mm, mm? The only alphabet soup we have is tomato, split-pea and clam chowder. Oh, too bad. You colonials are still so uncivilized. Well, I suppose I must go elsewhere. I have to drop by my stamp dealer's. He's a nice old gentleman named Boris Sevaroff. Though I think he sold me a bogus Blue Boar from Russian Samara. I've been having the same trouble with my collection. Paid a fancy price for some stamps that I don't think have a fancy value. - Why don't you come along? -Sure. Love to. I don't have anything to do tonight until the publisher's convention. I'd invite you to that but, uh, it's closed to visitors. Same with me. Meeting of the Wayne Foundation. Board members only. Ooh, da, da! Yes, of course, Mr. Wayne. The watermark on your Blue Boar stamp is indistinct, but naturally. Do you realize that only 12 of those stamps were ever printed? And that was over 100 years ago. And, of course, Russian Samara is a long way off. Ah, Mr. Wayne, who knows how far that stamp had to travel and what enormous perils it went through before it finally found its way to my poor establishment? Not quite as poor as it was the day before yesterday, Mr. Sevaroff when I paid a rather handsome price for the Blue Boar. I just hope that you are right. Are you implying that I hoodwinked you, Mr. Wayne? That I sold you a fake? No, of course not. But isn't it possible that you were hoodwinked? Nobody hoodwinks Boris Sevaroff. Speaking of valuable stamps have you ever noticed a stamp called the Gotham Gothic? It used to be in the collection of a Mr. Pincus Pinkston but upon his death, it vanished. Well, of course, I have heard of this stamp, Mr. Wayne but you must remember what a very small and perishable thing a single stamp is. It might easily have gotten lost or accidentally destroyed. Yes, most likely. I just thought I'd ask. Ha-ha-ha, well, gentleman. Gentlemen, a true pleasure to serve you. And I hope I have the opportunity once more before I return to my home, Volzhsky on the Volga. Good day. Good day. Good day. - Reprint? - Yes, boss? Shift into high gear. We have to move to the warehouse sooner than I thought. The pink neb's causing problems again? She's just one of my headaches. - I really smell trouble this time. -Too bad, boss. But you'll flip when you see my last batch of phony stamps. Not fuzzy at all. NARRATOR". But Colonel Gumm isn't the only one who smells trouble as he ends Boris Sevaroff's day's activities. And Britt Reid begins the Green Hornet's evening intrigue. I'm certain that Bruce Wayne's slippery stamp dealer and the foreman of the Pink Chip Stamps Factory are the same man. Involved in the counterfeit-stamp ring we're trying to crack? Undoubtedly knowing something about the missing Gotham Gothic. I have a feeling that Batman and Robin are gonna be on our tails tonight making our task that much more tricky. -How so? Well, to the world at large, they're known as the Caped Crusaders. Fearless crime fighters. Whereas, due to the nature of our operation the same world at large looks on us as criminals. Only a very few know different. Hm. Sure does sound tricky. So I'll turn my Hornet's Sting to half maximum power. I don't wanna get careless and hurt Batman if we clash. - Well, you always have your gas gun. -Right. And nothing must stop us from gaining our ends. NARRATOR". So to the battlefield. And speaking of warfare Now, don't lie to me, Colonel Gumm. I know what I've heard and I know what I've seen since. All I don't know is how I could've been so blind for so long. - Now, the first thing we're going to do-- -ls to lock you up, Miss Pinkston. In my office for now. We'll take her to the warehouse later on. First, we have to wind things up here. And then to make my big kill at the stamp exhibition tomorrow night. No sign of Black Beauty, Robin. We must have beaten it here. There's an alley around the corner. We can hide the car there. No Batmobile. Good. We can get some work done first, and fast. Holy split seconds. Let's go. Easy, old chum. I chanced to notice an open window back there. That sign on the door, "This means you"-- - Shall we say, "This means us"? -Us? You should know who I am by now. How about cutting me in on a little piece of the action? How big a piece? That depends on how much a stamp dealer named Boris Sevaroff can get for the missing Gotham Gothic. See, I know more about you than you think. We can take them all, Batman. That's a very sophisticated-looking piece of machinery. Yes, it's my own invention. The enlarged perforating and coiling machine. Why not give it a closer look? All right. He's not showing them the machinery, he's tossing them into it. The Green Hornet may posses the only clue to this baffling case. You know my motto, boys. "Always stamp out evil. " - Boss, look. -We move. Let's give them a thorough pasting. Come on, boys. Holy flypaper, Batman. We've all heard how the Dynamic Duo sticks together through thick and thin. But this time, you're really stuck, Batman on an undetachable glue pad. While the Green Hornet and his masked companion are being blocked, gummed, and perforated in that machine. You satanic, mad stamp man. Satanic, Batman? Who knows? But mad stamp man, perhaps. Ha-ha-ha! Behold, even as we speak my machine is producing a very rare stamp indeed. Ah! Wonderful. Shall we call him the Green Hornet'? The only stamp of its kind ever printed. I'm sure it would be a collector's item, if it were not for its size. Ah, the Green Hornet makes such a wonderful, beautiful stamp that I think I'll thumb-tack him to the wall. Holy human collectors item. Exactly, Boy Wonder. As soon as I tack up the other masked marauder who is even now being perforated in that machine then it will be your turns, Dynamic Duo. Yes, I know you've faced many deadly perils and escaped in many devious manners but you have never been so close to being completely stamped out as you are right now. 
NARRATOR". When last we saw the Dynamic Duo they were bound hand and foot in an outsized coffee cup and about to be scalded and scarred by sulfuric acid in full view of an unwitting throng in Chimes Square. Hold onto your beanies. They may not get out of this one. Goodbye, Batman. -It's been nice working with you. -Never say die, Robin. - We've been in worse scrapes than this before. -Well, not like this. The acid is about to pour. Quickly, plaster yourself against the side of the cup. What are you going to do? A little trickle of acid will proceed the big gush, Robin. If my timing and positioning are accurate perhaps those few drops will burn through these ropes. It's about to trickle over the lip, Robin. But there's many a slip twixt the cup and lip, Batman. - Very good, Robin. -Thank you, Batman. - Ah! -You did it. We're not out of the woods yet, old chum. I'll have to trip that switch with my Batarang. I don't know how we do it, Batman. What do you mean? The way we get into these scrapes, and get out of them it's almost as though someone was dreaming up these situations. Guiding our destiny. Things like that only happen in the movies, Robin. This is real life. I guess you're right. - Let's go. -After Catwoman? No. Those poor misguided students are still restless. Our first duty is to save them. To disperse them before they do something that might blight their lives. Catwoman will have to wait. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in a building across town the annual sale of priceless Batagonian cat's-eyes opals is about to begin at the Forever Jewel Company. Now, ladies and gentlemen as you know, each of these pouches contains $650,000 worth of cat's-eye opals. However, because this is the only place in the world where you can buy them we'll start the bidding at $750,000. You're not allowed to look in the pouches. Now, gentlemen, lady, what am I bid? I'll give you absolutely nothing for the entire lot. What? Who are you? I'm a Batagonian cat's-eye opal fancier and I think your prices are outrageous. Consequently, I shall take them off your lily-white hands for free. You're Catwoman. In the fur. Now, if you'll all assume positions of subservience we can complete this caper with a minimum of jeopardy and danger for all. On your knees, knaves. Penn pack up those baubles in your old kit bag. - Right, commissioner. -What's up? Catwoman made off with $12 million worth of Batagonian cat's-eye opals late last night. Holy bijou. That's very good, Robin. Bijou. French for "jewel. " Heh. Thank you, Batman. She's playing right into our hands. I planned it all this way. You mean you wanted her to steal the gems? Yes. Batagonian cat's-eye opals are notorious for the amount of great bad luck they bring to whoever steals them. I wonder if that amusing old wives' tale will hold true to form? You, of all people, don't believe in superstition, do you? Me? Superstitious? Nonsense. Ah! Never walk under a ladder, Robin. Batman, I'm surprised at you. Not at all. There is a custom based on fact. The ladder could fall and hit you on the head. Or someone could slip and fall from the ladder. It doesn't pay to court disaster, Robin. Let's go. Ah! Long time, no meow, Catwoman. - Where have you been? -Up the river. Ah, those are the pitfalls of the crime business. Well, what can I do for you? Judging from the looks of the place, I take it you're still in the fencing game? Well, you know I like to keep my skilled hands in stolen goods. - Ha. -Ha-ha-ha. You have something? Right up your alley. Ah! Spaghetti. Al Dente. A masterpiece. Sit down. Ah. I wish I could invite you to dine with me, but there is barely enough for one. I'm sorry. Batagonian cat's-eye opals. You said a triple soupgon. Forget it. Forget it? Every gendarme in Gotham City is looking for these. - It would be impossible to get rid of. -You got the best overseas contacts. It doesn't matter. There is a $3 million reward for these. You won't touch them. No. It's too hot. Besides, everyone knows that the Batagonian cat's-eye opals are bad luck for anyone who steals them. French Freddy, you are a fink. I wish I could help you, mon cheri, but you know how it is. Ha, ha. Well, here's my address. If you think of something - I'll cut you in. - Thank you. Come on, gang. - Ciao. -Ciao. Go ahead, Captain Courageous, tell him what you just told me. I'm very sorry, Batman, for ever having doubted you. That's quite all right, captain. You were only doing your job, and quite well. You couldn't have possibly known it was a Catwoman trick. Excuse me for a moment, but I have to phone Bruce Wayne. Keep him posted on Catwoman's exploits. He's her parole officer, you know. Yes, of course, commissioner. While you make that call I'll borrow the Batphone. -Good. What are you going to do? I've provided for emergencies like this, Robin. Now, you just watch. - I'm afraid he's not here, sir. -No, I'm here. Good gracious me. The Wayne phone will ring in a few seconds, Alfred. - Plug in the Bat-syllable device. -Right, sir. Hello. - This is Commissioner Gordon, Mr. Wayne. How are you? I'm calling to let you know that Catwoman's stolen several million dollar's worth of jewels. Have you called Batman? He's here in my office right now. Good. He'll catch her if anyone can. Sorry I wasn't a better parole officer. Call me if you have any further news. Goodbye. Goodbye, Mr. Wayne. Ah. It's eerie, Batman. Every time I talk to Mr. Wayne I get the feeling I'm talking to you. -Really? For a while I thought you and he were the same person. But here you are and I've just spoken with him on the phone. I guess that dissolves any tentative theory I may have harbored. Sure and it does. Bruce Wayne is a millionaire playboy. Hardly a secret identity for Batman. Ha, ha. How did it work, sir'? Superbly. Now, if you will program the Well-Known Criminals File and see who in Gotham City would be the most logical fence to handle a Batagonian cat's-eye opal heist. Batagonian-- Yes. There's only one name listed, sir. "French Freddy Touche. " - Corbin Place. - Thank you. - A lead? - Yes, I hope so. For all our sakes. Let's go, Robin. I'd heard about them out in California, Commissioner Gordon. But the idea of crime fighters in such fantastic costumes seemed too incredible to believe. We never had anything like that in Hollywood. No one will ever see the likes of them again. For some reason, they chose Gotham City to be the recipient of their derring-do and I, for one, bless the day they arrived on the scene. Long may they live. Did you come for anything specific, Batman? Or do you hope to pick up free pointers on fencing? Holy Zorro. Don't you know Batman is the best fencer in the country? You're still in the stolen-goods business, aren't you, Freddy? Me? A fence? En garde. Catch. You stain my name, French Freddy TouchÃ©. En garde, I say. - You were saying? -Has anyone been here trying to sell a treasure-trove of cat's-eye opals? -I do not accept stolen merchandise anymore. Now I am only interested in body-building. You know, in building bodies. Can't you see he's stalling, Batman? A man is innocent until proven guilty, Robin. That's provided for in our Constitution. I'll accept your explanation for the nonce. However, if we find that you've been prevaricating it will not go well for you. Let's go, Robin. Hi, Big Blanche, I've got a deal for you that'll-- Same to you, lady. Drat, drat double drat. Nobody wants the stuff? Can't give it away. - Someone's at the secret door. -Who could it be? Just one other person knows about that secret entrance. French Freddy, the Fence. Let him in. Bonjour, Catwoman. Ready to make a deal? No, no. I just wanted to tell you that Batman was, uh, how do you say, nosing around. Batman? We thought he was dead. He looks pretty good for a dead man. Triple drat. I have an idea that will take us all off the hook. I know that you cannot sell those opals so I thought it would be a good idea to turn them in for the reward. - What's your cut? -One-third. One million. That leaves us 2 million. Well, that's fair enough. Give him the opals, boys. But, Catwoman, how do we know we can trust him? We've got no choice. Thank you. Excuse me. What's so funny? - How you've been taken. -Taken? These are not the cat's-eye opals. - They are cleverly disguised paste replicas. -We stole them with our own eight hands. Well, then you went to a lot of trouble for nothing. These are imitation zircons that have been dipped in cherry frosting. And a poor grade of cherry frosting at that. Terrible. Taste. Batman did it. That dirty, rotten guy. I'll get him if it's the second-to-last thing I do. Brown I want you to take this message to police headquarters. Batman's pulled the fur over my eyes once too often. Amazing that you could have predicted her plot, Batman. You saved the entire nation of Batagonia with your brilliant foresight. To say nothing of my profitable business. The $3 million reward you've posted will flush her into the open, Miss Forever. How did you ever do it? When I learned that the student disturbance would be in the area of the gem exchange I simply put three and one together and came up with the answer. Hence, the switching of the gems. But by this time, she must have found out that we've hoodwinked her. Commissioner, within next few minutes, you can expect a message from Catwoman. Holy hypotheses. Yes, Bonnie. Send him in. What brazen impudence. She sent one of her men here with a message for you, Batman. Calm down, Brown. You're as jumpy as a cat. A message for you, Batman, from my boss-lady. "To Batman. Knowing what sort of a sport you are I realize you will release Brown to bring your answer back to me. Here is my proposition. I'm willing to give myself up, but only to you, Batman. Meet me at midnight in the model house at the Sherlock Holmes Real Estate Development in Suburban, Norchester. I promise to come alone if you do the same. Yours truly, Catwoman. " You can tell your mistress that I will agree to her terms. Right. -It's a trick. -She'll try and kill you. A bargain is a bargain, Robin. I must give her the benefit of a doubt. She said that she'd be there alone. But she's never told the truth in the past. Hope springs eternal. NARRATOR". it is midnight at the Sherlock Holmes Real Estate Development. Hello, Batman. You're a rare lady, Catwoman. You're right on time. I'm rare in more ways than that. I'm glad you decided to surrender. We would have caught you eventually. Do you think so? Certainly. There's no escaping the inexorable law of justice. - Shall we go? -Must we? So soon? I thought that, well, you know perhaps we might get to know each other a little better. I would think that we know each other well enough by now. Don't run away, Batman. I won't bite. I'm not afraid of you, Catwoman, I'm I'm, uh You're very beautiful, Catwoman. Yes. You're quite right. I am. Your propinquity could make a man forget himself. I don't know what that means but it sure sounds nice. I refer to the nearness of you. Batman let's throw caution to the winds. I mean, after all, we are two adult human beings and, uh, we're both interested in the same thing, happiness. I can give you more happiness than anyone in the world. How do you propose to do that? By being your partner in life. I mean, it's me and you against the world. Ooh. What about Robin'? Well, I'll have him killed. Painlessly. Well, he is a bit of a bore with his "holy-this" and "holy-that. " That does it, Catwoman. I thought you had a modicum of decency but I see that I erred in my judgment. You're supposed to fall on the floor. You're attractive, Catwoman, but not that attractive. I put on a double dose of Eau de Chat, that poisonous perfume. You should have been dead 30 seconds ago. Aha. Aha! So all of this lovey-dovey business was just a trick. Why aren't you writhing in pain? I had a hunch that you'd try some thing not quite kosher. I've been wearing Batplugs up my nose. I've been breathing nothing but clean, fresh air sans Eau de Chat perfume. You cheated. Ha! Put up your gloves, Batman. - I'm gonna practice the art of cat-rate on you. -Your mistake. Cat-rate, as you call it correctly pronounced "karate," is a defensive form. Therefore, in order for you to make a move I must move, and I won't. Well, I have another trick up my paw. Penn, Brown, Cornell, Freddy, get him! So you didn't tell the truth. Did you ever hear of crook who did? The odds are about right. Four against one. Four against two, Batman. - Robin. - I couldn't resist. You were taken in by her, but I'm too young for that sort of thing. Out of the mouths of Boy Wonders often times come gems. - You keep an eye on them. I'll go after her. -Right. I can never find my keys when really need them. Going my way? I wish I were, Batman. But we're fated to travel in different directions. You on the straight and narrow and me on the crooked and wide. Catwoman, it would be so easy for you to tread the path of righteousness. I'm afraid not, Batman. I need what every woman needs. The love of a good man. I'm sorry it had to end this way, Catwoman. Not half as sorry as I am, Mr. Wayne. Catwoman, you have destroyed my faith in my modern penological practices. Don't judge all criminals by me, Warden Crichton. There are a lot of cons that you have rehabilitated by your methods. I'm the exception, not the rule. Catwoman's correct. This is a model prison. Be proud of your work, warden. It's too bad we couldn't get to be better friends, Mr. Wayne. A good parole officer should also be a friend. I'd like to be your friend. There's no room for another man in my life, Mr. Wayne. You're nice but my heart belongs to Batman. Good bye. 
Batman We've already seen innocent shoppers. A stickup. It's The Joker! A clue. Yes, to oriental royalty. Theft of the gold golf clubs. After them. But no. . theft of the maharaja. Did the van vanish? Or shrink? Traced to their lair. But not surprised. Wrapped for mailing. Into the mailbox. Addressed tooblivion. Is there no way out? No way but up? Let's all hold our breath for one minute. The gasser is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na na na na na Batman Oh, no! Don't give up. Oh, they're so brave. Oh, yes, one must concede that, they have courage. I can't stand it. Oh, don't think about it, my dear. Think about how simple things will be with Batman out of our way forever. Think of all the things you can buy with what we can steal. That's a good idea. I better check the gauge. Oh! The gas is 20 feet high in the chimney. They must be gone. Goodbye, Dynamic Duo! - 'Joker, let's get outta here. ' - 'No, wait. ' 'First we must shut off the poisonous gas and pump it out. ' 'Some passerby might get killer. ' - Yeah, I guess you're right. - Aww. There. There. Okay, it's off. Get the truck and load up. Quickly. Quickly. Go on, boys. Go on, me lads. I think I'll check to make sure. Oh! Curses! They're getting away! Look! They discovered we're gone. Hey, boss. Hey, boss. Boss, boss. Look! Look, look. They're up on the chimney. I know that, you fool. - How'd they get up there? - They took the elevator. What do you think? Want us to get a rifle and-and shoot 'em? No, wait a minute, I've got a much more succulent idea. Get in. Get in. Strange, they're leaving. Perhaps they've changed their plans. Now, we'll have to find them again. Right. Let's go. Remember the maharajah's still in their power. Oh, drat! Nothing from this hole from the golf course or from the stolen hairpin. What did The Joker use the hairpin for? To trigger the gas bomb that knocked out the maharaja. The gas bomb. . Of course, if a trace of the gas remains. . We've got it! Uh-hah! That's it. It's an uncommon gas. I know of but one place in Gotham where it'd be available. The Ferguson Novelty and Magician's Supply Company. - That's it. - Right and we've got to hurry. If the maharajah isn't recovered soon it could make things very difficult with this government. In fact, I'm surprised there hasn't been-- - Let's go-- - Wait. We'll go. But as Dick Grayson and Bruce Wayne. Why? Do you think. . That it's being used as a front by The Joker? Exactly! Who does this remind you of? Careful, old chum. Good afternoon. May I help you? Thank you. We thought we might find some amusing favors for a small dinner party this young man's giving. To be sure. How about these? Very ingenious. Oh, miss, what is a "One-way glass reversing refractor?" A prism, which placed flush against any one-way glass 'will by refraction enable one to look' 'through the one-way glass' in the direction opposite to the one for which it was designed. You mean like one-way mirrors and stuff. 'Yes. ' You can look through from the wrong side. That's right. Gee, Bruce, this would be keen for spies, wouldn't it? Why don't you select something you like? And I'll just, uh, browse around. 'Anything suspicious?' No, just some squares. Well, what are you looking at? A big, fat bundle of ransom. And I think we've waited long enough. 'So, this is the photograph we took from across the street. ' Now, judging from the topography the underground prison room should be located about here, under the hill. Holy impregnability! It's as good as a fort. If the police try to break in The Joker would get too much warning. The maharajah could be injured. So, we have to find a way to get in secretly. But how? Fortunately, I got a glimpse of a large square grill in the back wall. What do you think it is? Unless I miss my guess, it's the cover for a ventilating shaft which comes out. . right here, on top of the hill straight above. Holy camouflage! What a way to get in. If only we knew where it was. If my trigonometry is correct. . and based on this photograph, it should emerge. . right here. Gosh, Batman. I'll never neglect my math again. Let's go. 'Batman, where are you?' Shh! Shh! If it's nearby they could hear us down under. I think I found it. How far did you say that room was underground? About 50 feet. Enough to give us good momentum. Oh, boy! I'll say. Can I go first? I wanna see their faces. Dynamic seniority. This could be a mistake I suppose. Well, look out below. Don't anyone move! You're all under arrest. It's Batman! Joker, where's the maharaja? I told you he'd find us, you clown. What's the matter with you, Batman? I'm the funny man around here. To arms, men! Repel the invaders. Alright, if that's the way you want it. Egads! The tide's turning against us. Let's scram, Joker. Ooh! We'd better. What happened? Where'd they go? Holy mole hill! They went into the mountain. 'Fiends!' Probably comes out the hill's other side. Where's the maharaja? I didn't see him when we entered. They probably moved him before we came. We'll make a thorough search. I don't expect to find anything. Commissioner Gordon. Oh, hello, Batman. Yes, I've been waiting for you to call. I-I hope you have good news for us. I'm afraid not, commissioner. We traced The Joker here to his hideout and surprised him but. . he eluded us I'm afraid. And the maharaja? There was no sign of him. If we don't find him soon, I shall have to notify Washington. Yes, I'm aware of that. Have you heard about the ransom yet? I don't know. You might send the wagon over here, there are. . four of The Joker's men to pick up. We're at the Ferguson Magician's and Novelty Supply. Okay, I'll take care of that. I'll notify thewait a minute. Commissioner, The Joker is on the air on our band he wants to speak to you. Good. Bring him in. Did you hear that? - 'Yes. ' - Well, hang on and listen. This is Commissioner Gordon's office, go ahead, Joker. 'Good evening, commissioner. Happy to find you in. ' 'Uh, perhaps you can do me a favor?' I warn you, Joker, if the maharajah is harmed we'll hunt you down if it takes a 100 years. 'By that time my jokes would be stale' 'wouldn't they, commissioner?' I haven't the time for chitchat with your kind. If you have something to say, say it! 'Very well. I want to talk to Batman, can you arrange it?' - Did you hear that, Batman? - 'Yes, I heard it. ' - Do you want to talk to him? - By all means. I just happen to be in touch with Batman now and we've set up a relay in the office. The next time you speak he'll hear your voice and you can hear his reply. 'What superb service. ' - 'Are you there, Batman?' - I'm here. 'Well, the fun and games are over, old fellow' 'and it's time for the harvest, as it were. ' 'I want to enlist your help in the ransom arrangements. ' Never. 'Now, don't take a stand until you've' 'heard everything, old boy. ' 'I've a friend here, who wants to talk to you. ' 'This is Maharajah of Nimpah speaking. ' Your Highness, are you alright? 'Quite alright, thank you. ' 'And enjoying delightful interval with bandit Joker. ' 'But now, time to return to business. ' 'Would Batman please arrange to cash a personal check tomorrow?' Your check? What for? 'For ransom money. What else. ' You're gonna cash the ransom check yourself? For how much? 'Half million dollars. US. ' 'How'd you intend to pay it to The Joker?' 'That is already arranged. ' 'between bandit Joker and maharajah. ' 'What is the matter? Do you not approve?' I certainly do not approve. I'll have nothing to do with it. You're free to do as you wish of course but. . leave me out of this. 'But unfortunate, not possible to leave you out. ' 'I will let bandit Joker explain. ' 'You see, that's part of the price, Batman. ' 'You make the arrangements. ' 'You be present when he cashes the check' 'and you endorse the check. ' 'Otherwise, no maharajah. ' It's a rotten bargain, Joker. But the maharajah's safety counts above everything else. You've won. The Gotham City State Bank. Main office, tomorrow morning, ten o'clock. Is it always darkest just before the dawn? Not when dawn, that is to say, 10 a. m. brings ruin and humiliation. 'Four hundred and fifty, four hundred and sixty, seventy. ' 'Four hundred and eighty. ' One half million dollars. There he is, right on time. This way, Your Highness. I am Prescott Belmont, Your Highness. I don't believe you've met Batman and his associate Robin. How do you do? I want to thank you for cooperating, Batman. Now, you have the money? Yes, it's all here. Ah. Good. Pay to the order of Battman. . One "T. " 'Five hundred thousand dollars. . ' and no cents. Now, you will endorse. It is a sad day for Batman. Forced to use his name for a criminal payoff. Yes. I'm afraid this will tarnish his image considerably. Good. Now, I will take the money. Don't you want to count it? Did you count it? Why, yes, of course. Why should we both count it? Oh, well. . Your Highness, do you actually intend to give this fortune to that criminal? Even though you're free and there's no necessity for it. Last desperate effort. Why not? You see, Joker is an honorable bandit. We made a bargain. He kept his side now, Nimpahnese gentlemen must keep my side. Yes, I can see that you'd want to keep your word even to a lying criminal. 'But to me Joker did not lie. ' 'You see, in my country a bandit is an honorable profession. ' 'And if people lie to bandits' pretty soon bandit will lie to people. And everybody will not believe the other and they will fight among themselves. 'And then, pretty soon nobody will have anything. ' 'Also in my country, population is 80 perc. . ' - Go! - Oh, no you don't. Batman, what are you doing? It's The Joker. 'That it is. ' But where's the maharajah? There isn't any. There never was. You mean, it was The Joker all the time? Right. As you recall, you never saw the two of 'em together. Then, his goal was not only a historic criminal coup but your disgrace as well. Not only that, my endorsement on a worthless check for half a million dollars. But if you hadn't thwarted him. . Oh, Batman, how did you ever see through his devilish plot? It wasn't difficult, if you remember the key to The Jokers twisted mind. 'He never means what he seems to mean. ' Now, why didn't we think of that? Also, it seemed strange that we'd heard no protest from his government. So, Batman called the Palace of Nimpah. The real maharajah. . 'is on a hunting trip in the Nimpah mountains. ' You've done it again, Batman. Egads! I'm deflated. A fitting end for you, Joker. Like the rest of your criminal ilk 'you were never anything' but a threatening bag of hot air. Chief O'Hara, call your men. Cart this human trash away. Right. An hour or so later at stately Wayne Manor where everything is now tranquil and serene or is it? Are you sure you want him, sir? I got the impression that he had just satisfactorily concluded the, uh, do. But I must speak to him immediately, please. If you insist, sir. No, Dick. You'll get as fat as the Maharajah of Nimpah. Who, Aunt Harriet? The Maharajah of Nimpah. I just saw his picture in the Gotham City Herald. He was on a tiger hunting expedition and you never saw anybody so fat in your whole life. Mercy alive, with all his money you'd think he could afford to see a doctor about a diet. It's the Bat-phone, sir. Now? That reminds me, Dick, I have a new volume on tiger hunting. It's in the study, I've wanted to show it to you. Holy Encore, you mean. . Gosh, Bruce, I'm real interested in tiger hunting. Excuse us, Aunt Harriet. Tea, madam? Oh, yes, Alfred. Yes, commissioner. Shocking news, Batman. What could it be? I've heard a most alarming rumor. That you've been asked to go to California and run for governor. Calm your fears, commissioner. The rumor is unfounded. As long as there's a criminal at large in Gotham City wild horses couldn't drag me away. Oh, thank heavens, Batman. Saints be praised. Goodbye, commissioner. Holy golden gate! Next week King Tut tangos with the Dynamic Duo. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na na na na na Batman 
Batman Gotham City on a pleasant morning. And in one of its most exclusive fur salons elegant ladies shop with doting husbands. This is just too spotty. What an elegant coat. And a magnificent color. Darling, what do you think? If you like it, darling, it's all yours. Oh, you're a dream. I just love it. Alright, everybody, stand still and no one will be injured! This is a stickup! Get out of here. Who are you anyhow? Your friendly neighborhood holdup man at your service, sir. What is this? A vulgar joke? Ah, yes. But the joke is on you, my good fellow. And there's nothing vulgar about half a million in furs. I do believe it's that arch criminal The Joker. Ladies and gentlemen, my staff of felonious furriers. Alright, everybody, to the center of the room. Come, come, come. A joke. What are more mink skins used for than anything else? To hold minks together. Mr. and Mrs. Prescott Belmont of the banking Belmonts I believe. Oh, what lovely jewels, Mrs. Belmont. And what a stunning coat. Well, thank heavens we haven't bought it yet. Uh, closer. Closer, everyone. Closer, closer. I want a tight little group. Alright, staff, get ready. - Take aim! - No. They're gonna shoot us down like cattle. Why, you filthy cad! Fire! And now, Mrs. Belmont, if you please. Oh, thank you, dear lady. I'm all stuck up. But of course, I said this is a stickup. Ha ha ha. And now to all, farewell. Staff, let us away. A hairpin? First we get a report that he's stolen a hole from a golf green. And now a hairpin? What is The Joker up to? About to start on another series of his dastardly crimes, I'll wager. - Then we'd better not delay. - Right. For there's no one else who can cope with the capers of that devilish clown. Right, Chief O'Hara. Though we may never know who he is behind his mask thank goodness he's there when a crisis befalls us. And in Wayne Manor, stately home of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward Dick Grayson. I'll solicit his presence, sir. But it's so much harder with the pieces upside down, Bruce. Of course. But think of what excellent training it is for your visual memory. Gosh, yes, I guess that's true. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes. It's the Bat-phone. Oh, boy, let's go! Well, where are they off to now? Eh? I just brought them a little snack. A call I believe, madam from Mr. Wayne's sporting goods supply. A superior new design of, uh, binoculars has just arrived. For their bird-watching. - Yes, commissioner. - 'Dire news, Batman. ' - 'It's The Joker again. ' - We'll be right there. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman Atomic batteries to power. - Turbines to speed. - Roger. Ready to move out. It arrived while you were on the way here, Batman. Timed perfectly. Then we'll proceed with extreme care. Robin. Chief, commissioner, stand back, please. - Holy jack in the box! - Saints alive. Strange, but. . harmless. A small recording machine with a tape on it. 'Play it, Batman. ' 'Good evening, commissioner. ' 'I assume Batman is there by now' 'so give him my regards, will you? Ha ha ha. ' 'Oh, by the way, did you hear what the maid said' 'when the duchess asked if she'd given the goldfish' 'fresh water that morning?' 'No, Your Highness. He hasn't yet used what he had yesterday. ' Not a very funny joke I'd say. The Joker's never arein the end. Do you suppose any of this could mean anything? Possibly. But not what it seems to mean. That's the key to The Joker's twisted mind. But why? It-it's not like The Joker to help us catch him. It could be a trap. Why would he want a hole from a golf course? The golf course! Of course! "His Highness, the Maharajah of Nimpah "arrived in Gotham City today and he's so rich he plays golf with jewel inlaid solid gold clubs. " That's it, Batman! The Joke on the tape! His Highness and the golden goldfish. And he's scheduled to play in one hour at the Winnie Coto Country Club. - Where he stole the hole. - Let's go. Be careful, Batman. Be careful. While at the exclusive Winnie Coto Country Club a sinister figure looms above the fairway. It's Batman. Crime is certainly rampant these days. Batman! - Batman I presume. - Correct. I'm Prescott Belmont, president of the club here. Got your message. I'll be glad to assist you in any way. Good. There could be more foul play here today. Has the Maharajah of Nimpah begun his round? Not five minutes ago with His Honor the Mayor. They're still on the first hole. Is there some vantage point overlooking the course? Any place where we won't be conspicuous. The lower terrace. Let's go. 'Odd. ' Everything looks serene. Let me look. Holy Taj Mahal! Look at those jewel-studded golf clubs! Yes. That would be a rich prize for The Joker. Very fine chip shot, Your Highness. What's so fine? It should've been closer. Yes, but the grass grows the wrong way, Your Highness. Ah, if this were only Nimpahnese blue grass. Out of my way, Your Highness. Mr. Mayor, please don't putt while I'm talking. Well, forgive me, Your Highness. Alright, go ahead. Batman! Something is happening! Looks like yellow gas. It is gas. Quick, to the Batmobile. Sorry to be so abrupt. This could be an emergency. Wait! It's not just the clubs, they're stealing the maharajah. Good heavens! With a forklift. Let's get going and make an emergency Bat-turn. Not this time, old chum. Gotta think of the golfers. The retro-rockets would burn up the course for a hundred yards. Holy tee shot! It's gone! But where? Holy shrinkage! A trick of some sort, no doubt. There's something inside. We'll see. It's a note. "Batman, did you hear about the kid "who wanted to sell his dog for $50,000? "He got his price. Traded it for two $25,000 cats. "But you can't make a deal like that for the maharajah "because we've got plenty of cats already. Don't call us, we'll call you. " - "Plenty of cats?" - Cats, cats and more cats! It could be an old refinery Katz, Katz, Katz & Company. It's been outta use for years, but it'd make a perfect hideout! It sounds too simple. Almost as if he wanted us to solve it immediately. - Gotta be on our guard, Batman. - Right. Let's go! How right they are, for inside the seemingly innocent old refinery The Joker and his crew prepare for company. Oh, my playful, pilfering pals this is going to be delicious. Bring the table in here quickly. Quickly. Put it right in the center. Now get the chairs. Get the chairs. One, one here, one over here, one there, one there, one there. Quickly. Everything must be just right. Now, how does that look, my pretty? - Oh, perfect, Joker. - Ha ha ha. Do you really think he'll come? Ah, he'll be here, never fear. You mark my words. Joker, why didn't you get me something longer than this when you had the chance? Oh, that's not my style, lovey. Any common hoodlum can do that. Oh ho, but never fear, my dear. We'll buy you countless fursand jewels. Oh, gee, Joker, you're perfect. - Yeah, practically. - 'Joker! Joker!' He just parked his car up the street! Excellent! Everybody, take your places. And you stand out of harm's way, my dear. There. Deal them out. What will we do, Batman? Use the Bat-ropes? Go in through the skylight? Let's try the direct approach. With his twisted mind, it could surprise him. Strange. It's not locked. Holy spiderwebs. A nest for rats. - Now. - We got you this time, Joker! Want to join the game, Batman and Boy Wonder? You'd better hurry. It won't last long. Holy looking glass! A truck with folding mirrors on its sides. No wonder it vanished. Yes, with nothing but the green of the golf course to reflect, it turned green too and seemed to disappear. But we're on to your tricks, Joker. You might as well. . Assemble now and intertwine Neatly wrap these guests of mine No more will they jeer and scoff I cut their circulation off If they do not see the joke Pull in the ropes and let them choke Holy. . It's like being caught in a barrel of snakes! Well, well, now I must say, this is an expected pleasure. You may have won the first round, Joker but we don't give up. Hmm, I've heard about Batman but this is the first time I've ever met him. And the last. So that's your dirty game. We might have known. Why didn't we think about this? - Think about it? - Yeah. What's this? Have you gone soft, my little savage? Well, I, uh, I-I bet he wouldn't try to knock you off if he had the chance. Oh, no, he'd merely try to incarcerate me in durance vile for the rest of my life. A fate much worse than death for a spirit such as mine. Stillwe might give them a sporting chance. - Yeah. - Oh, no, boss. We won't get another chance like this. That's right. We've gotta get rid of him. We owe it to the criminal world. Well, we'll see. Bring them along. Come, come, come. And now, my Dynamic Duo something I've been waiting to do for a long time. There, my funny ray has neutralized the gadgets in your utility belts for at least an hour. You're both good swimmers I hope. Fair. Then you can easily remain afloat for an hour I presume? If we weren't weighted down or something. Boss, you let these guys escape it'll be the mistake of your career. - 'Yeah. ' - 'You keep outta this. ' If he wants to give them a chance that's his business. Oh, well, perhaps they won't make it. Gentlemen, step that way, please. This is delicious. Absolutely delicious. Enough, enough, enough. Out of my way. I'll give you a few minutes to get out of these before I start filling that. And if you remain afloat for an hour, you go absolutely free. Now what more could you ask? I still suspect some trick. Now, now, let's not be bitter. I think we should give him the benefit of the doubt, Robin. . until he proves otherwise. - 'It's only fair. ' - 'I suppose you're right. ' Of course, he's right. Uh, gentlemen, be my guests. . Would you? Come, my darling. - Holy smokestack. - 'What a spot to get out of?' 'Right, Batman. ' 'There are only two ways to get outta there. ' 'One, I let you out' 'and two, you jump You still intend to free us if we can stay afloat for an hour? Oh, dear me. Surely you don't think I'd joke about such a serious matter as that, do you? No. Oh, time to start filling the tank. 'But that's gas. ' 'I do believe you're right. ' 'But then who said anything about water?' - But you can't float in gas! - No. But you can drown in it. Oh, Joker, that's a dirty trick. Oh, forget it, Jill. You didn't really think I was gonna pass up a chance like this did you, my peerless pair? 'Play traitor to all my principles and friends?' 'Oh ho ho, no. ' Ah, but one last word of advice don't stir it up. Too narrow in here to use the Bat-rope. There's nothing for them to catch on. And he's neutralized the rest of the stuff in the utility belt. What are we going to do? Unless there's someone to help us. . I don't know. But help from where? Not The Joker, certainly! And no one else knows where they are. Is this The Joker's crowning jest? Find out tomorrow night same time, same channel. But be prepared, no help is likely to come.

NARRATOR". When we last saw Batman and Robin they were locked into suits of armor and about to be pressed into paperweights by a giant hydraulic crusher. In just one moment we'll see the crunching finish of our adventure. Batman. Robin. How did you get in there? The Penguin evidently loaded us into one of your scrap trucks. But of course you couldn't have known that. How did you manage to stay alive inside that crusher? It develops a hundred thousand pounds of pressure. Fortunately, we were able to reach our Utility Belts where we always keep our emergency Bat air pumps to pump up the Batmobile's tires. You mean you countered the hydraulic pressure with air pressure? As the crusher increased its pressure it automatically increased the counter-air pressure and we were able to maintain a small safety space inside this scrap-metal cocoon. It's lucky you think fast, Batman, or both of you would have ended up as paperweights. Obviously that's what Penguin intended when he put us inside your scrap truck. I think it's time we scrapped him. I think so too, Robin. I think so too. Now, let's get that priceless armor into the safe. Why do we have to put it in the safe, Pengy? Don't you trust us? - You got any more stupid questions? -Uh, no, boss. All right, then close the door. And lock it, fink. Now, where is that dizzy filly of soul and her dizzier aunt, huh? I'm not so sure I like being called dizzy, darling. And I'm not sure I like all those bumpkins cluttering up my nice cave. Where have you two been all this time? Out looking for old toads, darling. You did say you wanted one of Aunt Hilda's potions. Absolutely essential as a grand finale to our diabolical caper. Well, I don't know if I'll make it for you. Barging in here like a rude gang of rowdies. Oh, don't be angry, Aunt Hilda. After all, Penguin has no place else to go. No, aunty. You wouldn't want a poor, homeless bird thrown out into the street, would you? - Quack, quack. -You're lucky I'm softhearted. Run along, darling, and make your potion. Pengy and I want to talk. Mm. Frankly, Pengy, I don't see why you need Aunt Hilda's love potion to break into the subtreasury building. Why? Because those guards are as dangerous as sharks, that's why. There's $10 million worth of gold in that subtreasury. Why don't you just use the suits of armor? That worked once. It won't work a second time. No, we need your aunt's famous love potion to demobilize the guard. And once we're inside the vault, then what? You'd need a railroad train to move that gold. Once we get inside, we'll use the plans I stole from the Hexagon. - Ah! - Ha-ha-ha. Oh, dear. My lizards are gone. Gone? They must have escaped. Unless those thugs ate them. That's hardly likely, darling. Are the lizards essential? Not as essential as the toad, but the potion won't be as strong. It has to work. We can't take chances. Now, now, don't get yourself in a stew, Pengy. - I think I'll give the potion a little help. -How? You've heard of my famous dance of the seven veils, haven't you? Well, with my dance and Aunt Hilda's potion, we'll have an unbeatable combination. That swindler. Throwing the Dynamic Duo into a scrap truck. I'd like to throw him into a scrap pile. Rock pile would be more appropriate, chief, since there is one at Gotham State Prison. Unfortunately, this won't get back the medieval armor or the military papers he stole from the Hexagon, gentlemen. According to General MacGruder, Batman when the Penguin broke into Room Z at the Hexagon all he took were some old plans dating from World War ll. With all the top-secret documents in that room, Penguin just took outdated plans? That's right. Now, what would he want with them? Did General MacGruder say what plans were taken? No, those old plans were taken off the inventory lists years ago. It will take the Army many years to check back and find out which ones were stored there. But it only took the Army hours to supply us with those special metal-piercing bullets in case Penguin tried to use those chain-mail suits again. I'm sure Penguin won't try that trick again. But the problem is to decide which trick he will try. And where will he strike? And how do we get back that priceless armor? And on top of everything else, the police switchboard is flooded with calls about hundreds of lizards running around the Murray Park section of Gotham City. Lizards, Chief O'Hara? That's right, Batman. And weird ones they were too. Robin, do lizards ring any bells for you? Marsha's aunt Hilda. I suggest we take a trip to the Murray Park section. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in the basement of the subtreasury building $10 million worth of gold bullion is being carefully guarded. Boy, this sure is a boring job. Nothing ever happens here. Yeah, it's pretty routine. Who'd ever think of breaking into a subtreasury? That gold's too heavy to move anywhere. You hear anything? Yeah. Hey, you there. Put your hands up. That should take care of them for a while. All right, finks, bring that stuff in here. Quick. Quiet. Come on. At least 20 people reported seeing lizards come out of this manhole, Batman. Yes, Robin, and I think we'll find what we want at the other end of it. There is no honor among thieves, Robin. Batman and Robin. How did you get in here? Put the Batcuffs on him, Robin. Oh, you'll never crack that safe, Batman. Just put your hands in these and cut the comments. You did it. It's not difficult if you have steady nerves and a good ear qualities destroyed by the tenor of criminal life. Well, the laugh's on you, Batman. That's nothing compared to the haul he's getting now. Heh, heh. - And what's that? - Well, he's-- Oh, no, you don't, Batman. I might steal, but I don't squeal. And like the Penguin says, after this caper, Gotham City is gonna be in the soup. Thank you. You've just told me where Penguin is. - What? -Clip his cuffs to the safe door, Robin. While we make a fast trip. How did that remark tell you where Penguin is? It wasn't what he said, Robin, but what Penguin had said. You mean about being in the soup? Knowing the Penguin's twisted mind, he could mean only one thing. - Soup? -Name a few, Robin. - Chowder. -Mm. - Stew. -Mm. - Ragout? -Mm. - Bouillabaisse. -Mm. Bouillon. Bullion. Exactly, old chum. Bullion. Penguin is undoubtedly at the federal subtreasury at this very moment. And I'd better call Chief O'Hara. - F our. -F our . - Five. -Five. Hurry up. Hurry up. How much longer is Penguin going to take? I'm down to two veils. I'm just getting warmed up, darling. - Six. -Six. Good. That's the last of it. Come on, Aunt Hilda, let's go. - Oh. Really, dearie? -Really. Oh. - Oh, no, Marsha, don't go. -No. Marsha, we adore you. We won't let you out of our sight. That's very sweet, darlings, but I really must be going along. - No, no, Marsha. -No, no. Here, dear. A little something to remember me by. Come on, aunty. Excellent performance. Your audience is still spellbound. It's a good thing you finished. I was beginning to run out of veils. And love potion. Batman. How did that fink get off the scrap heap? Never mind that now, darling. We'll be on the scrap heap unless we beat them into the vault. There they are, Robin. We missed them. On the contrary, Robin. We didn't miss them at all. I see what you mean, Batman. He's got the gold, but we've got him. Are we too late, Batman? No, chief, we're just in time. Where's Penguin? That's beautiful, Batman. What an ironic end for that crook. But he never should have gotten in here in the first place. - Have you got them, Batman? -Yes, commissioner. And this time I don't think there's much chance of them slipping through our fingers. Not through three feet of steel, there isn't. - Did you send men to that underground cave? -Yes. We've recovered the armor. And it won't be long before we recover Penguin. There's only enough air in that vault to last a couple hours at most. I can't wait to get me mitts on that cackling bird. It's been six hours, Batman. How are they breathing inside there? Ah. Ah. How much longer? It's gonna take a while yet, Pengy. It's a big job. Don't worry, we can stay in here as long as we want. Only thing is, if I keep having to listen to that, I'll go straight. Can't you make her stop? Aunty only gets nervous in closed rooms, darling. This keeps her occupied. Eugh. Not worth the price. Why don't you try biting your nails? Penguin could have carried tanks of compressed fresh air inside with him, but that's not what worries me. - What, then, Batman? -Why, commissioner? Why? Why did Penguin let us trap him so easily? I'm sure it has something to do with those plans he stole from the Hexagon. - Whatever they are. -But he couldn't possibly escape, Batman. Why, even if he blew a hole in the wall, I've got 200 men stationed outside. I'm sure that you and your fine force of men in blue can handle anything in the realm of the ordinary, chief. But I have a hunch Penguin is cooking up something quite out of the ordinary. Robin, do you have your Bat-sound amplifier with you? Sure, Batman. Holy stereo. Listen to this. This is the third day Penguin and his henchmen have been holed up inside the subtreasury vault. Three days, Alfred. Imagine that. What can he be doing inside there? I imagine that our law-enforcement agencies are asking the same question, madam. What could that mangy creature be doing in there? I wish I knew, chief. And what's he doing for food? I wish I knew, commissioner. - And what's he--? -I wish I knew, Robin. Pass the paprika, dearie. Mm, mm. This is the best batch of toad stew I've ever made. Somehow I don't think the men are too enthusiastic about your cuisine, darling. I don't see why not. Do you know how much vitamin B there is in the average toad? No. Just twice the daily minimum requirement. Well, what's for dinner tonight? I'm starved. Huh? Let me see. On. Agh. Not again. Can't you cook anything else? Do you have any idea how much vitamin B there is in the average toad, darling? I have a feeling that Penguin will make his move very soon. Whatever it is, Batman, we're ready for it. I'd like to check the outside of the building again to be prepared for every eventuality. Well, Pengy, we're finished. Finished? Ah, let me see. Let me see. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. Heh. That Batman thought he had me all wrapped up. That should teach that Caped Codfish something. Never count your Penguins before they're latched. Everything looks shipshape, Batman. Even if he blows his way through the wall, we'll nail him before he goes ten feet. Yes, it would seem that way, but I'm still worried. Listen. What's that noise? Holy armadillos. Take cover. A solid gold tank. So those were the plans Penguin stole from the Hexagon. Yes, it all makes sense now. He set up his film company to steal the armor from the museum. He used the armor to steal the plans from the Hexagon. And used the plans to build a solid gold tank. - Now he's invulnerable, Batman. -No one is invulnerable, commissioner. Not even inside a tank. I'll stop that mangy bird if it's the last thing I ever do. - What's Chief O'Hara up to? -Chief O'Hara! He's blocked the tank. - But he'll be crushed like a walnut. -The brave fool. - Chief O'Hara! -Quickly. Help me with this. Watch it, Batman. I never ever thought I'd see your face again, Batman. That was a brave gesture, Chief O'Hara. We need more than gestures to stop that fiend. Quickly, to the Batmobile. - Are you all right, chief? - Look what he done to me. How's it feel riding around in $20 million, Marsha? The springs aren't very good, darling. Springs? Every bolt of this machine is worth a carload of springs. Who's firing that gun? Must be Aunt Hilda. She loves loud noises. - Oh! - Stop that! Those shells are solid gold. Every time she fires that cannon, it costs $50,000. Oh, let her have some fun, Pengy. After all, you're a millionaire now. Even a millionaire blinks at $50,000. We should be able to intercept him at the next crossroads. Roger. But what do we do when we intercept him? Can you handle the Batzooka? The Batzooka. I forgot all about it. You bet I can handle it, Batman. I hope your aim is good. Heh, heh. They're not even following us. They knew it was hopeless. Even Batman and Robin were smart enough to see that. Looks like Batman and Robin weren't so smart after all, darling. Hmm? Whoa! Blow them to bits. Sound general quarters. Batten the hatches. Dive, dive. Easy, Robin. That's a low-down, underhanded trick. Oh, and foiled again. It's exasperating. Oh. Be a good loser, darling. Page from your own book, huh, Penguin? It's your fault! Wasting those golden shells. Be quiet, dearie, or I'll turn you into a toad. Should I, Batman? -Thank you, we have other plans for Penguin. You know, darling, it really is a shame. You and I could have had a marvelous career in movies. I'm afraid your movie career will be interrupted for quite a while, Marsha. It was very nice of Batman to donate Penguin's film to the Wayne Federation of Boys Clubs. I'm sure the boys will enjoy it. Too bad Penguin and Marsha can't see it. Somehow I doubt if they'd want to, Dick. Besides, by the time they get out of prison, this film will probably be on the late show. Whatever happened to that weird old lady who was related to Marsha? -Aunt Hilda? She's back at her old post, teaching a cooking class at the Bruce Wayne School of Home Economics. She never would have left in the first place if it hadn't been for her niece Marsha. You know, Bruce, I think Batman is quite a good actor. Oh, my, he's very romantic. I think Batman would appreciate your compliment, Aunt Harriet. Well, perhaps Batman has some show business in his blood. Hmm. Don't we all, sir? Don't we all? 
Batman Last night we saw an unwitting victim. . fall for a fishy trap. Caught by the finny fiends. Umbrellas. . The sign of the Penguin. The Caped Crusader is on the trail. A brainwashed butler. He remembered nothing. Batman was baffled. The meeting of the millionaires. And their worthy causes. Could they be part of. . a Penguin plot? A clue. . send the dynamic duo to a fishing pier. Alone in a forest of umbrellas. Beware, Batman! Too late! Into the vacuum tank. Less air. Less. Less. And when the last balloon bursts. . Wait! The last gasp is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na na Batman Hold. . Hold on, Robin. Hold on. They're still breathing. How in the name of purple wombats do they manage that? Check the air indicator. Not enough for a mouse. Mouse? It's too much. Let it drop below Butterfly. Pull it out much faster. Suck the air out faster. Ah! That's better. Now, my little polly let me know the instant it drops below Butterfly. Well, hello, my leather-lunged adversary. Let me see you try to breathe now. Butterfly! Butterfly, Batman. Butterfly. 'Watch the bouncing balloons. ' 'Going, going. . ' 'gone!' They're done for! They're, both of them, done for! Hip hip hurray! Hip hip hurray! Oh, fondest dreams. . Oh, secret hopes. . At last, I have defeated the dynamic duo. What are we standing here for? Off we go. Off we go. But, boss, don't we gotta get rid of the bodies? Yeah. First things first. First we establish an alibi and then we destroy the evidence. Move move move already. I must find me a fine-fitting alibi. Quick, hurry! Robin. Wake up, Robin. 'And once I freed Robin' 'I carried him out' 'of Penguin's vacuum tank' 'to the Batmobile' 'and here we are. ' Well, I can understand how you got away but one thing puzzles me. You say it was a vacuum tank. If so, what did you breathe? He breathed air, chief. But there wasn't no air. But there was. The emergency tank of bat-oxygen right here in my utility belt. After cutting my bonds with my bat-knife. . The rest was simple. Thank the saints for the utility belt. Holy oxygen! It's a good thing one of us thought of that. Incredible. - Isn't it, chief? - Yes, sir. Only you could be so resourceful. Only you could put that pusillanimous Penguin to flight. The salt fishing pier, you say? I'll have the dragnet out in ten minutes. I'll put Penguin back up the river before he can bat an eye. It's no use, Chief O'Hara. Not even a dragnet could trap him now. He got away? We scoured the entire pier. By the time Robin and I were free the Penguin had fled. But don't fret about it, Chief O'Hara we'll have another chance. Another chance? I don't see how. You're forgetting the Penguin's plot, commissioner. The millionaire's award dinner. Jumpin' codfish, it's all we have. Now, he won't give that up, will he? Not when there's 12 million in cash involved. What shall we do, Batman? Stop him of course, commissioner. But how? We don't even know where the dinner is. No, we don't. But there's one man who does. The man who arranged the entire dinner in the first place. Multimillionaire Bruce Wayne. Good thinking, Batman. Of course! Bruce Wayne. Contact him immediately. You should be able to reach him in his mansion. Then call me. I shall arrange a counterplot. Right. Bruce! Mr. Gordon, how are you? In need of help, Bruce. Your ward, Dick Grayson, told me I could find you here. I'm flattered. How can I help Gotham City Police Department? Well, information is what we need most at the moment. Uh. . We must know where the millionaire's award dinner will take place. Why is that information so important, commissioner? We're expecting the Penguin to strike again. The dinner will be held in the captain's dining saloon aboard the flagship of the Wayne Steamship Company. The S. S. Gotham Neptune. Thank you, Bruce. Now, you must excuse me I have a multitude of details to work out. Yes, of course, commissioner. He's right here, sir. Yes, commissioner? You spoke to Bruce Wayne. And? Good. Call him back and tell him. . Of course, commissioner, I'll assist in any way I can to help you and Batman trap Penguin. You want our little group of multimillionaires to do what? The rest is quite simple really. Word has been leaked via the underworld grapevine that the millionaire award dinner will be held. . here. 'Wayne Manor. ' But it will not be held there. Instead, it will actually be held. . here. 'In the captain's dining saloon' aboard the flagship of the Wayne Steamship Line. The Gotham Neptune. Holy rudder! You mean that while that dinner's being held onboard. . meanwhile-- Meanwhile, the Penguin and his criminal cohorts will close in on the mansion. Right into the arms of the waiting place. Golly, Alfred, it's a perfect plan, isn't it? Perfection indeed, Master Robin. The police to pounce on the Penguin 'Batman and you at the banquet' to safeguard the millions. And speaking of perfection, sir if you'd excuse me, I have much to prepare. The menu for the banquet. Everything from caviar to crepes suzette. Not to mention the giant cake out of which will pop the young lady chosen to represent the charity this year. Yes, indeed, sir. Oh, and, sir. . Yes, Alfred? Which young lady has been chosen? The honor falls to Ms. Natural Resources. She is our chosen charity for the year. Very good, sir. Holy jitterbugs! That twitch again. Poor fellow. But he was kidnapped. Batman, I have a horrible thought. Can we trust Alfred? Implicitly, Robin. I trust Alfred implicitly. Mr. Wayne's residence. Alfred speaking. Who is that speaking? Who else but Penguin? Remember, Alfred? I remember. The time and place of the millionaire's dinner. Report. Word has been leaked via the underworld grapevine that the millionaire's award dinner will be held here. Here? Where? Wayne Manor. But. . But what? Answer, you soporific servitor! But it will not be held here. - Actually, it will be held. . - 'Yes?' in the captain's dining saloon. . And? Onboard the flagship of the Wayne Steamship Line. - 'Yes?' - The Gotham Neptune. The Gotham Neptune. And the winning charity? Ms. Natural Resources. Good. You have remembered. Now, you will forget. Hello? Hello? Hmph. No one there. That's fine. Now, come on. Batman is on his way up. - We gotta be ready. - Batman? I thought Bruce Wayne was gonna escort me. He's out of town, Batman is filling in. Stand still, will you? All you gotta do is jump out of that cake and let him throw money at you. Hey, what's this? What are you doing? Quick, quick, my little goldfish. Quick, quick, you fumbling finks. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Out! Courage, my little haddock. Psst. Psst. Ms. Natural Resources? Yes. And you're my escort. I'm so thrilled. - I trust you like orchids. - I love them. They're my favorite. Do you mind if I put them on in the elevator? Well, it's so drafty standing here. No, of course not. How rude of me not to have noticed. Oh, by the way, have you ever popped out of a cake before? No. But I've been practicing. Good. Then there should be no trouble at all. No trouble. Two hours later. . aboard the gaudy Gotham Neptune. . - Nice dinner, Alfred. - Thank you, sir. Mint? Or would you prefer a chocolate almond? No, thank you. Say, Batman, isn't it about time? I'm very anxious to donate my million dollars. Shall I bring in the piece de resistance, sir? Piece de resistance? French, sir. It refers to the feature of the evening. Oh, yes. Of course! The giant cake. Yes. Yes, Alfred. As Mr. Wayne's stand-in it's my job to keep things moving. You may fetch it now. At once, sir. You may come out now, young lady. Millionaire's row. Down they go like diamond-studded ten-pin. Batman! Master Robin! Oh, what have I done? My. . Get the loot, then back to the pier. The pier? But, boss, the fuzz know all about the pier. Wise up, you finny fools. They found it empty. That's the last place they'd expect me to go. Victory for the fishy foul. Can this be? Unmoving, silent. . the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder. Oh, gloom! Oh, doom! Boss, you got it! Let's see it, boss. The money. The millions. Feast your eye there. Makes me mouth water. How about our cut? You wanna swallow the whole thing in a gulp, do you? Here, my fine finny finks. Here's a few hundred fish for the hors d'oeuvres. Hey, boss, you know what I'll do with my cut? I'm going to the South Seas and open up a school for pirates. Do what you like but with my giant share I'm going to put it in the safe. Not for me the simple life blowing under the breadfruit tree. No, my share will be used for nobler purposes. To escalate the cause of crime. - What crime, boss? - Well, the bigger, the better. Now that I'm rich, I can bribe, I can borrow I can scheme, I can connive. What's the matter, Finella? You look forlorn. Maybe she's cold, boss. She forgot her fur coat. That's the problem, huh? Here, buy another. Buy a dozen of them. Now you stop that. Stop it. I can't stand the gurgling of tears. No, I can't take it. It's not mine. Not the coat, not the money. Not anything. Just because I wanted to win a beauty contest. Ah, my little gold pigeon, little tadpole, you did win it. When you popped out of that giant popover and we won this! No. I cheated. And you cheated. And that's for charity, not for cheats. Who's gonna save our natural resources now? 'Good girl' The dynamic duo! You have learned your lesson. Crime never pays. - Batman! - But it can't be. We gassed you at the party. We prepared ourselves beforehand with anti-Penguin gas pills. Beat me back here to boot, but you'll never get me alive. No! Robin! Hoist in your own evil net. You'll pay for this. Not before you do, Penguin. Behind bars. Robin, call the police. Tell them the culprit is theirs. Alfred! Oh, may I have some of that please? Oh. Thank you. Isn't this a lovely party? Yes, isn't it? Oh, I do hope all that money will be safe this time. You may rest assured, madam. Now that the Penguin is in the pen Mr. Wayne says that the award dinner will proceed in complete safety. Oh. No, I don't know any more than what was in the newspapers. Just that Batman and Robin came to the rescue. And in the nick of time, if I may say so, Master Dick. Excuse me, will you? I shudder when I think of what might have been. That was not your fault, Alfred. Oh, but it was. Allowing myself to be brainwashed by Penguin. I gave away the whole plot. On the contrary, Alfred without you. . Batman would have never succeeded. Sir, you mean, you knew that I was brainwashed? We certainly did. That's why Batman made sure you had the information so that you in turn could pass it on to Penguin. We were all prepared, Alfred. Even pretending to be unconscious when Finella popped out of the cake and used the gas umbrella. And speaking of Ms. Finella. . I see that you got my invitation but I never thought that you would make it. I brought her down for the party myself. I'm so happy to be here. And, oh, thank you, for the coat. I don't deserve it. But we millionaires decided that you do. After all, did you not assist Batman and Robin in capturing the-- Please, don't mention his name. When I think that I almost helped him get away with all those millions. Almost, but not quite, little lady. That's why we managed to get permission for you. That Batman, such a wonderful person. Mr. Wayne, do you think that I'll ever get to see him again? Who knows, my dear? Perhaps, someday you may. Now, may I help you with your wrap? - Oh. - It's alright. You're amongst friends here. Take it. Well, someday when you've paid your debts to society you may be released from prison not only for one day but forever. Oh. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". A quiet, balmy midnight in Gotham City. Not a creature is stirring . . . except these creatures. Though they're barely stirring. And this creature. An Egyptian king? And a tank full of crocodiles? In our beloved borough? Yes, my babies. Sethos, how's my crowning achievement coming? Any news from the Royal Lapidary? Unless he's behind schedule, he should be opening that safe at this very moment. Dig this perfect blue-white diamond. Sixty-eight carats if she's an ounce, or my name ain't Amenophis Tewfik. The king did not send me, his Royal Lapidary, for diamonds. What's going on? How did you get in here? I can't have this sort of thing, you know? I advise you both to remain quite motionless while I summon the authorities. Ah. This should be more to His Kingship's taste. - What is it? -A string of amber beads. Amber beads? Exactly, Tutly. With beauties such as these His Royal Kingship shall hatch an infernal scheme that within a fortnight should have all of Gotham City in his royal clutches. Miss Patrick, a headache pill, please. I still don't quite understand how you could be rendered unconscious by a lead pencil. Pestle, commissioner. A lead pestle. Which my assailants dropped in their escape. Hmm. Uh, no, no, Miss Patrick, I don't need a pill. It's for Mister, uh Oh. Time for your mid-morning vitamin, commissioner. Oh, really? Oh, well, what do you know. All right, thank you. Pestle. A lead pestle. Odd sort of weapon, don't you agree? And rather odd assailants, come to think of it, in their strange Egyptian garbs. Egyptian? Well, there can be no doubt about it, commissioner. The mad monarch must once again be on the loose. And have something even madder than ever up his fourth-dynasty sleeve. Gentlemen, I propose to call Batman. Yes, commissioner? A strange and terrible threat to Gotham City. An ultimatum from the remote past. I think it's King Tut. We're on our way. Holy hieroglyphics. This might mean a battle royal. Not the first, Dick, nor the last. To the Batpoles. Egyptian garb, amber beads, lead pestles. Can there be any doubt about it, Boy Wonder? Only the shadow of a doubt perhaps but certainly worth a telephone call to Yale University. That's a sharp idea. Positively trenchant, Batman. Miss Patrick. - Something for you, Batman? -No. No pills. No, thank you, my dear. I seldom resort to medication of any kind. You see, one's body has remarkable restorative powers of its own. Miss Patrick, please, just get Dean Gerber on the telephone for Batman at Yale University. Yes, sir. I would hate to think that our eminent professor of Egyptology had suffered a relapse into his eerie twin trauma. You're too soft on hardened arch criminals, Batman. But, Chief O'Hara, he really believed Gotham City was ancient Thebes and that he himself was the reincarnation of King Tut. Dean Gerber on three. Uh, you take it, Batman. Hello, Dean Gerber. This is Batman. Batman. B-A-T-M-A-N. That's right, Dean Gerber, in Gotham City. I'm calling in reference to your professor of Egyptology. Oh? When did he take over the chair? And his predecessor? Oh. Yes, that's what I was afraid of. Thank you. Goodbye. Bad news, Batman? It couldn't be worse. The professor fell off the podium during a teach-in and hasn't been seen since. Holy sarcophagus. That means he's a supercrook again. But what kind of a supercrook would scoff at genuine diamonds and rubies and then have his stooges make off with a string of amber beads? Some of them even with beetles in them. Beetles, Chief O'Hara? You mean scarabs imprisoned in amber? A lead pestle. Pestles haven't been made of lead since the turn of the century. Does that suggest something, Batman? Yes. An apothecary. A word recently superseded by that of druggists or pharmacists. Commissioner, do you have a copy of the Gotham City classified directory? Miss Patrick. No, no pills, please. Just bring Batman the classified directory, please. It would be a pleasure. I'm afraid the summer relief girl for my regular secretary Bonnie isn't much of a relief. She seems eager to please, a virtue in anyone. That will be all, Miss Patrick. Thank you. Thank you. Aha. Just as I surmised. Of the dozens of pharmacies, the scores of drugstores in Gotham City there's only one apothecary. The Apex Apothecary Shop in the Pyramid Building. Doubtless to be found on the top floor. Let's pay them a call, Robin. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in a back room of the Apex Apothecary Shop the demented despot is engaged in an unholy operation. What kind of black magic is this? An attempt to release the dead from their ancient tomb? If you ask me, giving them bugs the hot-foot ain't gonna do nothing. Dead is dead, or my name ain't Amenophis Tewfik. These are not bugs, Amenophis. They are scarabs of a species extinct for at least 4000 years. Encased in amber, they have slumbered away the centuries in a state of suspended animation. And now I shall begin their shock treatments to reactivate their little nervous systems. About 100,000 volts, wouldn't you say, Royal Apothecary? I concur, doctor. Power. - Power. - Amps. Amps. - Air. - Air. One hundred thousand volts. One hundred thousand volts. Oxygen. Oxygen. Breathe, my children. Free yourselves from the arms of Osiris. Shake off the shackles of the sepulcher. Live. Live. Live! They ain't living. More oxygen. I'm going to 200,000 volts. Failure. Abject failure. All my plans all my dreams of domination, crumbled into dust. I shall end this miserable existence by throwing myself off the Aswan High Dam. How about that? That cockroach is really kicking. No, it's not. You're just saying that to make me feel good. They're all kicking. Look, Your Kingship, you've got yourself a batch of real live ones. I have? Thank heavens. I have! Gee-whiz, Batman, dropping in on a drugstore might have been easier. Exercise never hurt anyone, Robin. We must always keep the element of surprise on our side. What are you doing here? I might ask you the same question. Pursuing enemies of law and order wherever they happen to be. Aren't you in the wrong city? On special assignment for The Daily Sentinel. You know my aide, Kato. Robin, the Boy Wonder. Well, I don't wanna hold you up from your crime-fighting. Thank you, and good luck to you, Mr. Hornet. Nice to have met you. Gosh, Batman, what are they dressed like that for? They live, they live! Shh! What's that? It's the burglar alarm bell on the main shop window. Go see who it is. Don't just stand there. Go see who it is. Gentlemen, you might have found the elevator a little more convenient. But what form of curative do you require? Nothing, thank you. A nostrum called nothing? That I do not carry, sirrah. But I do have all kinds of potions lotions and notions in stock. No, nothing. And, uh, what's in the back room? Trolls and ghouls and amulets. Evil spells that will turn your bones to celery stalks. Nevertheless, I think we should take a look for ourselves. But, no! Take another think, Batman. We took care of them. We powdered them, boss. Good. Through the backdoor, down the fire escape. Bolt the door behind us. Here, here. Too late, Robin. Thanks to a well-equipped apothecary. Foiled again by that fat pharaoh. What's that? Look. Look. Holy Frankenstein. -It's alive. -Yes. - But what is it? -Scarabaeus sacer. A specie of ancient Egyptian beetle sacred to the sun god Hymeopolos and from which the term "scarab" is derived. You should know that, Robin, if you're up on your studies of Egyptology. You're right. Ah. Think of it. Think of it. An insect like this, extinct for centuries suddenly unleashed on our community. I know hieroglyphics self-taught are a chore, Robin. But it's a surefire way to unravel the secrets of the ancient mystics. You mean you've discovered what that moonstruck monarch is up to? I fear so. Inscribed upon this ancient papyrus scroll is the chemical formula for abu raubu simbu tu. Abu what? Abu raubu simbu tu. In more modern terms: CK to the second power plus OL to the ninth power equals KO to the third power plus 2CL to the fourth power. CK to the second power? What kind of equation is that? In the more modern lexicon of chemistry, one that has been obsolete for years because the most important ingredient is missing. Unavailable. Distilled essence of scarab lymphs. - Holy corpuscles. -Yes. And this ingredient, combined with other elements in the chemical formula produces a potion capable of paralyzing the human will. Tut could put Gotham City under his power if he can make enough of the stuff. And get it to the populous somehow. - He only has a few resurrected scarabs. -Unfortunately, Robin given the proper climatic conditions, scarabs are able to multiply a thousand fold. - Yes, Alfred? -Just coming to report, sir. The talking sphinx will be on the lawn of Wayne Manor within hours. - Talking sphinx? -If you remember, Robin last year Tut made his royal predictions through the great stone sphinx thus creating terror in this city. Oh, of course. How could I have forgotten? I recently heard that the sphinx was being offered for sale. Sold? Just when I was going to have need of it again. Who purchased my inscrutable lady? Millionaire Bruce Wayne. Yeah, I might have known it. Sheer spite. Just because I kidnapped him last year. What's he planning to do, make a reading lamp out of her? "Mr. Wayne has been quoted as saying he will donate this criminal curiosity to the Black Museum at Scotland Yard. " The Black Museum. Scotland Yard. That's the Hall of Fame. Now I belong to the ages. Just think of it. Cheek to jowl with such great ones of crimes: Landru, Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden. - And the Lavender Hill Mob. -Ha, ha, yes. Now, I need my unfathomable female here and now for my royal predictions. After I'm crowned king of Gotham City, we can think about the Black Museum. Oh, we didn't think of it, Your Kingship. Mister-- I know it, Sethos! But Mr. Bruce Wayne may have second thoughts coming very shortly. When night descends on Wayne Manor, you too will descend and pinch my sphinx. - Shh. Quietly. -There's only one light in the house, upstairs. I don't think anyone's home. Sure. This sphinx pinch is a cinch. Push. Well, Alfred it looks like my young ward and I are going fishing again for the big one. Welcome home, my inscrutable lady. Soon I'll have a new prophecy for you to announce. It's Tut all right, Batman. I think we're in some kind of greenhouse. I know, chum. I've been getting your messages. I've tracked you to the old, abandoned Gizeh Gardens at the corner of Elm and Harvard. I'll see what else I can find out. You may wanna call Commissioner Gordon. Your Majesty. It worked, Your Majesty. The experiment is a success. It worked. Ha-ha-ha! It worked! Praise to the sacred baboons. The cow goddess of Hathor. Osiris, the holy one. Oh, yes, yes. And praise me too. For the first time since the golden age of Ramses Junior there exists the elixir of abu raubu simbu tu. Now may I go back to my apothecary shop? Don't be a booby. There's still work to be done. First, you must crystallize this lovely nectar into a powder and then insert the powder into a capsule. Like so. And you, Cleo, my lovely queen of the Nile in exile you know what to do then, don't you? Yeah, Tut-tut. I slip it to Commissioner Gordon instead of his mid-morning vitamin A. Batman, you better-- That couldn't have made a noise. I haven't hooked up a loud speaker system. Well, I sure heard something, boss, or my name ain't Ameno-- Ooh. Perhaps we should take a look, Your Kingship. The sphinx is hollow, but it may not be empty. Good idea, Royal Lapidary. Release the hidden spring. We've lost him. He must have dropped the Bat-radio. It's sensitive. - Whatever will you do now, sir? -There's always the Bat-geiger Counter. Good. It's picking him up already. How? I planted radioactive Bat-pellets in his belt. Now, if I can just synchronize this miniaturized model with the parent Bat-geiger Counter ah! We should have no trouble finding him. Drag him out. On your knees, Helot. On your knees before the almighty pharaoh. Never. What? Never? You dare to match your will against mine? Give him a shot of your bug juice, boss. That will take the wind out of his sails. Good idea, Tutling. We have need of a guinea pig. Proceed, Royal Apothecary. Get him, get him! Get him. Get him! Watch out for the scarabs! All right, my young testee. It will only sting for a minute. Then your cares will be over forever. No! Holy jawbreaker. I told you, my lovelies, if all went well you'd soon be dining on something better than frogs and fishes. Not much better, granted, but he'll do for a snack. I hope you all have healthy appetites. Eat your din-din. 
NARRATOR". When we last saw the Dynamic Duo The Puzzler had lashed them in the basket of an aerial balloon which would automatically be released and plunge them to their doom when they reached 20,000 feet. How high are they now? In a moment, we shall see. Gosh, Batman, the altimeter reading is 19,000 feet. Oh. Another thousand and the releasing mechanism will drop us like two eggs from a heavenly hen. Yes, it looks hopeless, Robin. - Unless -Unless? Unless that discarded piece of chewing gum that Puzzler's henchman threw in here -Chewing gum? Altimeters work like barometers, Robin but with the principle of air pressure. If you could place the chewing gum over the air hole I see. The pressure will stop and the reading will stay under 20,000. - Correct. - I'll try to get it. Try, Robin. - Try, Robin. -I think I've got it. I've got it. Hurry, Robin, we haven't much time. Right. Be sure to cover it completely. Ah. Just under 20,000. That was a close call, Robin. This will teach that crook to be a litterbug. He should put trash in a proper waste container. Yes. But, gosh, now how do we get down? Holy stratosphere, if we were only birds. - That's it, Robin. -What? We do have a chance. It seems to me that I read in the paper that the elusive and high-flying, giant, red-eyed hermit nuthatch birds are migrating south for the winter. Batman, look. Coming this way. Robin, those bird calls that you were practicing this morning do you have an elusive, high-flying, giant, red-eyed hermit nuthatch bird in your repertoire? Holy Audubon, Batman, I didn't get to that species yet. Couldn't you improvise? That bird, by nature, is a very hostile bird. If you can infuriate him, perhaps he'll attack the balloon. I get it. One or two holes in the balloon and we float smoothly down to earth. I'll sure try. Good boy, Robin, it's working. He did it, Batman. Yes, he did it. He's flying off now. He's had enough hot air. Farewell, feathered friend. Sorry to have disrupted your vacation. We're dropping a lot faster than we went up. The power of gravity, Robin. Not even Puzzler could prevent that. Holy crack-up. I think we can expect a reasonably soft landing. Talk about soft landings. Yes, it was a good one. Any idea where we are? Judging from the terrain and the direction the wind carried us I'd say upstate of Gotham City. I'd say upstate from nowhere. No, our luck seems to be holding out, old chum. Look, as if we ordered it specially. We can thank the taxpayer and Governor Stonefellow for this emergency public telephone. Now to get out of these bonds. Yes, these jewels are lovely but they're not a drop in the bucket compared with what we are really after. The Retsoor is worth a king's ransom. Now, Rocket, you know what you have to do. But this time, please, please be expressive. Ooh. What girl wouldn't be with a bultimillionaire like Artemus Knab who controls just about everything and might make her a movie star? Might make me a movie star. Nothing can stop us now, Puzzler. Oh, nothing. Not even the late Dynamic Duo. By my calculation they should have dropped 20,000 feet from the balloon by now. Not yet, Puzzler. But you're-- You're dead. How puzzling. What on earth could have happened? We'll explain that later, Puzzler, but right now Escape plan number three. Let the heavens open. Oh, imagine me little old Rocket O'Rourke having tea with a great big tycoon like you Arty, baby. Oh, let me pour. I have oodles of talent for pouring tea too. Yes. Well, I would say that you're a very well-rounded young lady, heh with, uh, considerable well-rounded talent. - Oh, flatterer. -Ha-ha-ha-ha. Well, cheers. Oh, yeah. This is a very delicate tea. It's from my own blend of oolong. You see, I have a tea monopoly. Play. Monopol-- Monopoly Phew. Bravo, Rocket, bravo. Well, it worked, Puzzler. But I almost wish it hadn't. He promised me a screen test. Oh, these juggling fiends that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope. Uh, Macbeth. I did my job, Puzzler. Now you do yours. A-okay, Rocket. Onto the deed. Do you know the combination? I haven't been watching every move of Artemus Knab's for the past two weeks for nothing. Yes, by the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. Open locks, whoever knocks! VoilÃ . The camera. Ah. Excellent. Excellent. Well, what I don't understand, Puzzler is if you've already taken pictures of the cockpit, why do you need more? Those pictures of the plane's control panels, plus these pictures of the plane's plans will teach me everything I need to know about flying the Retsoor. Yeah. But I don't think it will help my acting career any when he finds out. The envelope. Don't you think you've left enough clues for today, Puzzler? A crime is nothing without a modus operandi, Rocket. - The envelope. -Tsk. This, plus another little scheme I have in the works should certainly make the Dynamic Duo put on their thinking caps. Careful. I don't hear any ticking. But it could be dangerous. Stand back, everybody. Mother Machree, a rooster! Well, I've had some strange birds in my office in my time, but this is going too far. "Batman, how canst thou keep a rooster from crowing on a Sabbath morn?" - By killing him on a Saturday night. -Tonight is Saturday night. Yes. And I tremble to think of what might occur if we don't piece this cunning puzzle together. Commissioner, have you spoken with Artemus Knab? I haven't been able to reach him. But the desk clerk at the Gotham Arms tells me he hasn't left his penthouse. We were thinking of sending a man over to check. Wait. There's a specific reason why Puzzler wanted to be in business with Knab. Perhaps Knab can provide us with a clue. I suspect this calls for one of our unnoticed arrivals. - Ready for another Bat-climb, Robin? -You bet, Batman. What's wrong, Robin? Tired? Dizzy? I had a strange feeling, Batman. As if-- As if visions of sugarplums were dancing in my head. They should be, Boy Wonder, it's almost Christmas. Ho-ho-ho-ho. Welcome to Gotham City, Mr. Claus. Why, call me Santa Claus, Batman. Everybody else does. Say, you tell me where the Batcave is and I'll leave a little present in your stocking. If you can't trust Santa, whom can you trust? We can't tell you here, Mr. Claus but we'll telephone you at the North Pole on the Batphone. Good, good. I'll get to the Batcave if I have to slide down a Batpole instead of a chimney. Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho-ho. - Merry Christmas, Santa. -Merry Christmas, Santa. Ho-ho-ho. And say hello to those eight reindeer for us. I Will, I Will. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, everybody. Another unannounced intrusion, Batman? We didn't want to attract undue attention, Mr. Knab. We did suspect that you might be in trouble. Trouble? You mean out cold. Some aspiring actress apparently decided that the best way to further her career was to slip a mickey in my oolong. Strange thinking. Do you have any reason to believe that she might be associated with Puzzler? From what I hear of his antics after I launched the Retsoor I wouldn't put anything past Puzzler. Including that note addressed to me and pinned to your lapel? What? Why, the scoundrel! I tried to warn you, Mr. Knab. You did indeed, young man, and I was foolish not to listen. Holy ghost writer. There's nothing on it. Why would he use a pretty girl to drug me to leave a blank piece of paper for you? There are more things in heaven and earth, Artemus that are dreamt of in your philosophy. That's a quote from-- I know. Hamlet. Yes. Well, I can do without any further lines from Shakespeare, Batman. Understandable. Now, this apparently blank piece of paper-- --Seems to have a slight odor of secret writing on it. Of course. I've heard it's one of Puzzler's favorite tricks. What else have you heard, Boy Wonder? Any reason why he would be trying to fleece me? We don't have the answer to that now, Mr. Knab, but we hope to know shortly. If you'll excuse us. We'll take this piece of paper back to the Batcave and analyze it. - I'll come with you. - Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Knab. The location of the Batcave must remain Robin's and my secret alone. Godspeed. Look, the invisible ink is appearing. -"P-U-Z-Z-L-E-S. " -Puzzles? Strange. Nothing more. What could it mean? "Puzzles" has seven letters. What comes in sevens, Robin? - Seven-league boots -Mm. -seven seas -Hm. the dance of the seven veils. It must be something connected with his trying to tell us something. The telephone. The telephone. The average modern telephone number consists of seven digits. Oh. Then matching the digits to the letters, P-U-Z-Z-L-E-S would be seven, eight It doesn't work. There isn't any Z on the dial. Obviously. That's the puzzle. Z is the most enigmatic letter in the alphabet, old chum. Think of the words that begin with Z. Zigzag, zither, zodiac. - Zounds. -Exactly. Zounds is a Shakespearean interjection of wonder or surprise. Apparently, Puzzler expects this puzzle to catch us unprepared. Oh, Which it has. No, Robin. Not entirely. There is a Shakespearean quotation I suspect must be uppermost in Puzzler's mind at this time and which I find quite appropriate. There is a divinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. The Merry Wives of Windsor Act 3, Scene 4, Line 22. Why are odd numbers so appropriate? Some combination of them in the phone dial must be his number. But we know his hideout is in that Globe Balloon Factory. No, I doubt if we could reach him there again, so Divinity in odd numbers. If you can work this, Batman, there must be. Whew What a groovy jumpsuit, Puzzler. One must keep up with the Space Age, Rocket. This is the perfect garb for flying the Retsoor. Now, hurry, boys, the clock abrades me with the waste of time. Speak, knave. Puzzler, this is Batman. As I suspected, Caped Crusader. I'd like to exchange quotations with you, but time is money. So I'll just leave you with this thought: An aviator was carrying his clothes home from the cleaners when it began to rain. How didst he protect them? Holy miracles, Batman. You got his number on your first try. Now, an aviator was carrying his clothes home from the cleaners when it began to rain. Gosh, that's a tough one. Yes. First, a puzzle dealing with roosters and now this. Looks like we're flying blind, Batman. Flying. Flying? Don't you know how the aviator protected the clothes he was carrying? He put them inside the hangars. Hangar. That can only mean-- Artemus Knab's airplane, Retsoor. Rooster spelled backwards. And this scheme could've been under our noses all the time. To the Batmobile. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, back in the abandoned shed the Puzzler has set up a magic lantern show. Considering the haste with which I made these microfilm photos of Artemus Knab's secret plans, I'd say the photography is not too bad. You're a genius, chief. Oh, no time for accolades, Ramjet. Now that I've solved all of Retsoor's secrets, flying her should be a soft and gentle breeze. The plane's fueled up and ready to go, but they left two guards in front. Fret not, Blimpy, they don't even know we've found this shed or that it connects with the hangar. Rocket, go outside and create your usual diversion. Oh. Sure thing, Puzzler. Mm Six million dollars' worth of machinery. And we make the killing tonight. How unbearably scrumptious. Gonna sell it to a foreign government? Have you taken leave of your senses, Glider? I may be an archvillain but I'm a 100-percent naturalized American archvillain. No one gets his hands on that plane except Artemus Knab after he's, uh, paid me a small ransom of, say, um, $4 million. Parting is such sweet sorrow. My heart is always heavy when a caper finally comes to an end but end it must. All right, men, to my work. Follow me. Her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light. - But where are we going? -To some neutral country from which I can negotiate with Artemus Knab. - Do we need passports and stuff? -The Retsoor is all the passport we need. - Ah. Heh-heh-heh. Boy, I should get an Academy Award for that act. I just told the guards that I ran out of gas down the road and I left two of my girlfriends in it. Then the guards are gone? Like the wind. I told them my girlfriends were cold and lonely. Good thinking, Rocket. Blimpy, open the hangar door. Aboard, aboard. My puzzles have done a lot of outpuzzling. But this is the first time I've outpuzzled an airplane's control panel puzzle. Egad, what was that? Where's Blimpy? It is shut again. Hm? Yes, Puzzler, shut again. And will remain shut until you and your high-flying flunkies are floored forever. Cleverer than I thought, Caped Crusaders, but I still mean to launch the Retsoor. You mean hijack it. A mere matter of semantics, Boy Wonder. Lights, camera, action. Zounds. No, Puzzler. Leaving out the semantics, you're about to be launched off to prison. I suspect the authorities should be arriving shortly. Your suspicion is correct, Batman. Good thing you called from the Batmobile. We'd have been here sooner, but Grand Avenue is all torn up. May I present the infamous Puzzler, gentlemen. He's in your charge now, also this young lady. But all I ever wanted to be was a movie star. Opportunities like that don't come often, Miss O'Rourke, and must be earned. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Too many puzzles. Is that what did it, Batman? One too many. Quantity finally exceeded quality, Puzzler. And all those quotes of Shakespeare didn't help either. My soul is full of discord and dismay. - Hamlet. -Act 4. - Scene 1. -Line 46. Forty-five. Egad, sir, you're right. Well What's going on here? Bruce and Dick, aren't these the cutest puzzle balloons you've ever seen? Yes, they're very unusual. Some balloon factory was going out of business and Alfred was able to get the exact ones I need for a party I'm giving for underprivileged children. My pleasure, madam. They really are quite a novelty, aren't they? Verily, Aunt Harriet, quite a novelty. - Well, all's well that-- -That ends well, sir? Well 
NARRATOR". Mount Ararat Hospital in Gotham City where King Tut's psychoanalysis goes on and on. The old adage about the apple not falling far from the tree just ain't necessarily so. How? Dr. Demon. Dr. Demon'? Spunky? Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop When the wind Dirty asp in the grass. He locked it. So I said to Daddy, "But I'm too young to get married, Pa. I'm only 12 years old. " You know, I always had a feeling you never really listened to me. Con-- Continue. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at the offices of the Rosetta Stone Company Why me? Why me? Why not you? - That's logical. -I'm nothing if not logical. Take only $47,000, Tutlings. But there's 76,000, poopsie. No need to be a pig about these things. We have the money, almighty king of rogues. Master of Thebes. Ruler of darkness. Defender of Egypt. Don Juan of AswÃ¢n. - King of the Nile. -Wait a minute. Take it back one. - Don Juan of Aswan? -Yeah, I like that. Leave it in. Ha, ha. Yes? Oh, hello, Dr. Denton. What? King Tut? Yes. Yes, of course. I'll contact him at once. What a shame. At last report, our able Yale professor was well on his way to recovery. Another six or seven months of intensive analysis and he might have been completely cured. Ah, yes, but as John Greenleaf Whittier said: "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: 'It might have been. "' "Maud Muller," stanza 53. Very good, Robin. I didn't know you were a student of the classics. Batman teaches me a little poetry in between remanding criminals to jail. Enough prose and cons, Robin. Now, where can we find Rosetta Stone? Resting comfortably at home: I trust a visit from us wouldn't be too upsetting. She's expecting you, Batman. Ah, good. Let's go, Robin. Hi-ho. So you made up your mind, Daddy. You'd really like to move to the suburbs. Heh. It might be a pleasant change from my old brownstone. If I only had time to find a place. Oh, my. Well, if I get a chance today, I'll check with a real estate broker or two for you, okay? Thank you, darling. - Bye, Daddy. Bye, Chief O'Hara. -Bye-bye. NARRATOR". Shortly, at Florence of Arabia's, an intime boÃ®te in the middle east side of Gotham City Ah, turkey legs. My favorite fruit. Florence, a little more pressed grape, if you please. Oh, I'm sorry, poopsie. I guess I got a little carried away. No matter, Flo. Your assets far outnumber your liabilities. Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt. - Why don't you go on a diet, fatty? -"Why don't you go on a diet?" Why don't you mind your own skinny business? Now, being Egyptian naturally, I have a nose for Nilanium. Nilanium, the hardest metal in the world. It was once found only in the Nile Basin. But when that was flooded by the AswÃ¢n Dam, this precious deposit was lost forever. So forever is something you can't do much about, huh, poopsie? Wrong again, Florence. My nose for Nilanium tells me that there is another invaluable deposit right here in Gotham City. Right where in Gotham City? Unfortunately, said reserves rest directly under stately Wayne Manor. Wayne Manor? Ancestral home of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson. But you can't buy that for 47,000. But I can and will buy some land directly adjacent to the estate for that exact sum. And once that's done, we'll start drilling for my Nilanium and make a fortune. - How? -By making the hardest objects in the world out of the hardest metal. Indestructible machines, indestructible buildings. I'll build an indestructible empire that no one will be able to destruct! But isn't that Nilanium really the property of millionaire Bruce Wayne? Yeah, it would have to be under his property. Money goes to money. But not this money. We're going to engage in a bit of slant mining. Where to, almighty monarch? To the office of Manny the Mesopotamian an unscrupulous real estate broker of my acquaintance and by merest circumstance the man who has the listing on the property next to Wayne Manor. Forty-seven thousand dollars, sir? But isn't that rather an odd sum for King Tut to take? Yes, it is, Alfred. Rosetta Stone told us that Tut didn't wanna be a pig about it. Bacon. Pig. It's against Egyptian dietary laws to eat pig. Ergo, I think it was a ruse on his part to obscure the truth. Well, what is the truth, Batman? Perhaps he intends buying something that costs exactly $47,000. Let's see what the Batcomputer has to offer. - It seems a little uncertain, Batman. -Certainly does. No wonder. "Northeast section of millionaire Bruce Wayne's property. " The Batcomputer said that? But that's only partly right, Alfred. I have put a 200-foot lot up for sale on the edge of stately Wayne Manor estate to help alleviate the property shortage. - Jolly decent of you, sir. - Yeah. But I gave the real estate broker specific instructions to ask for a firm $48,000, not $47,000. This machine needs oiling. How much do you have to spend, Ms. Gordon? Well, actually, it isn't me, it's my father, Mr. , uh Just call me Manny. Everybody does. That's my name, Manny. Well, my father is tired of city congestion and thought he might make a good deal here. Well, frankly, Ms. Gordon, if I were your father, I'd just forget about this area entirely. Why, this afternoon, I have a deal where I'm selling a lot without a house for $47,000. - Is that the one? "Lot, $48,000 firm"? -Yes. - I'm cutting my commission to make the deal. -Is that legal? Well, legal, yes, ethical, no, but nobody ever accused me of being ethical. Well, thank you very much. I'll call my father. Good day, Ms. Gordon. Salaam yourself, Manny. No time for pleasantries. - You have the contract? -I have the contract. - You have the money? -Give him the money. Thank you very much. Just sign right there. That's it. Right there. That's right. - What? No middle initial? -I never use it. Heh. That's what I like about you fellas. No haggling. Hello, Mr. Wayne? This is Batgirl. Why, hello, Batgirl. To what do I owe this unexpected honor? I've discovered that King Tut has purchased a plot of land adjacent to your property, Mr. Wayne. King Tut? Well, that should make a very interesting neighborhood probably drive the real estate values straight down. I'm sure he has some diabolical scheme in mind. I thought you should be made aware of it. I'm going to try and contact Batman now. I may be talking to him shortly myself, Batgirl. Perhaps I can give him a message for you. Yes. Tell him I'll be in Commissioner Gordon's office in half an hour. Perhaps we should meet and plan a joint attack. Right. Thanks for the information. Of what possible use could that land be to a man like Tut? Maybe he wants to just settle down and build a house. No, I think not, Robin. Tut doesn't impress me as the be-it-ever-so-humble- there-is-no-place-like-home type of individual. What is it, Batman? A potpourri of news, Robin, both good and bad. What's the good news? Stately Wayne Manor is sitting on a priceless reserve of Nilanium. Holy hardest metal in the world. But what's the bad news? The special seismological attachment to the Batcomputer has divined that King Tut has started mining Nilanium and his mining operations are aimed-- Is it possible? - His mining operations are aimed-- -Into what, Batman? Directly into the Batcave. It's no use, Robin. His shaft is more than halfway here and should be entering the Batcave shortly. Isn't there anything we can do to divert them so they'd miss the Batcave? The Batanium Shield lining the Batcave might protect us from his blasting, but I doubt it. No, we'll have to go topside and nab him before he strikes pay dirt. Nab him where? I suspect he may be operating from an abandoned mine on that property he bought. Aren't we gonna take the Batmobile? It's too risky. There's so many people in the area, they might spot us as we drive out the secret entrance. No, we'll use the subterranean blue grotto exit after I make this call. Yes, Batman? Right. As we hoped, it's for you, Batgirl. Yes, Batman? There's a deserted mine entrance one mile north-northeast of stately Wayne Manor. - Could you meet us there? -Anything wrong? - Everything's wrong. - I'll be there as soon as possible. What now, Batman? According to my Bat-compass north by northeast is in a general north-northeasterly direction. Shouldn't take us more than three minutes to run the mile. Gosh, Batman, that's a new world's record. Breaking world's records is just part of crime-fighting, Robin. Now. NARRATOR". But will they be too late? For at this very moment outside the abandoned cave from which Tut is operating How much longer do you think it'll take, royal geologist? Well-- How come he gets to be royal haggler and royal tailor and royal geologist too? We're working on a close budget, royal boobula. When we strike Nilanium I'll have enough scratch to hire a complete royal entourage. We should be there right about now. Oh. Here comes H. L. Hunter, the royal mining foreman. What ho, H. L. ? Strike anything? You know, we done struck something, but it weren't no Nilanium. - I think we done struck trouble. -Why? Well, it seems that there's a big cave directly beneath Wayne Manor. It's lined with some hard substance, so we can't blast through it. Perhaps we've struck a vein of Nilanium. But it shouldn't be that hard till it's refined. - Do you have any more dynamite? -Sure, but we got no one to blast it. None of my men wanna take the chance. It's sort of dangerous. I'll do it. Danger is my middle name. Show me the way. You aren't going anywhere, Tut. Ah, look who's here, the Dynamic Dullards. Plus one. Oh, and the Dynamic Duenna. Instruct your royal yeggs to come quietly, or you'll incur our wrath. Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin. Come on, boys. We've got too much to lose. I didn't know we're doing anything illegal. Mining into and under other people's property is not illegal? - Not when you're slant drilling for oil. - Which you were not. It's obvious that you're an innocent miner. All right, you may go. Whoa, whoa. - But this will take us to the bottom of the shaft. -That's better than facing the Tawdry Trio. Mush! - They must have gone down. -Holy journey to center of the Earth. - They won't stop until they-- -Bottom. Until they reach the bottom. But where is the bottom? Batgirl, you stand guard in case they come back up. This time, we're gonna have to make the two-minute mark in the mile, Robin. Let's go. Oh! Oh, do my old eyes deceive me? Oh, happiness unbounded. Oh, great blobs of joy. Eureka! I have found it. The Batcave. Right under Wayne Manor. Oh, dream of ha-- Right under Wayne Manor? That means that they're-- Carry the three-- That means Robin and Batman are really Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. Oh, the world is my oyster. And everyone will be bringing me sauce. A little winded, old chum? It takes more than a two-minute mile to make me winded, Batman. Oh! Ah! Yeesh! Oh, how time flies when you're having fun. Ha-ha-ha! - What will we do about that? - Yeah. Yeah. It's always darkest before the dawn, Robin. I know, I know, and a rolling stone gathers no moss. And we shouldn't cry over spilt milk. Or waste time with old clichÃ©s. - Where is everybody, Batgirl? - I'm here. Well, he means Batman, Robin and King Tut. Oh, they've all gone on a journey to the center of the Earth or something. The center of what? Oh, Florence, the fruits of victory are sweet indeed. Maybe, Tut, but you'll still choke on them. From the mouths of babes ofttimes comes pap. - Are you ready to give yourselves up? -Not to you, Bat-dope or your 97-pound weakling bird boy. And where's your feminine friend? Don't want her to know you're really Bruce Wayne, do you? Well, soon the world will know. You'll have to kill us to keep our mouths shut. Tutlings, follow me. I'll give them Batnesia Gas, Robin. Tell Alfred take them topside and deposit them on the lawn. They won't remember a thing. Roger. What about me, Batman? You'll have to kill me to keep me quiet. No, I won't. King Tut ran up the shaft. He moves quickly for an overstuffed and unlikely Egyptian pharaoh. We must catch him before he reaches the end of the shaft. Ah, drat, we're out of Batnesia Gas. Now we really must catch Tut before he reaches the end of the shaft. Are you ready to be incarcerated, King Tut? With the greatest pleasure. You could jail me for a million years and I wouldn't flinch an inch. Oh, at last, nirvana is within my grasp. You appear to be breezy for a man about to be tucked away. I know. And so would you if you knew what I know. And if I know you, no doubt you know what I know now, no, huh? Why waste time with someone who knows? Gotta find someone who doesn't. You know? - No. -Sounds like the riddle of the sphinx. Nothing so simple as that, dear lady. I hold the key to the riddle of the ages. You're too late, Dynamic Dimwits. Holy waste of energy. - What has he told you? -Nothing. He's been running off at the mouth about some secret or riddle. The beans, so to speak, are about to be spilled. Batman and Robin, prepare to meet the end of your usefulness. Lady and gentlemen, Batman and Robin are-- It's only gonna prolong the agony, Batman. Not necessarily, Robin. That blow on his head could be exactly what saves us. I certainly hope so. Where am I? You were about to tell us a secret, King Tut. King Tut? My name is William Omaha McElroy and I'm professor of Egyptology at Yale University. You don't remember what you were going to tell us? Why do you have a purple mask on, lady? I'm going to be late for class. - Uh, just a moment, professor. -You can't walk off like this. Harvard people, nice speaking to you. Holy razor's edge. Was that a close shave. A calculated risk, Robin. The shale held up by those sagging timbers has been shifting for decades. All we had to do was taunt Tut with our silence. This caused him to raise his voice three decibels above high C which caused the cave-in, which, of course, returned him to normalcy. But how could you be so sure? I really couldn't, Robin. Earth movement is an inexact science at best. Matter of fact, yodels have been known to cause avalanches in the Alps. A mere sneeze was the cause of the 1923 Appalachian cave-in. But suppose something went wrong. Suppose Tut didn't raise his voice. What then? I prefer not to think about those things, Robin. They depress me. Thank you, sir, for calling. That was the president of Yale University, Chief O'Hara. Our eminent professor of Egyptology has completely returned to normal. Mm. Let's hope his ego has returned to the altar in ancient Egypt. Daddy, have you heard the latest rumors? All of Gotham City is buzzing about an imminent invasion of flying saucers. Well, now Gotham City is usually buzzing about something, Barbara. - Well, let's take a look anyway, commissioner. -All right. Let me have those. Well, now, let's see. Uh-huh. All I can see is sky, clouds and a few birds. - Let's see what you can find, chief. - Hmm. Well, there's a blimp trailing some joker's used-car advertisements. NARRATOR". Look again. In this flying saucer the Joker is planning an incredible invasion of Gotham City. As soon as the range-sweep radar scanner picks up the tracking pulse amplifier we will spin back into the substratosphere, where I will issue my demands that will have not only all of Gotham City but the world at my feet. 
NARRATOR". When last we saw the Dynamic Duo Robin was in for a wax job. And Batman was about to be skeletonized by the Joker's Human Key Duplicator. Sad to say, nothing has changed. Sorry to leave you, Batman, at this key point in your life but I have other more important things to tend to than my humdrum locksmith activities. Heh-heh. The actual skeletonizing process will begin shortly. When it's over, and the Boy Wonder is properly waxed let me know. Turn the spray on full. This joke of the Joker's don't strike me as being funny. What if we get caught? We won't, Latch. Think of all we owe the Joker, the fine things he's done for us. Sneaking those files into the prison dumping our parole officer in the Gotham River kidnapping that entire jury and holding the judge's wife as hostage. He's been a real friend. You're right, Bolt. There should be more fine, upstanding men like the Joker. Look, a living Bat skeleton. I am not one given to trite sayings, Robin but I'd say I got you out of that Spray Wax Chamber in the nick of time. Thanks to those underwater swimming lessons I could've held my breath a while longer. How did you get out of that fiendish Key Duplicator, Batman? I jammed the machinery with a simple house key that I carry in my utility belt in case we're locked out. When the cutting blade retracted, device automatically opened. The Joker was none too sophisticated with his brilliant changes and innovations. A good lesson, Robin: always carry an extra key. I'd say you were both lucky to be still alive. And stupid to have walked into that trap in the first place. Without danger, the game grows cold. Little is gained without risk. True, indeed, sir. Now, uh, if I may be permitted Mrs. Cooper has invited her whist group to lunch. - I promised I'd serve it punctually at 1, sir. -Of course, Alfred. Anyway, at least we know where the Joker's hideout is, Batman. I hardly think that Mr. Clavier Ankh and his crafty cohorts will be found at that address, Robin. What do we do? Like Mohammed, we must wait until the mountain comes to us again. Still alive? How can they be? Well, Batman is, that's for sure. Oh, well, I might as well be philosophical about it. Regardless of how clever the Dynamic Duo are their hours are measured. In fact, I'm measuring them right now with this time machine. I found a wrinkle. Ah. You're worried about wrinkles, Cornelia when I have just rebuilt and refined my magic box so that when I turn this key I can turn time either backward or forward or stop it completely. Ha-ha-ha! - Will your gadget work anyplace, boss? -Anyplace and on anything or anybody. For instance, somewhere in Gotham City right now the sidewalks are crowded and the traffic is busy. Now, see what happens when I turn this key and time moves a bit faster. And faster and faster and faster. Then if I stop time and start it again, very slowly or even move it backwards slowly. Let's try the Gotham Airport or the Gotham Ballpark or the handsome residence of millionaire Bruce Wayne. You know, I never go inside Bruce's study. But as long as I'm taking you girls on a tour of the house, we'll just Or even Commissioner Gordon's office. Heh-heh. Ha, ha! - Don't stop now, boss. -Yeah, try it on Batman and Robin. That's what I plan to do. But I want to meet them face-to-face. I want to see the results myself. Heh-heh-heh. Did you make this one out of cheese parings and lightning bugs too, Joker? Uh, no, Cornelia. My newest triumph is composed of much more complicated parts: human frailties, the power of mass suggestion catalytic agents, unexplained phenomena. Gee, all that in one box, boss? Plus two added components, Latch. - A pellet and a pond. -A what and a which? Ingredients which must remain secret for the nuns, Cornelia. But they did their work today. Ha-ha-ha! What's next, boss? Next, Bolt, to stop time throughout Gotham City unless the city fathers meet my demands. You're so forceful when you demand things from fathers, Joker. - What is it this time? -A mere $10 million, Cornelia. Ha-ha-ha! But first a moment to catch my breath. While another message I sent is being delivered about the time I imagine the Dynamic Duo are getting an emergency call. Yes, commissioner. I would've phoned you sooner, but I had nothing to report. Well, I have something to report, Batman. Our beloved metropolis seems to be in the grip of a strange spell. Someone, and we suspect the Joker again, is playing a devious trick with time turning it backward, forward, faster, slower. Sounds like he's improved on that magic box of his. Which could spell disaster. And there's an envelope for you here, Batman. It's shaped in the form of a key. Better open it and read me the message. Time may be of the essence. We can't afford to be wrong about this message, Robin. That's just the way Commissioner Gordon read it over the phone. "Thanks to the work of a single sphere, you saw what happened to time right here. " I just may be onto something. "Now, regard with care, my final O-HO. " "0-HO. " What does "O-HO" mean to you, Robin? Well, it's a word composed of two O's and one H. - Mm-hmm. -Holy hydraulics. H2O, the chemical symbol for water. I am onto something. Now, the last line. "I've a gargoyle's key and away I 90-90" Can you figure out those two words: "gargoyle's key"? I know gargoyles are grotesque figures that decorate some of Europe's old churches. I see. And their original functions their meanings, Robin, were water spouts drains, funnels, throughways Then a gargoyle's key could also be the key to a waterworks. Yes, and that all ties into the first sentence. "Thanks to the work of a single sphere. " "Sphere. " A ball is a sphere. A marble a pebble, pill. A pill. The Joker could have gotten the key to the waterworks and polluted Gotham City's water. I've heard that a character resembling the Joker was seen by a waterworks guard near the storage reservoir a night or so ago. - Holy floodgate. -Yes, Robin. He may have started his job with one pill. And now he's off to finish that job. As insidious a scheme as could be imagined. Extortion via time. - We better get to the waterworks. -If I may, sir? I didn't want to interrupt, but I heard the whole thing. And I just can't let you and Master Robin run the risk really, sir. - Let me go. -You, Alfred? Yes. Mrs. Cooper's whist group left and she's gone to the theater. In an hour, it will be dark, I shall have no difficulty in getting into the waterworks. My cousin Egbert is night watchman there. Remember Eggie, sir? As president of the Water Commission, you helped him get his job. Now, it's more than likely that he's the man who saw the Joker and-- I seldom ask a favor, sir, but I do ask this one. You see, I'd like to feel that I'm not only contributing my bit. I like to feel that I'm part of the team, sir. - Well spoken, Alfred. -Of course, you're part of the team. Then you will, sir, let me replace you in this crafty charade? Not exactly replace us, Alfred. But it might not be a bad idea for you to replace your cousin in the security room. That way, Robin and I could stake out the storage reservoir and be nearby and on the alert. Hoping you'd say that, sir. I, uh, brought my wheels, for want of a better word, with me and with no intention of infringement, sir I call it my Alf-Cycle. I have my Two-way Alf-radio between the handlebars. And, uh, I took the liberty of making the necessary adjustments on the Batmobile unit. Good thinking, Alfred. Well, arrivederci. - Me, Egbert? -Yeah, you. I should've made you stay out at the visitor's vestibule. We got a rule around here. Nobody allowed in this room except the authorized personnel. That means me. Who knows but that some misguided soul might try to slip in and pollute the city's water supply. Yeah. The other night, I caught some joker in the storage reservoir and threw him out. A wise move indeed. But I'm not here to upset security, Eggie, I'm here to relieve you. Millionaire Bruce Wayne, for whom, as you know, I butle and a very influential gentleman with city government fears you may be overworked. He ain't just talking. He suggested that I replace you on your shift tonight and, uh, give you a bit of a breather. I sure could use it. And I know just the bit. Bubbles LaBlue at The Follies. That chick swings like a king's playground. We're just about the same size, Eggie. I'm sure your uniform would fit me. Yeah, take off them specs, and we do look a little alike. Next guard comes on duty at 4 a. m. Can't see too good. Play it straight and he'll think you's me. Don't worry, Eggie. Any particular instructions? Ah. All the watchmen has to do on this job is watch. Now, that ain't too hard. If you should happen to run into Tassles Laverne at The Follies say hello to her from me. What am I doing here, Joker? A vent shaft in the waterworks? I wanted you here on the kill, Cornelia. This little caper is my trump card, my coup d'Ã©tat. Got something to do with your box and key, Joker? And the bullets and the palms, or whatever you said? Ah, pellets and pond, Cornelia. More simply, these pills and these waterworks. -Those are pills? Oh, the chemist was in a whimsical mood when he filled the prescription. But by dissolving my key-shaped capsule in the main reservoir and then resorting to the powers of my magic box and key I shall forever control the matter of time in Gotham City and thus my odious adversaries, the Dynamic Duo. Don't forget those fathers, Joker, and all that mere dough. Oh. Never fear, Cornelia. If you're gonna toss pills in water, why don't we climb over the fence? Too dangerous, Bolt. Very tight security in here. Except for that guard in there. He can be bought. Who wants to buy an old goat like that? Oh, Cornelia, he's on the take. Fixable. Oh. This grill lifts easily. Latch, Bolt. Careful now. Quietly, quietly. Who goes there? I mean, here? Oh, good evening, friend. You were sleeping so soundly I hoped not to disturb you. How did you get in here? See that notice? We got a rule around here. I know, but you were so courteous to me the other evening near the storage reservoir. Courteous, sir? I threw you out. Uh, the old fellow seems a bit befuddled. Oh, this might help you recollect. Add it to the fiver I gave you last time. Eggie. Bribed. What? I got a frog kicking around my tonsils. Well, a cup of nice fresh water should fix that. There you are. I hate to drink alone. Oh, I'll join you, Daddy-o. There are no mirrors around here. No mirrors make me thirsty. - No, no, Cornelia. -You heard the lady, give her a drink. And give that shifty-looking stooge one and that greasy goon. While you're at it, have a big slug on me. - Oh-- - Ay-yi-yi. I ain't just talking, brother. Now drink. And now I'll take that box of yours. - No. -Come on, hand it over. This iron box, real bullets? Hurry. Come on. Well, Joker, I guess this is the end of you and your gargoyle's KEY- Gargoyle's key? You're no security guard. You must be working with Batman and Robin. Come on, Daddy-o, give little old Cornelia that silly old box. Mommy. My word. A bit too much. Ah. A truly remarkable contraption. Stay right there. Batman. Batman. - Alfred here. - I read you, over. The Joker and his cohorts are, so to speak, on ice. At least I've managed to freeze them in time with the help of his unique invention. Good going, Alfred. We'll be right there. Thank you, sir. What happened, boss? Obviously the stupid fool removed the key from my magic box. Let's get him before he discovers his mistake. All right, hand over that box. I said, give me that box! Just a moment, Joker. You needn't be so vociferous. My hearing is unimpaired. Vociferous? Unimpaired? Ha! Now I know you're no security guard. Jumping to another conclusion, Joker? Get the box from the old geezer. It's my last chance. You said you wanted me on the kill, I didn't know you were this serious. Your little game is over, Joker. Robin, take him to the Batmobile while I clean up the rest of this debris. Right. If you wanna pollute any more water you'll find plenty where you're going, up the river. I hate to bother you, young man but I was returning home from town and I ran out of gas a little way down the road. Uh-- Alfred. - What are you doing here in that getup? -Huh? I'm Mrs. Harriet Cooper of stately Wayne Manor and you're our butler, Alfred. Sorry, baby. My name's Eggie. I'm the night security man. Well, the resemblance is absolutely uncanny. Anyway, may I use your phone to call a cab? Phone? Oh, yes, yes. Here, here. - Come in, sugar. On the wall there. -Thank you. If I can just find a dime now. - We brought you a midnight snack-- -Shh. Batman and Robin. Good evening, Mrs. Cooper. What a strange place to find you. Well, I was just telling this gentleman who looks exactly like the Wayne butler that I ran out of gas about a block down the road and-- We always carry an extra supply in the Batmobile. Robin? - This way, Mrs. Cooper. -Oh, thank you, Batman. The spitting image. Phew. That was a close shave, sir. But you handled it with your usual finesse, Alfred. At least that mischief maker and his mangy militia won't be bothering us for some time. -Excellent, sir. But one thing concerns me. He still has some of those gargoyle keys in his possession. No, no, he was relieved of them. And we received the lab report. Somehow he'd concocted a drug which produced a mass hallucinatory effect when dissolved in water and activated by some key force. - The key to the magic box? But how? -Ah. How could it have turned time backwards, forwards faster and slower? How little do we know of time, Alfred. A one-syllable word, a noun yesterday's laughter, tomorrow's tears 
It's 7:00 in the morning and Gotham City is rubbing the sleep out of its eyes preparing to meet the new day. But in the studios of KGC-TV Harry Upps has his morning show already in progress. And one of the primary functions of the Wayne Foundation Fund is to support and supplement local recreational activities. We believe that through physical fitness and organized sport we can help the youth of Gotham City help themselves. That's very admirable, Mr. Wayne. Your foundation is doing marvelous work. Now, if you'll pardon me for just 60 seconds. - A word from the sponsor? -Exactly. There wouldn't be a highly-rated Harry Upps Morning Show without the sponsors. Friends, the rainy season is almost upon us and if you ever get caught in the downpour just reach for a Stay-Dry Umbrella. Stay-Dry has been making umbrellas for 64 years now. I, um-- I know that it's supposed to be bad luck to open an umbrella indoors but, heh, heh, I'll take that chance because I'd like you to see the beautiful workmanship that goes into this Stay-Dry Umbrella. Please note the-- Looks like Harry Upps has lost his voice. This may be the work of one of our archenemies. But which one? An umbrella usually means the Penguin's waddling around somewhere. And this is a riddle: "What's black and white and full of fuzz?" - Zebra, zebra, zebra? -No, a squad car. Yes, speaking of squad cars Commissioner Gordon always watches this program. He should be calling us any second. Are we on the air? Due to circumstances beyond anyone's control we now switch you to our midday movie: The Big Green Thing That Devoured Pittsburgh. I'm sorry, sir, he's not here at the moment. Uh, taking his morning constitutional, I fancy. Oh, begging your pardon, sir, here is Batman now. Yes, you're calling about what happened on the morning show. - Why, yes, how did you know? - I viewed the entire affair. A criminal has to get up pretty early in the morning to outwit you, Batman. Check on the location of Joker, Riddler and Penguin. We'll meet you in your office as soon as possible. To the Batpoles. It's really an ordinary umbrella with a mild electric shock device build into the handle. Hardly enough to cause a man to lose his speech. Well, he's not in any pain, but he can't say a word for the life of him. A serious detriment for an announcer. Poor man has been checked from toenails to tonsils but all to no avail. I think we should concentrate on who did it rather than how it was done. Commissioner, did you follow my suggestion? Indeed, Batman, but the Joker, the Riddler and the Penguin are all three in jail. - Wasn't any of them. -Hm. May we take this with us? Of course, by all means. Perhaps one of the instruments in the Batcave may be able to shed some light on this baffling puzzle. It's our only clue. Let's go, Robin. I don't believe there ever have been or ever will be two such selfless people. Well, they've certainly made my job a whole lot easier, commissioner. And mine. I think if I were to ask Batman would give me the cape right off his back. What a man. Yes, Bonnie? Oh, by all means, yes, send her in. Hello, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara. Catwoman. Hello, hello, hello. - Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Eenie. -Hi, commish. - Meanie, Miney and Moe. -We're pleased to meet you. - Commissioner Gordon. -And Chief O'Hara. I'm delighted to learn of your new venture into the world of show business. - Oh, yes, and, you know -Ha, ha. it's so much safer on this side of the law. Show business is such a rewarding profession. Ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha. Tell me, what do you call yourselves? Catwoman and the Kittens. Ha, ha! Catchy. - Don't you think? -Oh, yes, yes, quite. We'd love to have you perform at the Police Benevolent Society Ball. Will you? With the greatest of pleasure, it'll be our debut. We'll put on a performance you'll never forget. I categorically promise you that. Tell me, do Batman and Robin know I've been sprung? Oh, dear, I had intended telling them but it completely slipped my mind in the throes of this morning's incidents. Well, do me a favor, commissioner. Let it be our secret for the nonce. Meow. Batman will learn about it soon enough. Come on, kittens. Goodbye, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara. Until we meet again. Here's a kiss to build a dream on. I just don't know, commissioner what with her being back in town and all that commotion this morning. Do you suppose she could be the cause of it? Oh, nonsense, Chief O'Hara, I can tell a reformed woman when I see one. And there is a reformed woman. NARRATOR". And in Catwoman's lair adjoining Duncan's Dance Studio Yeow! Isn't it simply too delicious for words? Ha, ha. Do you really think we'll be able to get away with it? Of course we will. Didn't I snatch that silly announcer's voice this morning without a hitch? Eenie, get me his voice. I'll take that chance because I would like you to see the beautiful workmanship that goes into this Stay-Dry Umbrella. Please note the-- So where did it get us? You risked getting caught just to pull a prank. Prank? Eenie, sometimes I think you left your brain in San Francisco. I did it to take suspicion away from us. And set the wheels of justice skidding in the wrong direction. Ha-ha-ha. When we complete this caper we're gonna have enough money to keep us in catnip forever. Or else I'm gonna give the whole world a severe case of permanent laryngitis. Fellas, are you sure that article didn't mention where they're staying? -"The popular singing duo--" -"Chad and Jeremy--" "Are coming to Gotham City to appear at the Police Society Ball. " "Due to anticipated rush of their fans--" "Accommodations for Chad and Jeremy are being kept secret. " Get the commissioner on the phone. Are you nuts? You ask him anything, he'll suspect you for sure. Let's get something straight. Catwoman is top dog around here and let's not forget it, Eenie. Hello, Catwoman, what can I do for you? You can tell me where Chad and Jeremy are staying while they're here in Gotham City. Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that. It's top-secret information, very hush-hush. You don't trust me? I'm deeply hurt. I thought you, of all people, would give solace to an ex-convict. Is there any particular reason you want to know? I wanna make certain we won't perform any of the same songs they will. You want this show to be a success, don't you? Well, since you put it that way. They'll be at the home of millionaire Bruce Wayne, stately Wayne Manor. But look: You must promise not to divulge this information to anyone. I give you my word as a lady and a scholar. Tell me, commissioner they call you the voice of authority in Gotham City, do they not? At times, yes, yes, why do you ask? And if you couldn't speak, it might severely cripple your effectiveness, would it not? - What do you mean? -Just say bye-bye, commissioner. No more pompous prattle from you. Hello? You can win a free dance lesson at the Duncan Dance Studios if you answer this simple question. - Sorry, I'm not interested in dance lessons. -Wait a minute, Dick. The junior prom's coming up, isn't it? - Yes, but-- -We don't want you to be a Wallflower, do we? Dancing is an integral part of every young man's education. Gosh, Bruce, you're right, but dancing? - All right, miss, what's the question? - Who painted Whistler's Mother? Why, Whistler, of course. Congratulations. - You mean, that's it? -That's it. - When do I get my lesson? -I'll be right over. Can you imagine that? First time in my life I ever won anything. Heh. Congratulations. I have to go to the store to pick up a tube for the Bat-sound analyzer we can't make a move without it. Back in a hour. Okay. - One, two, three. - Ow. Sorry. You'll get the hang of it. You're doing just fine, fine. I don't think I'll ever learn to dance, Ms. Klutz. I don't have natural rhythm. Balderdash. Ha, ha. You'll pardon the expression, now I'm a little out of breath. Could we take a break? Certainly. Very nice place you have here, Master Grayson. Very homey. Fourteen bathrooms, 18 bedrooms. - How many entrances are there to the place? -Three. Why are you asking all these questions about the house? You seem more interested in the layout of Wayne Manor than giving me a dancing lesson. When I get through with you, Master Grayson I'll have taught you one heck of a lesson. What are those things there? - Dogwood, why? -Dog--? I am allergic to-- Why, you're no dance teacher, you're Catwoman. Oh! Mercy me. NARRATOR". And at Gotham City Airport England's singing sensations, Chad and Jeremy, are due to arrive. - Have no fear. -Chad and Jeremy are here. Oh, aren't they just the most adorable twosome in the world? If you don't count Batman and Robin. - What do you think of the States so far? - Do us a favor, we've been here two minutes. And sometimes it takes us as long as half an hour to get to really know a country. - About that haircut of yours, Jeremy. - What haircut? I haven't had a trim in weeks. Actually, he wears it that way so people won't confuse him with his mom. Yeah, she's bald, poor thing. - Is that right? - Yeah, that's right. What are your plans after your appearance in Gotham City? We're going straight back home. We've gotta do a command performance for the queen. Respect In hating an enemy Catwoman. It's nice to see a responsible citizen like you for a change. Thank you, sergeant. Am I a living symbol of your youth? Come on, kittens, let's get out of here. Too many bluecoats for us to get away with it. Get away with what, Catwoman? - We still don't know your plan. -You will, Eenie. Let's go. Become clear As you see me sitting there - What is your favorite group? -Oh. Chamber of commerce. - PTA, that sort of thing. -Yes. Heh. You might all have slept for a week had I not administered the universal drug antidote. Holy Rip van Winkle. One good thing did come of it, Robin. We now know who our adversary is. Poor Commissioner Gordon, he was so taken in by Catwoman. Mm. She's a very beautiful, very enthralling woman, Robin. When you get older, you'll see how easy it is to become lured by the female of the species. "Duncan Dance Studios, tango's our specialty, 3741 Laurel Avenue. " To the Batmobile. NARRATOR". Meantime, it's tea time for Wayne Manor houseguests. - There you are. I hope you like it. -Thank you. Help yourself to cream and sugar. I always think tea is so civilized, don't you? I didn't realize this custom had reached the colonies. Oh, my, yes, we serve tea every afternoon. - Oh, great. -When Bruce told me that you were going to stay here, I'd expected-- Don't tell me, you expected two grubby morons to come barging in here and start smashing up the place, didn't you? Well, l Heh. All right, Chad, start slashing cushions, I'll go deal with the crockery in the kitchen. Right. Don't worry, love, we're not really like that, you know, it's just our image. Oh You know, it's funny. But just because our fans are occasionally over-demonstrative people expect us to be the same way. Thank you. Well, for instance, Chad here was a medical student and I was reading for the law when our first record came out. We hope to go back to school as soon as we can to complete our education. - Mustn't be a dropout. -Don't be a dropout. Yes. Just think of it: Every record our fans buy brings me another notch closer to becoming a brain surgeon. Well, mercy alive. We can't appear at the Police Ball now. Not after you stole the commissioner's voice. Everybody knows you haven't really gone straight. Why don't you steal Batman's voice while you're at it? Never. One of the few joys I have in life is when his rich manly baritone caresses my ears with, "Catwoman, you're under arrest. " Oh, it makes everything worthwhile. Ha, ha. Well, they're going to track us down, Catwoman. Sure as shooting. They'll be at the dance studio in two shakes of a cat's tail. - And we just wait here? -Never you mind, my terrible trio of tabbies. Fear not. I have everything under control. Batman and Robin, it will be their final performance. Now, I want you two to pretend you're customers. And I want you No, no, no, I'm sorry. You see, the Watusi is definitely out. Now, maybe I can interest you in one of our seven-year courses in Magyar folk dances? Citizen. Ha, ha. Well, well, well. If it isn't, uh And, um Oh, isn't that awful? I know your names as well as I know my own. Benton Belgoody. - Batman. -And Robin. Well, how could I forget a thing-- Of course, what can I do for you, Robin? We're here to see Ms. Klutz, she's one of your dance instructors. Oh, yeah, well, I'm afraid that's impossible right now. You see, with all the new dance steps on the way out she's busy trying to find something that's on the way in. Just tell her Batman and Robin are here, Mr. Belgoody. And tell her fast. Well, my, my, there's a little bit of the devil in you, isn't there, young man? Ha, ha. Just as I suspected, Robin, she's up to her old tricks. Catwoman, can't you see the folly of your ways? With your beauty and intelligence, you could go much further helping your fellow man rather than harming him. A bit of whimsy that escapes me at the moment, Batman. Get him, guys. - You know something? -Hm? If he weren't such an old stick in the mud, I might let him live. But I think I can handle Batman. It's just that Robin's all work and no play. You know, maybe I can fix you up with Robin. Heh. No, it'd never work, he's too young. At that age, all they're interested in is baseball. Now, are you ready to come quietly, Catwoman? I guess so, Batman. Batman, can I ask you a favor before you send me up the river without a paddle? What is that? Can I freshen up a little bit with makeup? I mean, my image might be damaged if I was seen in public with a shiny nose. Yes, go ahead. But don't try anything untoward. Holy Heidelberg, what did she do that for? I afraid we've been drugged, Robin. I guess you can never trust a woman. You've made a hasty generalization, Robin, it's a bad habit to get into. But in this situation, it's entirely apr-- Apr-- Apropos. Wake up, little beddy-byes. Have you been beddy-bye? Catwoman. I'd advise you to yap as little as possible, boys. You've been encased in an enormous echo chamber weighing two tons. Every sound in there will be magnified Even your breathing will sound like thunder. Ha, ha. And don't bother looking for your utility belt. I've had it burned. Ha-ha-ha! - So, what's the purpose, CW? -it's so that the drip Why can't I get good help? Moe, turn on the faucet. I'm sure you recognize this as a variation of the legendary Chinese water torture. When I throw that switch the noise will become excruciating. And your eardrums will be shattered. Shortly following that your brains will be turned into "yuch. " And then I shall return and then you can be mine forever, Batman. True, I'll have to sacrifice your intellect. Oh, well, with a build like yours, who cares? After all, one can't have one's cake and eat it too. Heh. Ta-ta. 
NARRATOR". We have previously seen in a jewelry shop, an antique clock that does more than tell time. Second Hands in a split-second robbery. The mental mainspring of this timetable of crime, the Clock King. Batburgers at a drive-in. Batburgers? Now it's the Clock King disguised as a pop artist. Batman and Robin pop into the picture. The Dynamic Duo caught in the coils of time. Batman finds the Clock King's watch. A trail in the dust. Batman and Robin find Clock King's hideout. Blackjacks find the Dynamic Duo. And they find they're trapped in a giant hourglass. The Clock King's watch was a trap. Holy Sahara. NARRATOR". And their utility belts out of reach. Meanwhile, the sands of time pour down with relentless force. Is this to be the Caped Crusader's final adventure? In one moment, we'll come face-to-face with the moment of truth. It's no use, Robin. It's too thick. I've got it. Maybe we can plug up the neck of the hourglass with our capes. For how long, Robin? Have you forgotten? This glass is airtight. Even if the sand doesn't suffocate us, the lack of air will. Well, I guess we're finished. Don't give up yet, Robin. As long as we're alive, there's still a chance. I have an idea, Robin. It might work. You slam yourself against your side of the glass and I'll do the same against mine. Hurry. Holy squirrel cage. The glass didn't break. What do we do now? Squirrel cage. That's it, Robin. Start running around like a squirrel in a cage. I know I'm intruding on two very busy officials. Intruding, Mrs. Cooper? Heh. My door is always open to a lady as charming as yourself. And we do have Bruce Wayne in common, don't we? Upstanding citizen. Well, Bruce is really the reason I'm here. You see, today is his birthday. And while I was downtown shopping, I thought I'd drop by and see if I couldn't coax you into coming to a little surprise party for him at Wayne Manor tonight. You won't have to twist my arm, Mrs. Cooper. I'd be delighted. I'll second that. Good. Shall we say 7-ish? Very informal, and bring your wives, of course. Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Cooper. My direct line to Batman. Oh, how exciting. Yes, Batman? Robin too? Good. Thanks for calling. Not bad news, I hope? Ah. Merely checking in. Dependability is just one of the Caped Crusader's many fine qualities. Oh, I know. I talk of him and Robin so often to Bruce and Dick. What in the world Gotham City would ever have done without them I don't-- Oh. I don't mean to discredit your fine department. No need to apologize, Mrs. Cooper. We are all forever in debt to the Dynamic Duo. So intrepid and yet so incognito. - Sevenish, then? -Yes, indeed, 7-ish. - On the dot. -Goodbye. Goodbye. Good bye. What about Batman? He wanted to tell us that he had successfully escaped a vicious trap set for him by the Clock King. -Hmm. But that evil adversary is still at large and no doubt planning something even, hmm more monstrous. - Uniforms. -Check. Everything ready for the big job, Your Highness. This sure is tingling. Everything, including this box and its contents. If only Batman knew what was in this box. But he'll never know. No. Batman will never know anything anymore, eh, boys? That's right, Your Highness. You've done what nobody else could've done. You finished off Batman and Robin. Thank you. I deserve it, of course, but I thank you. Time to go to work. First I want to check up on that windmill clock bought by that dear little old lady. What dear little old lady? You'll see in a moment, Millie. And we'll see if that clock has been put to use yet. Oh, Alfred, look at what I got Bruce for his birthday. He'll be so pleased. He will indeed, madam. It's a rare antique. There are very few clocks left like it in the world today. It's beautiful, madam. I'm sure Mr. Wayne will be most pleased. Bruce Wayne? Bruce Wayne, the millionaire? Yes, by George. That lady's the aunt of Dick Grayson, Wayne's ward. When I learned she was shopping for a suitable clock in a clock shop I knew about I sold the clock to the shopkeeper, knowing he, in turn, would sell it to that lady. That brain of yours is always ticking away, Your Highness. Just like a clock. I'm a little tired after my shopping, Alfred. I think I'll take a nap to be nice and fresh for Bruce's birthday party tonight. Oh, he'll be so surprised. Bruce Wayne certainly will be surprised. Because he has a fine collection of old antique pocket watches which we are going to appropriate in a few minutes. Let's go. There's one thing that worries me, Your Highness. Nothing should be worrying any of us now so near to our great goal. But that clock on the lady's piano. That's the one I thought that you wanted me to put the little funny button on. It is. The control for the knockout gas. One whiff, the butler will be out cold and the antique pocket watches will be all mine. Oh, no. No. Not that button. I mean the button-- You-- You mean the Atomic Energy Directional Control Switch? - Well, whatever it is. -"Whatever it is"? Whatever it is is supposed to be in this box. - Not in that clock. -That's what worries me. - I think I made a mistake. -Mistake. You just pulled the biggest boneheaded blunder of the century. Now, If we don't get the windmill clock back from Bruce Wayne's mansion in short order our big job will be ruined. There isn't a minute to lose. Your Highness, I'm sorry. I never thought a funny little button-- An Atomic Energy Directional Control Switch is not a funny little button. That one's worth a cool million dollars to us. Millie. - You can be of great help to me right now. -Me? Gee. What do I do? Stay here and keep your eyes open, but stay out of sight. Oh, I'll certainly try. If I can remember all that. Gee. - I think I got a little sand down my neck too. -You're lucky it's only sand, Robin. An hourglass is not the most practical of conveyances. Anyway, here it is. Our entire file on crooks named Smith. Good. I'll feed them into the Batcomputer and see if we can get the data on the mysterious Mr. Smith Clock King mentioned. Hmm, I sure hope so. Boy, what I'd give to know where Clock King is right at this very minute. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, up in the Wayne living room The Atomic Energy Directional Control Switch is intact. I'm sure sorry about that mistake, Your Highness. While I'm here, I might as well pick up that valuable collection of antique pocket watches. I thought you said there wasn't a minute to lose. It won't take long. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, down in the Batcave Gosh, if we get the correct information we'll have the Clock King right where we want him. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, up in the Wayne living room Meanwhile, down in the Batcave It won't be long now, Batman. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, up in the Wayne living room That was fast. Time is of the essence. Let's go. Good afternoon. - Bruce's birthday clock! -Shh. - What are you doing here? Who are you? -Shh. Help! Alfred, Alfred! Help! Alfred! -It's the little old lady, Your Highness. -Dick Grayson's aunt. I think we better take her along with us. Alfred! NARRATOR". Meanwhile, down in the Batcave Why, it's Alfred's burglar alarm. There must be trouble upstairs. What do you mean, take me with you? Where? How? That's a good question, Your Highness. What do we put her in? Take these. I'll take care of her. No. Help, Alfred! You-- You called, madam? Holy hijackers. Clock King and his Second Hands robbing Wayne Manor. Why, the brazen-- Watch what you say. After all, we're not supposed to know them. Don't worry. Unhand my aunt. Sorry, gentlemen. We hope to make a safe getaway after lifting a few baubles from this handsome residence. Perhaps this sweet lady will provide that safety. You can take your baubles but you're not taking Mrs. Cooper out of this house as a hostage. We may have a difference of opinion there, mister. Quick. Out to the car. I think I'm going to faint. It's all right, Aunt Harriet. They're gone now. - They won't come back. Sit down. Sit down. -imagine me being a hostage. It's all right. It's all right. I'm sorry I wasn't of much help, sir. They gave me rather a bad time when they entered. That's quite all right, Alfred. Would you just see Mrs. Cooper up to her room, please, Alfred? Certainly, sir. Here we go, madam. There. That's right. Are we gonna let them get away just like that? By the time we got down to the Batmobile, they'd be long gone, Dick. At least they didn't get away with my private collection of antique pocket watches. Hmm. He seemed more concerned with that clock that they had. Maybe it could be a lead, Bruce. Wherever it came from. I still think the mysterious Mr. Smith will provide the lead we need. Let's get back to the Batcave. How about this? Sable Sam Smith who specializes in stealing valuable furs? Sorry, Robin. He's serving a jail term right now. Here's one. Gibralter Smith. Alias "Smitty Smith the Safecracker. " Smitty Smith was recently arrested for armed robbery. He's back pounding rocks. I can just see him now. Old Smitty Smith. He used to be a real swinger on the safe-and-lock circuit. Now he's swinging a hammer on a rock pile. I think you've got it, Robin. Clock King was making a pun on the name "Smith. " A Smith swings a hammer in a smithy. - Holy horseshoes. -Exactly, Robin. Mr. Smith is a blacksmith. What connection could there be between a blacksmith and Clock King? A blacksmith and a big-clock crime. A blacksmith and a big-clock crime. Blacksmith. Big clock. - Black-- -The big tower clock in downtown Gotham City. Let's take a look. Let's try another one. Hmm. - There's the blacksmith. -Yes, Robin. And every hour, that mechanical marvel brings his hammer down to strike the anvil in time with the clock. Clock King said that a certain Mr. Smith would be assisting with the crime at exactly 5:00. Maybe he's going to put something on the anvil that will be triggered by the hammer when it strikes. Thus his real objective must be something facing the clock tower. The only building facing the clock tower is that one with the rooftop heliport. Right, Robin. His real objective must be the heliport. Someone or something of value must be arriving at the heliport at exactly 5:00. Maybe Commissioner Gordon can provide us with an answer. Five o'clock, Batman? Hold on. Let me see. One, two, three, four, five Yes. There is one due at that time. A helicopter from the nuclear laboratory of the Gotham Institute of Technology. Well, two noted physicists will be delivering a cesium clock to the A. S. C. Corporation. Uh, purely routine. We've taken no special precautions. A cesium clock? Thank you, commissioner. What's a cesium clock? A cesium clock is one that's regulated by controlled atomic energy. It's frequently used in regulating satellite tracking or in space probes. Holy lift-off. And I read recently that a cesium clock is being delivered to the Amalgamated Communications Corporation for use in their tracking facilities. That means that it's the same clock that's being delivered by helicopter today at 5:00. But what use would a cesium clock be to Clock King? Lots of use, Robin. He could be holding the A. S. C. up for ransom because a cesium clock is worth at least a million dollars. We've no time to lose. To the tower. Atomic batteries to power. - Turbines to speed. -Roger. Ready to move out. What a setup. But why do you want me here, Clock King? Any man wants a beautiful woman at his side, Millie, at the climax of his career. - Gee. -Get the uniforms out. We've little time for this whole operation. Now, these uniforms, forged credentials and identification badges should give us carte blanche to unload the cesium clock. The box. - But I still don't understand. - No questions. You've already thrown us off schedule. We haven't got a minute to lose. Now, at 5:00, when the clock strikes 5 these figures will start to move. That hammer will come down on the box and trigger the knockout gas across to the heliport. It won't affect us in our gas masks. We transfer to the heliport and fly the cesium clock out on the helicopter. Simple. So very, very simple. Oh. I didn't know you could fly a helicopter. Millie, for a million dollars, a man can do almost anything. Now, into the uniforms. No. It can't be true. You're dead. You have to be dead. - Maybe we're living on borrowed time. -But now it's roundup time. Batman, look. His gun. Holy merry-go-round. That wild shot has started the clockworks moving. Get them before they get you. Five o'clock. - Not bad for timing, huh, Batman? -Yes, Robin. And that clock's tolling the end of Clock King's crimes. Great job, Batman. I couldn't have done better meself. Thank you, Chief O'Hara. That's high praise indeed. You and the Boy Wonder deserve a great deal of credit. Thanks to you, the Clock King is behind bars at last. And high time too. Uh, no pun intended, Batman. Agreed, commissioner. And I find it only fitting that Clock King, who made time serve his crimes must now serve time himself. Well put, Batman. And speaking of time, Chief O'Hara and I are late right now for the birthday party Dick Grayson's aunt is giving for millionaire Bruce Wayne. Robin and I had the honor of being invited too, commissioner. Unfortunately, we cannot attend. Oh, too bad. It should be quite an affair. It's a surprise party, you know. I'm sure millionaire Bruce Wayne will be quite surprised. - Well, Chief O'Hara, come on. - All right, commissioner. 
Batman So far we have seen a royal visitor arriving in Gotham City. A festive reception. With greetings from The Riddler. A dynamic duo to the rescue. Solve the tricky riddle. And then a beauty queen. . robbed of her tiara. Batman and Robin perplexed. Champagne for everyone. A vanishing king. More riddles in his place. The Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder are on his trail. Holy entanglement! Trapped like flies. Horrors strapped to The Riddler's whirling wheels. Can the dynamic duo escape a spinning death? Wait, the most fiendish is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Nana nana nana nana nana nana nana Batman Robin. . are you alright? Come on. Robin. Snap out, Robin. I must have passed out. Well, feels like taking a 100 rides on a supersonic roller coaster. One more revolution of that wheel will probably finish both of us. What happened? While they dragged us down here, some of the. . web-like material tore away from my hand and waist. I just barely managed to get the cutting torch out of my utility belt. You burned the armature and short-circuited the power. Golly, Batman, the utility belt saves again. Now, old friend, it's time to get back on The Riddler's trail. The following morning at the wallowing place of the evil river rats. Deep below Gotham City. Rise and shine! Sorry, my dear rats to disturb you all slumber but I believe you are working for me. Then sleep on your own time! - Where's Mousey? - She ain't here, chief. She'll be here soon. You know her types. They're never on time. Time. Time's of the essence. We have a tight schedule. Good morning. Late morning is more like it. You know I detest tardiness. I missed the bus! Big deal. It will be if you miss the caper. We have a great many important details to work over. Okay. I'm here. Relax. Yeah, Riddler, this thing'll be a cinch. For once, we don't have to worry about Batman and Robin. How true. So many people have tried. The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, The Joker. All masters of their craft, granted but I, only I have triumphed in ridding Gotham City's criminal kingdom of the dynamic duo. And good riddance it is. How frustrating it'll be for my colleagues when they'll learn that I succeeded where they failed. I'd sure like to see their faces when they hear about it? They'll have no one to outwit anymore. Regrettably, it is no longer our problem. For tomorrow we shall be miles and miles away in another country. With all that beautiful green dough. If everything goes according to plan, that is. And why shouldn't it? What if they refuse to pay? I've left them no choice. And my plan is foolproof, I promise you. I gotta go along with The Riddler. - He ain't stood us wrong yet. - Deeply touched. Whiskers, any problems last night with my friend the king? - Took him back safe and sound. - Good, good. Rats, I'm a man of few words but a man of many riddles. So riddle me this what is it that is always coming but never arrives? Quickly, quickly. We ain't tuned in on the riddle bit, chief. Yeah. We give up. What is it that is always coming but never arrives? Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. But when it arrives, it is today. And today, my dear rodents should prove to be most memorable. And that's all you can tell us, Your Majesty? It is exactly as I have explained. A sinister humoresque in mask and tights some other scoundrels, Batman and Robin being captured. It all happened so suddenly, so swiftly then I was returned to my hotel blindfolded. And you have no idea where you were at? None whatsoever. Alright, Your Majesty, thanks for your time. I feel terrible about Batman and Robin but I'm due at the Queen Of Freedom Monument. . - I could cancel that-- - Oh, no, no, Your Majesty. If we need further information, we'll contact you. Thank you, gentlemen. They're alive! Batman, are you alright? Yes, commissioner, we had a nasty turn but we came out of it alright. Have you spoken with King Boris? Yes, he's perfectly safe. On his way right now. for some festivities at the Queen Of Freedom Monument. And The Riddler? He left us in the clutches of death. Well, thank the stars that you managed to escape. Commissioner, with The Riddler thinking we're out of the way he might get a bit careless. I suggest that you don't tell anyone that we've contacted you. O'Hara and I won't tell a soul. Good, I'll be in touch. A riddle a day keeps The Riddler away. I won't forget you told me that. Don't. Whatever his evil scheme is he hasn't hatched it yet. I wonder what his next move will be. Let's get to the Bat-cave and be ready for it. 'From the Queen Of Freedom Monument. ' 'This station presents a special public affairs program. ' Yeah, this should prove very interesting. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Here we are at the Museum Of Fame housed inside the torch room high atop the inspiring Queen Of Freedom Monument. In just a few minutes, King Boris will present the museum with a gift indicative of his country's appreciation. A gold, bejeweled, miniature replica of the Queen Of Freedom. Here comes the king. And now His Majesty, King Boris. Good afternoon, Your Majesty. It is my great pleasure and honor to welcome you on behalf of our fair city, our nation and the television audience. My friends, it is the great honor for me to present Gotham City's Museum Of Fame with this statue. A symbol of courage and freedom to all the world. God bless you. Thank you, Your Majesty. On behalf of Gotham City and our country permit me to express our gratitude and also the hope that you thoroughly enjoy the remainder of your visit here. So there you have it, folks. The replica will now go on permanent display here along with other famous memorabilia. Some of which you might be able to see. Uh, over here for instance we have the original Gotham City Commodity Exchange building. And, uh, back here. . I think you can see, a bust of Gotham City's first mayor. And of course, how could our Museum Of Fame exist without Batman and Robin. I think they are cute. Just because we're on opposite side to the fence doesn't-- We were on opposite side to the fence. They're dead, remember? Take that thing off! 'The inspiring. . ' Thanks, Kenny. You're the best partner in crime I ever had. Later, on a Gotham City street corner. Good heavens! What? What is it? Alright, listen "If Gotham City does not pay me one million dollars in cash "by 10 o'clock tonight, the Queen Of Freedom Monument "will be blown sky high. "All security of its cannot stop the destruction "and only I can deactivate the bomb. PS, Batman and Robin. . are dead. The Riddler. " That infernal devil. Oh, so that was his plot. To get rid of Batman and Robin and then pull off the biggest extortion caper in the history of Gotham City. And he might just get away with it. So that's his scheme, commissioner. And obviously, the city must pay for it. But it's almost Half the city council are out of town They won't meet again until tomorrow. I couldn't get that kind of money if my life depended on it. Hmm, that is a problem. Could you get it from any private source? I don't know of anyone that has that kind of money readily available. - Except. - Except who? Well, except my good friend, Bruce Wayne the millionaire socialite. And by all means, call him, you can't waste any time. Alright, I'll contact you later, Batman. You understand, Bruce, this million dollars is just a loan. I don't know what this is all about, commissioner. But if it's in the best interest of Gotham City I'm certainly happy to do it. But you may not get all the kudos that Batman does. But believe me, Bruce, you're the unsung hero of this dark hour. Thanks. I just wanna do my duty as a proud citizen of this fair community. Batman! What the devil! It's Batman. Sorry, commissioner, I used the Bat-rope to get up here because I didn't wanna be noticed. I'm sure The Riddler has notified you that Robin and I were dead. Yes. Good. I wanted him to think that. But, Batman, we discussed-- I never had the pleasure of meeting Batman, commissioner. Oh, I-I'm sorry. Batman, this is my good friend, Bruce Wayne. Ah, the millionaire socialite. I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Wayne. The feeling is mutual. Ah, speaking of millionaires, did you get the money for The Riddler? I've just made the arrangements. Am I free to speak? I trust Bruce Wayne as I trust you, Batman. Good. I have a plan. I suggest no cops. Police, that is. have your men place the money 'inside the museum, in the torch room with the monument. ' 'Then they must leave. ' Million dollars is a lot of money. But The Riddler's smart and tricky. If he suspects a trap, he'll pass up the cash 'and destroy the monument. ' Then how do we catch him? You leave that to Robin and me. You have to deactivate the bomb wherever it is before he leaves. Then we will jump into action. 'I know nothing whatsoever' 'about this sort of thing, commissioner. ' But as a layman, it makes sense to me. Alright then, that's the way it'll be. You're a smart man, Mr. Wayne. We should get together sometime and discuss crime prevention. With pleasure. I'll look forward to seeing you in the near future. Batman! Take it easy, you're not seeing a ghost. That's Whitey. ! How did it go? Great, uh, Gordon went for it like a duck to water. And that millionaire socialite Bruce Wayne was there also. Well, he fell so hard for the act that he helped sell our plan to Gordon. And the coast will be clear. Clear! As your gorgeous brown eyes, my little Mousey. Oh, I've really outdone myself this time. Oh, genius. Sheer genius. Robin, Robin, where are you? 'Up here. ' What are you doing up there? It was making a funny rumbling noise. I thought some part might be loose. Just checking it out. Did you, uh, give Commissioner Gordon the money? Yes, I also met Batman. Oh. You what! Very interesting. The Bat-phone's ringing. Yes, commissioner. By any remote possibility, were you in my office this afternoon? 'No, why?' I didn't think so. But someone impersonating you was here. I played along with the hoax because Bruce Wayne was present. I didn't wanted to expose him to any danger. Good for you. You did exactly as you should have done. Did he give you any instructions? Fine. You do just what he says. In the meantime, I'll map out a plan. What was it? As I was telling you The Riddler had someone impersonate me today. I knew he'd get careless if he thought we were out of the way. But how do we stop him? The clinch here would be to solve this last riddle. "Why is a woman in love like a welder?" I bet that'll tell us the location of the bomb alright. Well, stop fiddling with that atomic pile and come down here. Two heads are better than one, old chum. Okay, I can't fix it anyway. Not without a torch. Great Scott! - A torch. That's it. - Huh? "Why is a woman in love like a welder?" Because they both carry a torch. Holy conflagration! The torch room at the Queen Of Freedom. But how could The Riddler place a bomb there? He didn't, King Boris did. What? King Boris? I'll explain on the way. Darkness flows over Gotham City. But on a shadowy balcony, in the torch room of the Queen Of Freedom Monument. . How does it look? Two policemen came earlier they placed the black bag down there. Then left. Good, good. Perfect, perfect! That's the landing. Wonderful. My friends, plan 136-triple A is about to begin. Mousey, you stay her and be the lookout. Good luck. Onward. Beautiful, beautiful. Beautiful! - Can we see the dough? - Not now, you dope. I have to deactivate the bomb first. Or do you want to be blown to smithereens? Now just. . The replica. It's gone. What squeals louder than a cotton rat? Answer, several cotton rat. I've been out-riddled. But the dough. They fooled me with my own trick. That's the only way we can smoke you out. What? Is this what you're looking for, Riddler? 'Clever of you to place' 'a time bomb inside it when you kidnapped King Boris. ' Knowing he was gonna present it here the following day. Poor fellow was nothing but an innocent stooge. But you're dead, Batman. Not quite! We foiled your villainous death plot. The bomb, it'll go up any second. Don't worry. I deactivated it. Now we're going to deactivate you. There are four of us against the two of you. But we're not afraid. Ha! I'll never understand why girls like you get involved in things like this. Kicks, I guess. I've been looking for them ever since I dropped out of high school. But I'm sort of glad they didn't do you in. Thank you. Uh! Time to go, Riddler to jail. There's just nothing like a good cup of tea. Well, I'm off. Where you going Aunt Harriet? Oh, I have some out of town friends who are visiting Gotham City for the day. I thought I'd take them to see the Queen Of Freedom Monument. Say, would you like to join us? Uh, no, thanks, Aunt Harriet. I've some Wayne Foundation business reports to go over. - Oh. - Perhaps, Dick. No! I've got my algebra. Well, alright, but you're missing a treat. It's a very interesting place, you know. I'm sure it is, Aunt Harriet. Probably more interesting than you could imagine. The algebra. Ah! Next week, the Joker returns.

NARRATOR". When we last saw the Dynamic Duo the fiendish Joker had tied them to an altar in the Gotham City Museum beneath a huge meteorite which will fall when its supporting cable is cut by a revolving thermite fuse. How much time before they're crushed? Certainly less than when we left them. Holy mashed potatoes. - When the thermite burns through the cable-- -We still have one slim chance, Robin. I've managed to loosen my hand slightly. If I can just break out my Batarang, maybe I can divert that thermite. Agh! There it is, Robin. Now, we'll need patience. I won't be able to make my throw until the thermite is directly overhead. - But by then, it'll be almost at the cable. -Yes, Robin. I'll have just three seconds to aim and throw. What the devil could have happened to Batman? Sure and we've been up all night waiting for him to call. Commissioner, I'm getting worried. You have a point, Chief O'Hara. - We'll call Batman. -All right. For that, you'll need a medium. I'm sorry to report that the Tenacious Twosome have been trapped, tied and terminated. That's a lie. Well, actually, I have the wrong tense. They will be squashed in a matter of moments. - You're raving! -Ah! Caution, commissioner. No, I'm not raving, I'm raiding. My next target, Libra, the Scales. In here? No, out there. That, sir, is a statue of Justice. And carved of priceless Carrara marble. Cash value, half a million. Why, have you no scruples, you jesting jackanapes? Scruples? Ha-ha-ha! The cash value of scruples is 0. No, I prefer Carrara marble. As for Justice, she shall be served with a hook. At the precise moment the Dynamic Duo become the Mashed Marauders. - You demon! -Ah! Quick-frozen cops. What a delightful dish. Ha-ha-ha! Now to put the snatch on Justice. Careful. Oh, careful. There's half a million in Carrara marble there. Now, marble going up, meteorite going down. And now But there's a chance the thermite will burn right through our bonds. We would've been tomato paste. Instead, Joker's going to be canned. Away, away, away. Ha-ha-ha! - What happened, commissioner? -Shock paralysis, chief. Fortunately, it only lasts a few minutes. Commissioner Gordon speaking. Sound the alarm. The Joker is escaping via the side entrance. After them! They've stolen Justice! Get the police radio band, Robin. Joker's probably been busy while we were tied to that altar. Calling all cars, calling all cars. The Joker has stolen Justice. Tow truck carrying the lady believed heading for Juniper Street. All cars in the vicinity proceed at once to Juniper Street. Juniper Street it is. Attention. This is car number 72. Have just spotted the tow truck in vicinity of Mulberry Lane. Am pursuing. How did that truck get to Mulberry Lane in two minutes? Joker probably has that truck souped-up. We'd better head for Mulberry Lane. Attention. This is car number 41. Have just seen tow truck at intersection of Dopple and Briar Streets. Am pursuing. Brace for Bat-turn. Attention. This is car number 98. Have spotted tow truck traveling west on Finley Road. Am pursuing. Holy sonic booms, Batman. That truck couldn't have gotten to Finley Road this fast. Nor could it be traveling west since Finley Road runs north and south. Switch on the police radio band cut-in. Attention all squad cars. Attention all squad cars. This is Batman speaking. Disregard all instructions broadcast on this wavelength. Batman. You're supposed to be dead. Crushed by that meteorite. Well, I'm not dead, Joker. Neither is Robin. We escaped that cunning trap of yours. Incredible, impossible. But a fact, Joker. And justice will catch up with you. Oh, you're wrong there, Batman. I've stolen Justice. And dead or alive, you're too late to stop the next theft of my criminal zodiac. Scorpio. You're right, Boy Prunehead. At this moment, the brightest star in my criminal constellation is about to make off with Scorpio, the scorpion. Ha-ha-ha! Be stinging you, Batman. Brightest star? He must mean Venus. We mustn't judge her too harshly, Robin. Even with the best intentions, it's hard to change a lifetime of habit. That gives me an idea. Let's see that rare art map, Robin. Ah. There it is, the Joker's next target. Of course, the famous Durand Golden Scorpion. It's the same jewelry store that he robbed before. Let's just hope we're in time to keep Venus from making another tragic error. You. - Yes, madam? -Brindle, Special Branch. - About your recent robbery. -Oh, yes, tragic, terrible. May be another. Understand you have a priceless antique jeweled scorpion, correct? Yes, uh, Ms. , uh-- Officer-- Just call me Brindle. - Let's see the scorpion. -Yes, of course. Uh-huh. Just as I thought. Fake. I'm taking this down to headquarters. And you had better have a good explanation. But, Ms. Brindle, did you say the scorpion is fake? Oh, no, the scorpion isn't fake. I am. Ha-ha-ha! Come back with my scorpion. Hurry up, please. - The scorpion, is it still here? -Dynamic Duo. Where were you when I needed you? We're too late. It was that girl again. I'm ruined. First the Twins, now the Scorpion. You'll get them back just as soon as we catch up with Joker. If anyone can do it, Dynamic Duo, you can. Good luck. - Venus? -Undoubtedly. But the main question is, where will Joker strike next? - The next sign of the zodiac. -Which is Sagittarius, the Archer. There sure aren't any golden archers in Gotham City. There may not be a golden archer, Robin, but there is a golden Bowman. Basil Bowman, wealthy friend of millionaire Bruce Wayne. No doubt the Joker intends to steal him. Let's go. Excuse me. Is this the residence of the well-known millionaire Basil Bowman? -it is. - And is he at home? -He is. - And may we see him? -You do. Oh, ha, ha! Delighted, Mr. Bowman. Ha-ha-ha. - Well, what do you want? -You. Wrap him up, boys. Do you dare, knowing the Dynamic Duo will be dogging your trail? Those fleas? Fah! Ha-ha-ha. Wrap him up, boys. Ha-ha-ha. - Batman and Robin. -Batman. Batman. - Smash them, smash them! -Don't you dare! Thank you, Venus, but I believe we can handle this. Oh, you do, Batman? One move and Venus is a dead dolly. I think we can find a more favorable occasion for a showdown with the Caped Crusaders. Don't let him get away, Batman. It doesn't matter what he does to me. Oh, Batman won't endanger a girl, now, will you, Batman? Tripped up by your own ethics. Ha-ha-ha! He who trips last, trips hardest. My final prediction for the day: I'm going to get clean away. And you, traitress, will pay. Venus, are you all right? Batman. I spoiled everything. The Joker got away and it's all my fault. Don't worry, Venus, we will catch him eventually. Could I help? Please? Are you being sincere, Venus? Very sincere. I'm ashamed of all the crimes I've committed. If you'd like to help me, you could help a great deal. Oh. Think of it. Me, working with the Dynamic Duo. If only I'd met you when I was younger. A crooked path can often be straightened, Venus. Oh, and mine will be straight. And I'll start by helping you get back the Lion and the Crab. - Leo Crustash, the opera singer. -Yes. Yes. - Is this the place, Venus? - Yes. You'd better wait outside, Venus. There may be trouble. Batman! Ow! Where's Crustash? Stop that sound. My voice, the tension. - You're all right, Mr. Crustash? -Crustash is alive and kicking. - Where have you been, Batman? -Searching for you. Where is Joker? Who knows? Who cares? After spending a day in there listening to that Music to Drill Teeth By ugh, I gave him the ransom he demanded. And he didn't even cut that thing off! What ransom? What ransom? One hundred thousand dollars, Batman. If Joker's already gotten it, he might be off anywhere putting it to no good purpose. Well, then call the bank and see if he cashed the check. A check? What bank? Gotham National. We still may have time, Robin. - Let's go! -I think we're too late, Batman. Joker cashed that ransom check two hours ago. Now that you're caught, young woman, I hope you realize that crime doesn't pay. I think Venus already realizes that, Chief O'Hara and she isn't exactly caught. She has volunteered to help us track down Joker. And she's taking a big risk too. - Because if the Joker ever got a hold of her - You're right. 'Tis a fine thing you're doing, lass. I can give you my assurance, young lady. The authorities will take this into consideration at your trial. I just wish I knew what Joker planned for his next crime. There are only three signs of the zodiac left. Capricorn, the Goat, Aquarius, the Water Bearer, and Pisces, the Fish. Let's see, Capricorn is-- Wait a minute. Isn't there a meeting of the International Society of Zoologists in Gotham City? Sure. And they're using one of the park fountains to display their tropical fish. Precisely, Robin. Pisces, the Fish. In particular, Palaremus Demnese of which there are only two living specimens left in the entire world. Both being displayed in that park fountain. - I think we'd better get right over there. - Can I come along, Batman? I won't mind going to prison if I know I've helped put the Joker there too. When you put it that way, my dear, we could hardly refuse. What a magnificent geronimus, Dr. Gorly. Beautiful. And that is the finest specimen of valperima I have ever seen. - But look over there, Dr. Gorly. -Ugh. How hideous. What is it? A goldfish. Ach. Ah! But look over there. The prize of the zoological world. Palaremus Demnese. Exquisite, exquisite. - You must be Dr. Gorly of the society. -Yes. A pleasure to see you, Batman. A pity more of our citizens do not take an interest in science. I'm afraid we're going to have to move your fish, especially the Palaremus Demnese. Ah! You know about the Palaremus. Unfortunately, so does a certain master criminal who's plotting to steal it. Steal the Palaremus? That music. The Joker. Look out, Batman. Holy red snapper, Batman. They're throwing fish at us. Into my net, you lovely little Palaremus. Oh, ha-ha-ha! The fishnapping of the century. Ha-ha-ha! Careful you don't get caught by a red herring, Batman. Let us away. To the Batmobile. Be careful, Batman. Don't worry, Venus. Don't let them catch you from behind. Good advice, desertress. Keep your head down, Robin. And keep your hands inside the car. They're heading for the warehouse. And so are we. These bullets are getting too thick. We'll have to take a detour. Our two fish are about to rise to the bait. Everybody, get out of sight. - Something's fishy here, Batman. - Ha! Beautiful, Boy Beanhead. I couldn't have made a better pun myself. Ha-ha-ha. Look out, Robin. Well, what species have we here? Oh! It looks like Dynamicus Duos, a rare breed of caped fish. - How about a fish fry? -Ooh! I have an even better idea. Let's feed our fish to the fish. Ha-ha-ha! And don't forget, we have a little bird as well. Batman, are you all right? Don't worry, my little pigeon. You'll be joining your friends for dinner. A three-course meal. Yes. Wasn't I right, Batman? A most appropriate place for a showdown. You monster. A monster perhaps, but a highly-successful monster. With you and Robin out of my way and my zodiac crimes completed I'll have all of Gotham City under my control. Oh, and I'm a tenderhearted monster too. I couldn't possibly deprive that poor, hungry clam of its dinner. That would be cruelty to animals, yes. Ha-ha-ha. Very touching. Oh, Boy Wonder what a succulent hors d'oeuvre you should make. Ha-ha-ha! Yes, and as for you, my ex-felonious friend, let this be a lesson to you once and for all that honesty does not pay. Yeah. Oh, what a hideous fate. Don't lose hope, Venus. A clam is only a bivalve mollusk. Some mollusk. Push yourself away, Robin. I can't, Batman. I'm pinned against the side. Robin. Robin! Batman, he'll be eaten alive! Batman, help! Help, Batman! Help! 
We have already seen chaos on the stock exchange. Extortion. This gentle minstrel is a threat? You bet. How to trace him? Perhaps by this ingenious bird. Affirmative. How to gain entry? But it's a trap. Batman prepares for another trap. Not a trap door. And a rotating spit. Rare, medium, well done? While a musical monster supplies his accompaniment. Can the Dynamic Duo survive this? Are they and their goose to be permanently cooked? Hang on and find out in just one sizzling minute. Batman and Robin rotate and revolve As the heat mounts You'll lose all resolve In a few minutes, we will be prepared To leave you here cooking and exit this lair I've about had it, Batman. I know. Try to hang on, old chum. - What's that? -Sounded like an explosion. Well, let's find out. It's the Bat Bombs I planted. It caused the distraction I needed. If we could just shake this turnspit pole and snap. Looks like we've been bombed, boss. Obviously a diversionary tactic, let's get back down to quarters. Our barbecue chef will be right back. Let's surprise him. Minstrel, they're gone. Now. Holy fireworks. Look. A wandering minstrel I And now's the time to wander To give me time to ponder For my men have gotten their lumps I don't indulge in fisticuffs or vulgar brawling I hear far places calling I'll come back when I hold all the trumps I'll come back when I hold all the trumps I have yet to admit defeat, Robin but I do find him somewhat frustrating. -At least we've captured his headquarters. His headquarters, but certainly not his broadcasting studio nor his henchmen, apparently. - Let's go after them. -No, Robin. Why bother with riffraff, it's the Minstrel we want. He may've taken some of the wind out of my sails with that murderous barbecue-- Some but not all. Hello, I'm Octavia. Your purse. I didn't mean that. I mean, I surrender. That's hardly necessary. Just from looking at you, I'm sure your presence here is innocent. Appearances are deceiving, Batman. Appearances, perhaps. Instinct, seldom. That's nice. You're nice. I think I might like it better being on your side. It's always a satisfactory feeling knowing you're on the side of right, Octavia. I wasn't talking about right. I know. - Are you taking me in? -Where? - Why? -Thank you, Batman. Perhaps some other time, some other place. I hope so. Then goodbye for now. You're letting her go? Well, I admit she's gorgeous, Batman, but what did she have the others didn't? Well, Robin, for one thing, she has a tracking device which I just placed in her handbag. But Batman found the heterodyning counter oscillator that was planted by the Minstrel. We're not after bugs. We're after the Minstrel himself and he walked out of the stock-exchange building as free as a bird. - What are you trying to say, Chief O'Hara? -We haven't heard from the Caped Crusader. And the Minstrel's been on the air with another warning. He also warned Batman. Or could it be some kind of a signal? Have you the temerity to imply that Batman was working with the Minstrel? I don't want to imply it, but mother machree, commissioner what do we really know about Batman and Robin? Two-- Two masked figures. Two voices on the telephone. Whence did they come? Whither do they go? Whence and whither be dashed, Chief O'Hara. Isn't it enough to know they're saviors of Gotham City? Ahh. And helped out from time to time from a department of which I am the chief, may I add. You may not. As a matter of fact, I have a darn good mind to-- - Yes, Batman? -I would've called you sooner but I have nothing tangible to report. I still don't. As a matter of fact, we were a little concerned. And rightly so, Minstrel is tricky and cunning. But I would like to assure you now that Robin and I won't rest until he's safely behind bars for good. Would you pass that on to your stalwart co-fighter in crime, Chief O'Hara? Uh, yes, indeed, Batman. Now, Chief O'Hara. It's hard for a proud man like meself to ask forgiveness and to admit mistakes but Commissioner Gordon I was foolish and wrong, and I'm sorry. Spoken like the upstanding gentleman and officer of the law that all Gotham City has come to love and admire, Chief O'Hara. To defame the Dynamic Duo, even by implication is both unjust and reprehensible. They are the guardian angels of this city. Those two masked figures those two voices on the telephone. What do you think the boss is gonna do? I don't know. He's pretty angry. Yeah. He sure hates to lose. What happened? Didn't Batman take you to jail? No, of course not. As a matter of fact, he was very considerate. - Very nice. - I'm sure. Well, he was. He's quite a gentleman. - Think you've got it? -Pretty close. - Shall we send the Bat-drone Plane again? -That won't be necessary, Robin. Minstrel, you don't really have to be so drastic. Batman's reasonable, maybe you could make a deal with him. A deal? Me, make a deal with that paragon of propriety. That righteous reformer, that enemy of enterprise that thorn in my flesh? Never. Anyhow, he wouldn't do it. What gave you that idea anyhow? You must've had a very cozy little chat with Batman or should I say, warm, intimate. He was a perfect gentleman, I tell you. I see what you meant when you said she was special. What did you say? I said he was a perfect gentleman. Ha! That's what the perfect gentleman was doing when he was being so considerate - bugging your purse. -Why, that spy. That spy fink. That does it. Listen to me, Batman. We go to plan High C. Oh no, boss. Not plan High C. What if it gets out of control? Yeah. It could bring the whole world down. The world? Holy cosmos. That's a big order, Robin. Who cares? So what? It's their world. Here me again, Batman. You thought you were being so very clever bugging the lady's purse to track down the location of this studio. Well, better than finding my studio I suggest you might want details of my plan, High C. Join your broker friends in the conference room of the stock exchange in exactly 30 minutes, and I wouldn't be late. Have Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara and Mr. Cortland too. I'm sure they'll find it most interesting. Over and out. I'm sorry to bother you, sir. It's Mrs. Cooper. She was quite concerned when you were away last night. I trust you supplied her with a plausible excuse, Alfred. I did my best, sir. But could you tell me, perhaps, when you will be home? We have a brief stop first, we're trying to prevent-- The end of the world. End of the world? - Is it time yet? -Close. One minute, 45 seconds. What do you think he'll do, Batman? I wish I could guess. Maybe we should've gone along with him from the first. You mean give into blackmail? That's ruin. - What is it if we don't? -You suppose he's bluffing? I wouldn't count on it. - What's that? -What's what? I don't know, but look. And the chandelier. The whole room be going. It's an earthquake. What's happening, Batman? Nothing's shaking. It's not an earthquake. It's the Minstrel. - It stopped. -What--? How could it have happened, Batman? How did he do it? I don't know how he did it. I do know what he did. He must've determined the frequency of this building using the ventilating shafts as resonant chambers he generated a corresponding frequency. I see. The same way a singer can shatter a crystal glass by hitting its resonant note, right? Right. Precisely, Robin. It's called "sympathetic vibration. " Of course, that would be a high note. His must've been subsonic. Impossible for the human ear to detect. Too low. Then if he hadn't stopped, the building would've shaken itself apart. - Right. -That means he could-- Batman, everybody. He's on the air. Well, gentlemen, how did you like the sample? - And now, this message. - He's so suave. I am the Minstrel And a mastermind I'm a modern genius crook In electronics, I cannot be surpassed And that's why your building shook To my terms you must agree Or vibration, consternation, desolation Throughout the nation Accept my terms or there will be Irreversible calamity You have until nightfall To prevent a frightful downfall Here are the terms. One: The certified checks made out as you were instructed will be turned over to Commissioner Gordon. Two: Commissioner Gordon will deliver them to my men when I so request. Three: Announcement of your agreement to this will be made on this channel at 6 o'clock sharp or the stock exchange becomes a pile of rubble. And there is nothing Batman can do to stop it. Remember, 6 o'clock sharp. - We've got to do it. -We can't do it. Are you mad? He means it. Yes, but a quarter million dollars a week? - Is there any alternative, Batman? -There just may be, commissioner. It's not true, gentlemen, that your building will inevitably be disintegrated. For no matter what exotic and brilliant devices the Minstrel's installed, he cannot operate without power. Holy kilowatts, of course. - Cut off the power. -How simple. Not so simple, to locate all the circuits in this building and connect them to one master switch in the allotted time. But it can be done. Then at the first sign of vibration, you just throw the switch? Marvelous. What if he does something else? We can't risk it. If you knuckle under to this extortionist now do you think he'll stop at a quarter million a week? - He may demand anything. -That's it, Robin. Gentlemen, even at the risk of seeing this entire neighborhood collapse under your feet would you spend the rest of your lives in the shadow living in subservience to this rascally ruthless tyrant? Go ahead, Batman we'll stand fast. Good. I'll need your building engineer and your entire electrical crew. You have them, Batman. We'll assemble here before 6 o'clock, with our board of governors. More here than I expected. Blind faith in the Batman, I guess. Well, the way I see it, if Batman can't help us there's no hope anyhow. Oh. Oh, there he is now. - Everything's set. -I think so. - That the open line? -That's it. Good. This is Batman. Are the switches ready? - Ready, Batman. -Good. Standby. - We made it. -And in the nick of time. Light the candles. - Do you think he might change his mind? -No chance. Time. - Throw the switches. -Right. Wait. What's that? Look at the chandelier. - Turn it off. -I can't. He's broadcasting. Here he is. Do I have you attention? Batman, your world will tumble down, Just wait and see Your city will disintegrate, It matters not to me Batman's and Robin's strength Will not avail no matter what they do They're bound to fail They can't evade my sonic beam And they'll become a vapor trail Which should be evident to the most obtuse by now, I think. However, there's still time to change your minds though not much. If you wish my protection, simply say so, I'll get the word. But I'm warning you, do not delay. - He's got us. -Batman has obviously failed. - We've got to do it. -All right. We give up. You've got a deal, Minstrel. Well, at least we're still alive in spite of this devious devil. But for what? To knuckle under to the scoundrel all our lives? Fortunately, that won't be necessary. - What? -That is correct. For, as it happens, gentlemen we have located Minstrel. - Just a minute. -That's the Minstrel? That nice looking young man? But how can he be here in this room and on TV at the same time? - It was a prerecording. -This is ridiculous. - We knew he'd be here. -To signal a cutoff. Why destroy a 10 million dollar building belonging to people he wanted money from? We went through with it so he would suspect-- But I'm not the Minstrel. All right, Batman. You asked for it. Bass, Treble. All the rest of you. It won't work, Minstrel. We're wearing our Particle Bat Accelerator units. To create an anti-charge and deflect your static bolts. So there's no way out, Minstrel. All right, Chief O'Hara. You can take him away. And this time, Minstrel, no song, please. I don't think you'd be doing any singing in public for a long, long time. Come along, you. Good evening. Late this evening that melodic master of crime who, earlier, came within a tremble of subjugating all of Gotham City is now on his way to the city jail thanks, once again, to our savior Batman. You may be interested to know that bail has been denied. However, before he is incarcerated we have been granted this exclusive interview. Oh, look. They've arrested that charming man. REPORTER". Tell me, Minstrel Man. Due to the fact that you have been defeated by the Dynamic Duo despite your electronic genius do you have any plans in your future for crime? Why, yes. As a matter of fact, I have. Wait till the jail break Batman You've not seen the last of me I'll clobber you and Robin Wait and see You'll vibrate both together I'll shake off your heads Oh, just you wait Till the jail break Batman You'll be dead Uh Thank you very much, Mr. Minstrel Man. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our program for tonight. Take him out. Now. Surely a man with such a voice can't be all bad. Perhaps he can learn to make an honest living when he comes out of prison. If only someone would help. Commissioner Gordon is a friend of yours, isn't he? Why, yes, he is, Aunt Harriet. In a way. And even though Minstrel might sneer at such a suggestion I will bring it to his attention. Who knows? It just might work. 
NARRATOR". As you recall, we left Batman and Robin staked out by Shame in the path of a cattle stampede. Things haven't improved any since we left them. And in a moment, we'll see what happens. Just a few seconds left, Batman, and there's no way out. Courage, Robin. Keep your mask up. The rumbling of the cattle zooms has loosened my stake. Stay right where you are, Robin. Don't make a move. OlÃ©, Batman. Hey. Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo, more. - OlÃ©. -OlÃ©, Batman. OlÃ©. Oh. Unh. Phew. Oh. I always thought they went for red capes, Batman. Merely an affectation, Robin. Something to make the corrida seem more colorful. Actually, bulls are colorblind, they react to movement, not to color. Holy toreador. The word is "matador," Robin. "Toreador" is a word of convenience used by Bizet in his classic opera Carmen. - Oh. Holy matador, then. -Very apt. Batman, Boy Wonder, what happened? I thought it was all a game. It was, Andy, the most dangerous game of all. And the stakes were life and death. And we darn near died. There's one thing in life you should learn, it's to listen to your father and mother and I don't think they'd approve of your association with Shame. You're right, Batman, I should have known better. But after all, I'm only 7 years old. You're never too young to learn the difference between good and evil. If I see him, I'll walk on the other side of the street, I promise. But I'd sure like my radio back. We'll see about that. Let's go, Robin. We've set another youth on the road to a brighter tomorrow. Goodbye, Andy. Now that we know he's building a truck, we'll have to discard our theory that he's stealing parts so he can race a car in the Gotham Grand Prix. Sure, and that 100,000 in prize money is just cattle feed to Shame. Yet what could his reason be? I suggest we visit the one man in Gotham City who knows what's happening in the world of wheels. - Hot Rod Harry at KGC. -Yeah. Good luck, Dynamic Duo. Shame, come back. Come back, Shame. Shame, come back. And now, stay tuned for the news on KGC. The number-one rated radio station in the world. Stationville, breakville, nowsville. Well, hello, Caped Crusaders. What can I do for you? Shame is building a super-fast truck. We're trying to figure out why. Well, the drag races are all over for the year other than that, I can't think of a thing, Boy Wonder. Hey, there is one other cat who knows more about where the automotive action is than the top-rated DJ in GC town. Who's that, Mr. Harry? Laughing Leo, the used car and truck magnate on Surf Avenue and 20th Street. - Thank you. -Keep punching, fellows. You have my word as a used car dealer. This car was formerly owned by an oyster salesman who only drove it in months with an R in them. Ha-ha-ha. I certainly hope so. I came all the way from Pasadena to buy this car. - Bye,honey. -Goodbye. Ha-ha-ha. Welcome, welcome. Hello, friends, looking for a new or one-only used car? Not quite, we came to-- Ah, that old job of yours is starting to look a little bit tacky. Wouldn't be interested in something more modern? I can put you in a beaut for only 1000 down and this old clunker thrown in. Ha-ha-ha. Know of anything in the car world that Shame might wanna get involved with? Shame? Ha-ha-ha. - Which Shame is that? -The conniving cowboy of crime. Oh, that Shame. Ha-ha-ha. - Sorry, can't help you. -Let's go, Robin, we'll get no place here. Look, 500 down, now, that's my last offer. How about it? - Sorry, can't help you. -Well Come again. Ha-ha-ha. Goodbye. Oh, hello there, Laughing Leo, you come over to give us more good news? Well, this truck's ready to take on anything. Of course, it don't make a heap of difference now that Batman and Robin took the big leap. - Funny you should mention that. -Yeah. - We gonna steal them there Black Anguses. -What, where Black Anguses? Oh, them prized cows at the Gotham City Rodeo. Worth 300,000 bucks each. And four of them totals up to one million, two hundred thousand, all together. Which we're gonna sell out west to some unscrupulous cattle ranchers. Ha, ha. Boy, don't that just about fry your eyeballs. Ha-ha-ha. I couldn't be happier. I ain't smiled so much since I ran out of notch room on my gun handle. Batman and Robin done in. Us gonna get a potful. Things just couldn't be better. All right, Leo, what did you come to talk to me about? Well, I don't quite know how to tell you this, but, uh Well, now, don't stand there chewing your cud, spit it out, boy I don't like a dallying tongue. Batman and Robin are still alive. They came over to my place asking questions. What's happened? He's angrier than a hyena with laryngitis. - Shame? -Hush up, Leo. When he gets this way maybe you don't see nothing, but it ain't safe to ask no questions. And exactly where was the Wayne limousine found, Alfred? On a shadowy side street, sir, in a Gotham City suburb. I hope you didn't mind my dismantling it for you. Not at all, Alfred. You saved us at least 15 minutes by doing that. But I'm afraid we've struck out. There's not a fingerprint to be found anywhere. - Here's the last item, sir. Mm-hm. There's a tiny green speck and an even tinier red speck on it. Robin, here, take a look at this. What do you think it is, Batman? The red speck appears to be chili and the green speck is avocado. Do you know what that means? That Shame is a sloppy eater? Partly, but what restaurant serves the best chili and avocado dip in Gotham City? Holy guacamole. The Adobe Hacienda Motel and Eats on the inbound state highway. Let's go. We're too late, Batman, now we'll never find him. Don't fret, old chum. Let's figure this out. Shame would have to hide until tonight because he can't travel during the daytime in those peculiar looking clothes. Right? As rain, Batman. Where would a bunch like that hole-up? - You've got me. -I think he went back to Westernland. He knows that we know about his hideout there. Correct. However, knowing that, he'd think that we'd think he would not return there therefore, he did and so will we. - Holy Bat-logic. -Let's go. But boss, how did you know? I knew he'd think I'd think he'd think I'd think he'd come back here. All right, you got clear aim. Let them have it. We've been bushwhacked. Quick, behind the bullet-proof Bat-mobile. Another hero bites the dust, I plugged the Boy Wonder. All right, let's vamoose. - Where did he get you, Robin? -In the heel. We'll have to get that out fast. Here, bite down on this. Steady, Robin. There. Let's go after them, Batman. No, we'll have to get you back to the Batcave. Where you can get proper medical attention. You'll need blankets, some hot water and plenty of Baticillin. It feels perfect, Batman. The Baticillin lozenges I gave you worked instantly. Too bad they got away before we could question them. That's crime business, Robin. It's all in the game. Yes, Alfred. I beg your pardon, sir, but your scheduled to serve as Grand Marshal at the annual Gotham City Rodeo. -Great Scott. On the horns of our dilemma, I'd overlooked that. Should be quite an interesting affair. Apart from the usual steer roping, bulldogging and bare back riding there's the exhibition of the prized Black Angus cattle. - What cattle? -Black Angus, sir, four of them. Each worth more than $300,000 for, ahem, breeding purposes. - That's it, Robin. -What's it, Batman? It's staring us right in our masks. They must be what he's after. Alfred, call the coliseum commission and convey Bruce Wayne's regrets that he will be unable to attend. But, sir, think of your public image. No one will miss Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson once they see Batman and Robin. To the Batmobile. Now, nobody flick an eyelash, this here is a holdup. I don't want them bacon drippings, I got bigger fish to fry. - Rip. - Yeah? - Get that freight elevator ready. - Okay, boss. - Messy? - Yeah, boss. - Get them cattle rounded up. - Right, boss. All right, get in line. You heard me. Pull that cow out. Come on, move. Okie Annie, keep your gun aimed on these folks - and this time, aim to kill. Get it? - Got it. Good. The rodeo is on the main floor, but the bulls are shown on the upper level. What happens if we've guessed wrong, Batman? If they aren't what Shame is after? Think positive, Robin. But you do have a point. Stand clear. These short Bat-climbs are harder than the longer ones. It takes a while to unlimber your muscles, Robin. It's all good training. Colonel, what are doing here in Gotham City? I'm looking for an underground agent. One of ours or one of yours? And why the exposition hall at the coliseum? Who knows, you never know where you might find one. Be careful not to get picked up. Chief O'Hara can be very tough with aliens incognito. - Incognito? With my monocle? -Well, say hello to Colonel Hogan for us. It's no wonder he hasn't tried to borrow your Bat-rope to pull another one of his escapes. All right, now you folks keep your feet planted on the ground and nobody will end with their toes curled up, get it? Good. - What happened? Who did it? -Uh-- Uh-- Uh-- Which way did they head? What's he saying, Batman? Poor devil, he's in a state of shock, Shame must have just left. - Come on, Robin. -Where to? Through the window from whence we came. We must capture Shame. What's wrong, Batman? They've already attained a substantial lead over us, Robin plus, with the speed of that truck, we'll never catch them now. - And they have one great advantage over us. -Which is? They know where they're going. And they've already stolen a million, Unless we can employ some Bat-logic and figure out their scheme. - Let's see. Steers have to be fed, right? -Right. And it's not easy to hide four such enormous, well-known animals. - Right? -Right. They must've gone back to the Gotham City Stockyards, right? - Wrong. -Wrong. Wrong? If you wanted to hide a person, would you hide him in a crowd? - Right. -Right? It's easy to spot a person in a crowd. But it's not so easy to spot a person in some isolated spot where you wouldn't have looked. - Ergo? - Ergo Shame has probably taken those cows to the corral. Sound thinking, Robin. Call Commissioner Gordon on the Bat-telephone. Tell him to meet us there. Come back, Shame. Shame, come back. Shame. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at the Gotham City stockyards Shame and his evil cohorts are feeding the Black Angus cattle at the KO Corral. Well, I guess we're done did it, Laughing Leo. As soon as we get these critters fed and watered, we'll hightail it out of here. Hee-hee-hee! Every arch criminal in the east has been trying to outwit Batman for years. Ha-ha-ha! But it took a sun-tanned westerner to do the trick. - You said a snootful, Leo. - Mm! - Hey, boss, did you hear what I hear? -Huh? - Did you hear anything? -You hear anything? - What do you hear? -The Batmobile. That's what I hear. All right, now, take cover and this time, when you aim, aim to bleed. There it is, Batman, the KO Corral. - Let's go. -Steady, old churn. This could be a trap. - What do you think, Robin? -it's awfully quiet. Too quiet for my money. Don't make a move, Batman, or I'll fill you full of lead. You can't frighten us with a vague threat, Shame. For a smart hombre, you ain't got much savvy. This town ain't big enough for the both of us. Draw. You and every other criminal know that I don't carry firearms, Shame. Well, then, reach for your utility belt so as I can do you in. Even the rottenest cowboy wouldn't gun down two unarmed men. It's against the code of the old West. Them rules don't count east of the Mississippi. If you're gonna murder us, you're gonna have to do it without our aid. You may get two other notches in your gun, but it won't help your reputation one bit. That's enough, Batman. One more move and you'll look like a big blue lump of Swiss cheese. I got you covered six ways to Sunday. Look around. At the moment of truth, do exactly as I do. All right, fellows and gal, let them have it. What do we do when the smoke clears, they can draw a bead on us? - Shh, shh. I'm concentrating. - It's a heck of a time to be concentrating. Let's see, nine guns with six shots each, how many shots is that? - Fifty-four. - I counted 53. They're out of bullets. Now we'll see if you guys are as brave without guns for protection. Come on, Robin. Get them, Shame! Yippee! Yahoo! Ay! Ride him, cowboy. Ha, ha. You wouldn't hit a man with glasses, would you? Heh. - You're not wearing glasses. -Oh, I'm not? Laugh that off, Leo. Pardon me, ma'am. That's no way to prime a pump, Shame. Yeah, all right, partner, it were a fair and square fight, Batman. It was fair because you couldn't use your weapons. Great care must be taken in the use of firearms. They can be quite dangerous if used improperly. You said a mouthful. Shame, you just fired your last shot in Gotham City. All right, you thieving spalpeens, get going. Come on, into the wagon. All right, now, come on, hurry up. Let's go. You too, come on. Batman, you've done it again. May I shake your glove? - Of course, commissioner. -Ha, ha. And yours too, Boy Wonder. I must admit, we had a few tense moments with Shame. On the other hand, I knew you would bring him to justice. - Oh? -Well, don't you always? I like to think of you two as my own personal blessings in disguise. In a few minutes, the authorities will transport you all to the Calaboose. Well, I guess it's goodbye for 99 years to life. The law is the law. This little tyke insisted on coming in. Ha, ha. Ha, ha. Andy, what are you doing here? I've been yelling and screaming all over Gotham City for Shame to come back. When I heard that he was in here, I just reported myself as a lost little boy. - Why did you do that? -Because this dirty old man stole my radio and if Morn ever found out about it, she'd whale the tar out of me. Give me back my radio, Shame, or you'll be in big trouble with my mother. Here. Send me a bill for the batteries. Batman'll know my address. Well, what are you gonna do now, Andy? You're not really a lost little boy. I was for a while, Batman, but you made me find myself. I'm going straight to the departmental store and trading this western outfit for a Batman costume. I don't wanna be a cowboy anymore. I wanna be a hero like you, caped crime-fighter. Being a hero or a crime-fighter is not what counts the most, Andy it's growing up to be a good citizen, and if that's what you meant it's the highest possible compliment you could pay me. Good grief. 
NARRATOR". A glorious day for the annual luncheon of the Gotham City Charity Fund. Uh-oh. There's trouble on the wing. - Wait for me. - Help! Help! I'm being hijacked by Harry Hooligan! Please, won't somebody help me? Foul play in our fair city. That crooked quack is up to no good. Citizen Penguin to the rescue. You foul filcher. A feint. I'll teach you to prey on helpless Gothamites. Penguin, what's going on here? It's me you should be slugging. What? Citizen Penguin molest a minion of the law? That is inconceivable. Take care of this poor old man. The Penguin did what? Floored a thug who was holding up a blind news dealer? Was polite to a police officer? Saved a baby in a buggy from being hit by a truck? And then donated $100,000 to the Gotham City Charity Fund? You're absolutely sure it was the Penguin? All right, Simms. Keep an eye on him. - Did you hear all that, chief? -That I did, commissioner. Oh, that feathered fiend must be cooking up something pretty foul in his bubbling caldron. There's only one man capable of unraveling this tangled skein. Hark, is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, yet I see thee still. It's very nice that you're playing the lead in Macbeth, Dick but don't forget that you have a civics exam coming up. - Yeah. -Besides, Alfred may be getting uncomfortable. Oh, not at all, sir. I've always had a fondness for Shakespeare. One moment, sir. Yes, commissioner? I see. We'll be right down. Civics will have to wait, Dick. Penguin is up to some new tricks. Alfred, you may exercise your familiarity with the Bard. Did you hear those rumors in the lobby? The Penguin running for mayor. -It's a free country, Robin. -It won't be if he's elected. Besides, I thought convicted felons were barred from holding any official office. I suspect Penguin has done his civics homework well, Robin and has discovered that Paragraph 34-A of the city charter has never been officially repealed. It specifically allows convicted criminals to run for public office. Holy disaster area. I don't think there's any danger of the Penguin being elected, Robin. Hmm. The people of Gotham City are not as simpleminded as he might think. Thirteen, please. I'm glad you two are here, Dynamic Duo. I wanted a chance to say goodbye. I think you tend to overestimate the Penguin, Mayor Linseed. The Gotham City News Dealers' Association doesn't overestimate him. They endorsed him. Thanks to those shenanigans he pulled this afternoon. The same shenanigans got him the endorsement from the Gotham City Charity Fund. Not to mention the East Coast Bird Lovers' Society. - Commissioner? -Yeah. Bonnie. Send in Gallus, Rooper and Trendek. Gallus, Rooper, Trendek. - Take it away, C. F. -Thank you, E. G. Now, this is an accurate depiction of the Gotham City electorate as determined by our famous random sampling method. Result, 30 percent stated their preference for Mayor Linseed. - Sixty percent preferred the Penguin. -And 7 percent were undecided. What's the fourth line of the chart? Ah, yes. That represents two old ladies who are backing Harry Goldwinner, the monarchist candidate. And that, gentlemen, is the big picture. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have an appointment with the other candidate. Gallus, Rooper, Trendek. They're never wrong. It's hopeless. I can't possibly beat the Penguin. He'll use every underhanded political trick in the book. And he probably knows more underhanded tricks than even I know. It is true that the Penguin is somewhat devious in his methods, but-- No, Batman. I don't have a chance. - There's only one hope. -Yes? You, Batman. - Me? - Yes, Batman, you. You're the only one popular enough to stand a chance of beating that tricky bird. The mayor is right, Batman. The Penguin will try to smear whoever runs against him. You're the only man in Gotham City whose reputation is spotless enough to stand up against him. You've got to run, Batman. I can run as deputy mayor on the same ticket with you. It's the only way we can save Gotham City from the clutches of that feathered fiend. To run for mayor of a great American city like this one It's a great responsibility but am I worthy of it? If you're not, nobody is, Batman. Guardian of the people's trust No, no, I'm not worthy of it. You're the only man in Gotham City who is, Batman. - You've got to accept, Batman. -We're the representatives of the people. And we call upon you to save Gotham City from the horrible fate of the Penguin as mayor. Very well. I accept the call of the people. Hooray for Batman! Batman for mayor! - Hooray! Hooray! -Hooray! Ha, ha! NARRATOR". Not far away, at Penguin Campaign Headquarters Hey, Penguin, vote for him. All together! For he's a jolly good Penguin For he's a jolly good Penguin For he's a jolly good Penguin Which nobody can deny All right, back to work, everybody. When we're through with this campaign, even Mayor Linseed will vote for me. Gee, I wish I was old enough to vote for you, Mr. Penguin. Don't worry, little one, you'll get your chance on my fourth term. Quick, the latest figures. How much of a lead do I have in the polls? - None. -None? Well, just three hours ago you told me that I had 60 percent of the electorate. - That was a pre-Batman poll. -Since Batman announced his candidacy - Fifty-five percent favor Batman. Thirty-five percent favor the Penguin. Seven percent are undecided. And 3 percent are still backing Harry Goldwinner, the monarchist candidate. So old Pointy Ears has thrown his cowl into the ring, huh? Good. Once and for all, I'll settle matters with that masked moron. And when I finish with him he won't garner enough votes to be elected dogcatcher. Hold it. All workers double the assessments. Triple the size of the posters. Quadruple the number of campaign buttons. We'll give the voters of this city the kind of campaign that they want. Plenty of girls and bands and slogans and lots of hoopla. But remember, no politics. Issues confuse people. See, a big smile, hearty handshake, a very catchy campaign song. That's the way to win an election. Quack, quack, quack. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at Batman Campaign Headquarters Don't you think we should make them a little bigger, Batman? I think these are quite large enough, Robin. After all, the voters are interested in issues, not in window dressing. Sure, Batman, but a little showmanship wouldn't hurt us any. No, Robin. I wanna conduct a campaign that deals with the issues. I'm convinced the American electorate is too mature to be taken in by cheap vaudeville trickery. After all, if our national leaders were elected on the basis of tricky slogans brass bands and pretty girls our country would be in a terrible mess, wouldn't it? I'm sure you don't remember me, Batman. I'm Harriet Cooper, Dick Grayson's aunt. Of course I remember you, Mrs. Cooper. Welcome to campaign headquarters. Oh, you always say exactly the right thing. And I'm sure you're going to do exactly the right thing for the people of this great city: win the election and be an outstanding mayor. I'm going to try. The Penguin must be beaten at all costs. And I know costs run high in a political campaign. Perhaps this will help. Too generous. Not for such an important cause. This is just my little way of taking an interest in politics. As all good citizens should. - Thank you. -Bye. Bye. Holy bank balance. It's because of people like Aunt-- Mrs. Cooper that our cause must not fail, Robin. Mm. NARRATOR". And so the campaign begins. Hey, you, that's against the law. Well, chief, how does the campaign look to you? I just don't know, commissioner. At first I thought Batman was a shoo-in. But that blasted bird has put on a fantastic campaign. There's nowhere in Gotham City doesn't have one of his ugly posters. I just don't know, commissioner. Hi there. How are you? Hello, Batman. We came down for your rally, and we're with you all the way. - Thank you. I appreciate your support. -We brought our babies for you to kiss. - I'm afraid I can't do that. -What? It's a rather unsanitary habit, you see. Babies that small are very susceptible to germs. - My child, unsanitary? -That's not what I meant. A politician that won't kiss babies? That's outrageous. I admit it's rather unusual, but-- It's more than unusual. It's downright suspicious. It's more than suspicious. It's downright criminal. What can you expect from a fake politician like Batman? Well, little darling. Oh, little darling. There's the little darling. Where's the other one? Quack, quack. Let me see the other one. Oh! How could anyone not love such a sweet, darling, beautiful child as yours, madam? Anyone except Batman, that is. I'm giving him a little kissy-kissy. Don't tell me you good voters are going to go to the Batman rally. I wouldn't go to his rally if you paid me. The man's a child-hater. That's right. Down the block and to the right. The Penguin rally is in full sway. Count us in. You can't trust a guy who doesn't like kids. You slimy snake in the polls. That was a dirty, low-down trick. Right you are, Masked Muttonhead. It's one of my lowest. Politics is wonderful. I can use all my lowest, slurpiest tricks, but now they're legal. Oh, I should have been a politician years ago. Bear in mind, Robin that most politicians are honest servants of the people. The dishonest ones are the exception. As candidate for mayor of Gotham City I hope that this campaign will be a sober discussion of basic issues. I'm glad to see so many citizens who are concerned about their city's welfare and interested in its problems. I wish Batman would put a little more zip in his speech. - Chief. Chief. -Hmm-- Hmm? Huh? Oh. Sorry, commissioner. Couldn't you get Batman to agree to one little brass band? Batman feels that a political campaign should not be a vaudeville show, Mayor Linseed. But this isn't a political campaign. This is a funeral service. I know my opponent is having a rally down the street. I hope that he too will address himself to basic issues. Champagne for everybody. - Hooray for Penguin! -Hooray for Penguin! Hooray for me! Quack, quack. Vote for Penguin, yes, sirree He's the bird for you and me Clean up Gotham, one, two, three So cast your vote for Pengy Friends and fellow Gothamites The Penguin platform is simple Extremism in defense of vice Moderation in pursuit of virtue My friends, the Penguin Party stands for mother country the flag It's such a pleasure to hear plain, honest talk from a candidate instead of the usual political mumbo jumbo. --And class! Holy giveaways, Batman. No wonder we couldn't get anyone at our rally. Penguin was serving free champagne down the block. To each his own, Robin. Penguin depends upon the cynicism of the people while I depend on their good judgment. Let's just hope that I'm right. What's on our agenda for the rest of the day? You're scheduled to address two fraternal orders and a women's garden club. Which is first? The Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks. They called and asked you to speak to the members. The Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks I wonder if there's any particular significance to that name. After all, there's more to Penguin's caper than just running for mayor. If he wins, he'll bleed Gotham City dry. The Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks. Wanna feed it to the Bat Analyzer and see what we get? That won't be necessary, Robin. G-O-O-N. Welcome, Batman, to the Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks. Thank you. It's always a pleasure to talk to the voters. Our members can hardly wait. Those faces look awfully familiar, Batman. You're right, Robin. I recognize three of them from the Gotham City police files. - I smell a rat. -Two rats, Boy Wonder. Can you guess who the cats are? All right, Batman. Enough with the fancy umbrella play. Since you're so eager to discuss the weighty issues in the campaign, Batman we've fixed up a little surprise for you. Well, Batman, it looks like the Penguin put the election on ice, huh? What's going on here? This is outrageous. How dare you threaten the life of a political candidate? That's an outrage, I say. Oh. An outrage. Look at that. As the ice melts Batman and Robin will sink lower and lower into this vat. It's a vat of sulfuric acid. Ooh. How horrendous. I intend to summon the police this very instant. Uh Oh, dear me. I seem to have run out of dimes. Quack! How tragic. Well, don't fear, Batman. I shall run to the police station myself. If I hurry, I should be there in three or four hours at the most, hmm? I am off and running. Citizen Penguin to the rescue. 
Batman So far we have seen a giant sphinx a strange and terrible threat to Gotham City. Batman and Robin on the job. While a criminal king and his entourage hatch a fiendish plan. The dynamic duo tackle the sinister sphinx. A close shave. Signals from Nefertiti. King Tut's curse. The dynamic duo on Nefertiti's trail. A tricky asp. A king-size mummy come alive. A royal trap snap shut. Bruce in a blanket. . and another dish. A proclamation. . and an exclamation. Batman to the rescue. A daring escape. And a runaway stretcher. Great Scott, Bruce! Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na Batman Meanwhile, in the secret palace of King Tut on the outskirts of Gotham City the evil geniuses are all unaware that their victim has escaped. Hey, what's the big idea? I wish to peruse the news. There should be something about the Bruce Wayne kidnapping. Ladies and gentlemen, with Gotham City still reeling from the great sphinx mystery, another shocking blow has landed when Mr. Bruce Wayne, philanthropist and millionaire of our town was kidnapped in broad daylight. You know all that. Switch back to the sports. For the latest development in this fast-moving story we switch to mobile unit five station at Gotham City Police Headquarters. Come in, Commissioner Gordon. For the latest word on the Bruce Wayne kidnapping I'm proud to present my never-failing aid in the war against crimethe one and only, Batman. Thank you, commissioner. First I'd like to assure Mr. Bruce Wayne's many friends and associates that he is unharmed 'and will soon be returned home. ' What? Batman! He turns me on. Nefertiti, we could have you filleted for that. But he's so handsome and clean-cut, and groovy. We forbid you to speak well of our deadliest enemy. Astonishing news, Batman, but how do you know all this? Because I myself rescued Mr. Wayne 'not more than 10 minutes ago. ' That's a trick. You're lying, Batman. Where are my ministers? What's happened to those ninnies? 'Uh, in your expert opinion, Batman' 'what's behind all these mysterious occurrences?' In my expert opinion, commissioner we're seeing the dust of centuries blown away with a monstrous revival of a strange and ancient cult. - It's unearthly. - Perhaps. I'll know more, after I've dwelled into the secret archives of the antiquarian library in Alexandria. Alexandria? Oh, you mean the delightful suburb of Washington D. C. No, commissioner. Alexandria, Egypt. 'That ancient metropolis at the mouth of the River Nile. ' You're leaving for Egypt? 'By the first available jet. ' 'I have vital researches to perform. ' But, great Scott, Batman. What will become of us during your absence? Who will block the criminal schemes of this madman who calls himself King Tut? 'I pass the Egyptian ball to you, commissioner. In my. . ' He called me a madman, does he? We'll let's face it, Tut Tut. Face what, sweet, lovely Nefertiti? In the old days when you were professor at Yale before you got conked on the head in that student riot-- Royal torturers, servants of the fierce Jackal God of Anubis. To my bidding. . She's my subversive queen. To the dungeons with her! No! No! No! No! No! Mad am I? Well, you'll see while Batman is bouncing around in belfries in far off Egypt. I'll do what I set out to do before. I've got Bruce Wayne! Holy travel agent, Batman! - Are you really going to Egypt? - Of course not, Robin. It's merely a clever strategem I've worked out. I have a hunch King Tut will make another effort to kidnap Bruce Wayne. I get it, and we'll foil 'em, huh? On the contrary, I wish him to succeed. What? You're gonna let yourself be kidnapped? Yes, Robin. Yes and no. Before today's dark deeds unfold I want Aunt Harriet safely out of the way. Get on the phone. Call the house upstairs. Goodbye, Alfred. Now be sure Dick gets his warm milk before retiring, won't you? You may rest assured of it, madam. Just imagine, Alfred, a weekend in the country. Oh, it's going to be such a delightful change! Well, I better run, so the taxi man won't grow impatient. Gosh, Batman! That sure a lifelike dummy of Bruce Wayne. Hmm. It should serve the purpose. Deception and double deception. The only way to deal with a super criminal like Tut. Alfred? Oh, Alfred, have you seen the novel I've been reading anywhere? I. . Well, no, madam, I-I. . Oh, of course, I left it on the table. . Or the sofa. Mrs. Cooper, shh. Oh. Sweet dreams, Bruce dear. Phew! Holy, taxidermy. That dummy sure passed the test. 'Indeed, Robin. Cum laude. ' It's time to get set, Robin. It's almost oda wadda simba. - Almost what? - Oda wadda simba. In the 14th Dynasty the Hour of the Hyena. The time when ancient Egyptian super criminals invariably struck. Gosh, Batman, is there anything you don't know? Hmm. Oh yes, Robin. Several things in fact. All prepared, sir. Now the hyenas are at the gate. Who knows what form they'll take, Alfred. Can I help you? Sure you can. I've been sent over by the chief to watch over Mr. Wayne. In case those devilish kidnappers should try to strike again. Ah, yes. A wise precaution, officer. If you'll follow me. As you observe, the master's enjoying a moment's respite bit from the day's cares. 'Would the real almighty enjoy such fortune?' Don't worry, buster, it can be arranged. Extraordinary how that anti gas pill works. Shh. No one talk now. Quick! Take him to the royal barque. Wow! Worked like a charm. Batman, figured every move they make. I never doubted, but he would, Master Robin. What now? We track 'em on the bat-scanner to their criminal hideout. Quick, Alfred! You go to the service elevator. I'll meet you in the Bat-cave. Roger. 'Commissioner, this is Robin. ' Y-Yes, Boy Wonder. A-Okay, commissioner. They've got Bruce Wayne. Only it's really Batman, right? 'Right. ' Heartwarming indeed, Boy Wonder, the way a distinguished millionaire like Bruce Wayne cooperates in the fight against crime. Not all millionaires would be so self-sacrificing. I'll tell him you said so, commissioner. In the meantime standby with your full force. You're tracking the criminals, are you? Signals from the tiny homing transmitter in Batman's collar are coming in perfectly. I'll call you back when I learn about King Tut's hideout. Bless you, Boy Wonder. Chief O'Hara and I will stay by the Bat-phone. Look at them, Alfred. Tracking perfectly. Those poor demented felons. How little did they want? But they have a tiger by the tail. - Peculiar. - What? "Message of Anubis interprets itself as follows. "What seems is not, inside its bonds "the leopard has changed its spots. " Yeah. But then on the other hand. . there's no extra charge for making sure. 'Oh, glip! Cold as a cucumber. ' Could it be a defect in the receiver, Master Robin? Quick! Activate the emergency backup receivers. Roger. Emergency system at full gain. Holy high-flying! Something's gone wrong. Tick tock. Tick tock. Enjoying yourself, Batman? The dreaded ancient Theban pebble torture. - You pitiable madman. - Tick tock. Chief torturer, what's the pebble count on my faithless ex-queen? '901, Oh Great Pharaoh!' Less than 100 to go and then she'll smash herself to pieces trying to tear herself out of a jar. In the name of mercy, think back to the days 'when you were a distinguished professor at Yale University. ' Give yourself up. I vow that you'll receive the finest medical attention. Chief torturer, hold. What's the pebble count on Batman? '297, Oh Great Pharaoh!' Speed it up. Alfred, if we ever had need of our brain power it's now. Here are the last four fixes we've got. The problem is to extrapolate them. Project them to the criminal's putative destination. Correct, and if we extend their azimuth like this correcting from one way-- How peculiar. It leads us to this vacant area that coordinates 47 to 61. Wait a minute! Coordinates 47 to 61. Holy foxtrot! The Egyptian palace from last year's Gotham City exposition. Robin speaking. 'We've just had a message. ' King Tut is holding Batman is his secret hideout. He will exchange him for $1 million in cash. To be delivered personally by Bruce Wayne. You think it's on the level, commissioner? I do. But unfortunately I can't get a hold of Bruce Wayne. There's no answer at his stately mansion. Don't worry. I'm on my way to find him right this second. Goodbye, commissioner. Are you sure that was prudent, Master Robin? What, Alfred? Well, they're pretty certain of the whereabouts of King Tut's hideout. Should we not have informed the police and requested their aid? I didn't dare chance it. They're great guys, Alfred but they can be heavy-handed too and when those fiends have Batman. . I follow your thinking. The rude intrusion of the police might have provoked the criminals to some unhappy act of violence. Right, Alfred. This one we've gotta pull ourselves. - To the Batmobile. - To the. . Batmobile? But you don't have a license to drive, Master Robin. But you do. Twinkle twinkle little bat How I wonder what you're at Chief torturer, what's the latest pebble count? 'Coming down now, Oh Mighty Pharaoh. ' 'number 1000. ' Bring them to my throne room. Let it be a warning, loyal subjects. Our enemies shall be reduced even as these to mindless slaves. Smash open their cases. Dance, you slaves. Dance for our amusement! Music. Bat-music. Take him. Thought you unhinge, did you? I fooled you. I kept my reason by reciting the multiplication tables backwards. Hold on, Batman. I'm with you. Where is King Tut? Looks like he's gone, Batman. We'd better net him fast. The Batmobile, it's gone! Alfred, old fella, are you alright? Most remissive me, sir. I let that ruffian overpower me. Only one thing to do. Pursue him in this curious royal barque. Visual contact established. If he cuts into superpower afterburner we'll never keep up. Holy smoke! What'll we do now, Batman? Quick, hand me your tiny utility belt transmitter. Mine is disabled. I get it. You're gonna try to remote control Batmobile circuit via the Bat-cave relay link. Right, Robin, it's our only chance. Batman to Bat-cave. 'Voice control Batmobile relay circuit switch on. ' Batmobile ejection seat. Fire. What the heck! The failure signal. Circuits on the blink, I'm afraid. How can it be? Human mechanisms are made by human hands, Robin. None of them is infallible. It's a lesson which must be faced. - Hey, look! - 'He's coming back at us. ' What the heck! Look out, he's found the Bat-beam. Farewell. We rid Thebes forever of its rodents. Holy sky rocket! He hit the Bat-beam button and the ejector seat went off. Well hit, sir. Gosh! And to think he was once a famous professor in Yale University. That's life, Robin. Full of ups and downs. It'll be if it's any of us to grow too confident. A tragic case, Batman. One of the saddest which has ever crossed my ken. - There maybe hope for him yet. - But how? With proper treatment. Mental institutions are hopelessly overcrowded. The taxpayers are blind to our pleas. What about the Wayne Foundation? Gosh, yes! It's a great idea, Batman. But do you think Mr. Wayne'll go for it after being kidnapped by this devil? Chief O'Hara, I understand that Mr. Bruce Wayne is a man of great understanding and compassion. I'll phone Bruce Wayne instantly and ask him to come over here. - Watch out. - Argh! He's wakin' up. I-I must. . Young gentlemen rioting is not going. . Be careful. Ooh! Ohh! What an amazing dream. - I must be late for class. - Late for class? Yes. Egyptology. . Ohmy. . What is this? A miracle, professor. Simply a miracle. Oh. . Oh, whatever will the dean say? Next week the dynamic duo versus The Bookworm.

NARRATOR". When we last saw Robin the artful Joker had hung him on a gigantic Bat-Mobile along with dozens of giant palette knives, about to slice him to slivers with Bruce Wayne securely tied to a nearby chair in the monstrous mobile room of Joker's studio. In one moment, we'll find out whether Robin's saved or shaved. Bruce, you've got to do something. - These blades are getting lower and lower. -We've got one chance, Robin. If I can get to that governor and stop this creation of Joker's. You can do it, Bruce. Stick With it. I seem to have loosened one of these bonds. - Good work, Bruce. -Robin, work yourself loose. Disengage one of those knives and get down here. Quickly, disconnect the drive belt. That was close. Not much room for error. From now on, all the errors are on Joker. I think we'll prepare a little surprise for him, Robin. Soon Robin will be gone forever and I will be rich forever. When your priceless art treasures are delivered to me. Joker, you could at least untie us. My hands are getting stiff. Oh, but of course, my dear. The Joker is nothing if not magnanimous. How about me? Well, my generosity does not extended to overweight matrons, madam. Joker, that's not very nice. Well, we artists are not required to be nice. Only talented. Oh, speaking of which, my latest creation should have completed its work by now. What a beautiful sight. Beautiful. Oh, what magnificent, beautiful red blood Boy Wonder had. Has, Joker. That's not blood. That's some of your red paint. My beautiful red blood is still inside me, no thanks to you. Go! Get them! Aah! Baby Jane, those philistines in there intend to do me bodily harm. You've got to stand by me. After you tied me up and tried to steal my art collection? But I couldn't help myself, my dear. I'm an artist. Oh, I have a desire for things of beauty. Beauty's irresistible to me. Oh, that's why I'm so attracted to you, my dear. - Really? -Oh, I swear it, on a stack of blue boys. Thank you. But I had to let him knock me around a little bit. We don't want these crooks to make any connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Gosh, that's right, but it's sure a tough way to throw them off the track. Fortunately, I'm in good condition. But we still have to round up the leader of these artistic failures. Come on. I did it all for art, Baby Jane. All for art. Can you doubt that I'm a great artist after seeing my paintings? Your paintings were impressive, Joker. Certainly not the work of an ordinary mind. Aah! Stay away from me. That juvenile delinquent has no appreciation for fine art. - Baby Jane, you're not going to protect him. -He's just a misguided artist, Robin. And we're going to re-guide him, straight to the Gotham State Penitentiary. But the art collections haven't been delivered yet, so he hasn't stolen anything. And as for the kidnapping, I for one refuse to press charges. And as for them, they're all worn out from climbing the social ladder. While I alone, with my filthy rich Daddy's money and prestige am in a position to keep them from reaching the top. Well, I certainly wouldn't press charges, Baby Jane. It won't help you, Joker. Bruce Wayne will press charges. - He was born on top of the social ladder. -Yes, I am reasonably secure socially. However, if Baby Jane thinks the Joker is simply misguided I must defer to her judgment. You're a sweetie, Brucie. And now I have my very own artist to play with. - I am at your command, my dear. -Come on, you big hunk of genius. Ta-ta, Boy Bungler, and tell your chicken-hearted partner that if I catch him on the street, I'll run him out of town. Ha-ha-ha! - Why didn't you press--? -Let's untie the ladies first, Boy Wonder. Oh, thank you so much, Robin. Mr. Wayne, thank you. Why didn't you press charges? It's dangerous. You and I have been seen together often enough as it is. Letting him go. He's not only free, but he thinks Batman's afraid of him. Don't worry, Joker won't be under that delusion for long. NARRATOR". Presently in the handsome mansion of Baby Jane's filthy rich father Do have some more chicken, Joker. You need your strength. I could exist on two grapes and a thimble of water. But my muse, my muse is starving. More chicken for the Joker's muse. Tell me, Joker, where do you get your ideas for your paintings? Ah, inspirations, my dear, from my muse and from beautiful admirers. If only I could feel that I'd inspired a great work of art. Oh, don't worry, my dear. You Will, you will. Ah! A message from my muse. - What does it say? -Ah! Clear the table. - Paint. Bring me paint. -Charles, you heard the Joker. Never mind, I brought my own. Ha-ha-ha. Ah, yes. Thank you. Ha-ha-ha. Whoo! Ah, ha-ha-ha. Oh, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Whoo! Oh, magnificent, magnificent. Magnificent. Look at that. Magnificent. Never seen anything so beautiful in my life. What a magnificent artist I am. Ooh, a veritable masterpiece. All right, boys, go to work on it. But, Joker, that's a priceless antique table. Out with the old, in with the new. - Joker, they're destroying it! -Oh, not destroying, my dear. Creating. Look at it this way. You're not losing a table, you're gaining a masterpiece. - I see you removed the stain, Alfred. -Yes, sir. The Batnaphtha finally did the trick. Now I can start returning the signs I removed from the Bat-poles. What about removing Joker? We must anticipate Joker's next move and be there waiting for him. How can you predict what a kook like that will do? The criminal mind, erratic as it is, nevertheless has certain characteristic patterns. For instance, Joker has begun an artistic caper. I suspect he'll continue it. And he can count on Baby Jane Towser's help. Yes, I'm afraid he's completely bamboozled that poor girl and I'm sure he'll try to use her. The question is, how? Think of it, my dear. You'll be tell your grandchildren that you witnessed the turning point of 20th century art. These paintings should be in the Louvre. Or in the Gotham City Museum. There's no room in the Gotham City Museum. It's filled up. Yes. And with what? A lot of dusty relics of the past. Outworn and outmoded. No, we'll go down there tonight and replace those old relics with my brand new paintings. - But we can't do that, Joker. -Why not? Don't you think my paintings are good enough? After all, they were once your very valuable antique dining table. Of course your paintings are marvelous, but-- Then it's all settled. I happen to know that your filthy rich daddy has a special founder's key to the Towser Wing of the museum. -Yes, he does, but-- Do you want your genius, me, to find another inspiration? Oh, no. Joker, I must always be your inspiration. Then go get Daddy's key. The Towser Wing of the museum is being renovated this week. Which will make it all the easier for us to make our little, uh, exchange. Alfred should be finished shortly, Robin, and we can put our little plan into effect. The Batphone. - Yes, commissioner. -The Joker's been too quiet, Batman. I'm worried. A whole day and nothing's happened. That larcenous phony has something under his hat besides his head. - Yeah. - The chief is right. Robin and I would like to handle this ourselves. Especially since Joker has been spreading ugly rumors about me. Whatever you think best but no one could believe for a second that you're afraid of that cackling cutpurse. Thank you, commissioner. The chief and I won't move until we hear from you. I hope that won't be too long, commissioner. And tell Chief O'Hara that Robin and I have something in our pockets besides our hands. Right. I'm all through, sir. Let's have a look, Alfred. I've done my best. Fine, Alfred. NARRATOR". And that night in the Towser Wing of the Gotham City Museum There. Now all the world can see what a genius I am. - And what an inspiration I am and my table. -Oh, of course, my dear. Joker, what are you gonna do with all the dusty old relics that used to hang here? Ah, that junk? I'll take it to the city dump and burn it. Now, be a good girl and go and get another one of my masterpieces. Careful, you dolt. Those paintings are priceless. How many are left? - This is the last one, Joker. -Have you loaded them onto the truck? All but this one. Where should we take them? To the last place where the Gotham City Police expect us to go. - Our old studio. -Right. Ha-ha-ha! Get going, boys. - Here's another masterpiece. -Ah! Won't the museum directors be surprised? Ooh! Hoo, hoo! They'll be overjoyed, my dear. Let me see that. There's a good place over there. Handle them carefully, boys. There's 10 million under those blankets. Well, I can't understand you, my dear, if you mumble. Well, you're almost as bad as my muse. I could never understand her either. Well, art styles change, but crime goes on forever. Is that why I'm tied up? After all I've done for you? Been your biggest booster? Friendship ends when real felony finally takes over. Ha, ha. Mm. Keep an eye on her. - Commissioner Gordon. - Working nights, commissioner? - Joker. -Joker? I've decided to give you a present, commissioner for being so nice to me all these years. If you're trying to offer me a bribe, Joker A bribe? Oh, don't be ridiculous. I intend to present you with the entire Renaissance collection of the Gotham City Museum as a gift. Renaissance art collection? How did you--? Never mind how, commissioner. I've got it and I'm giving it to you. Now, isn't that nice of me? Of course there's a slight delivery charge, about $10 million. Payable within an hour or I burn the entire collection. When Batman gets his hands on you Batman? Ha! That Cowardly Creep? He's so scared of me he doesn't dare come out of his Batcave. You might as well forget help from Batman, commissioner and start thinking of my 10 million. - Good evening, Joker. -Oh! Oh, Batman, you're on the line too. Well, ha-ha-ha. - Oh, hiding out in the commissioner's office? -I hope you don't mind, Joker. Oh, you better stay inside, Batboob, because if I catch you outside I'm going to pin your pointed ears back, do you hear? Of course, Joker. What's this I hear about stolen paintings? Oh, I have dozens of them, and each one an old master. - You don't say. -Yes, I do say. You Caped Clotpoll. You switched paintings on me. These are nothing but kindergarten drawings. Naturally. And even a kindergarten mind could have anticipated your every move. This caper was even more obvious than most. You can say that over the phone, Batman, but if I had you here, I'd pound you to a pulp. Start pounding, Joker. It's music to me ears. It is, Chief O'Hara. It is indeed. Beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, it's horrible, horrible. Oh, while the Dynamic Dimwits are flapping my flunkies, I'll make my escape. But first a trip to Bruce Wayne's house to pick up some quick cash so I can hide out for few months. And get even with that rich fink for quitting my kidnap keeper this morning. He's gone. Knowing the Joker's need for cash and his dislike for Bruce-- - You think he's headed for Wayne Manor? -I'm sure of it. Come on, to the Batmobile. - Where's Bruce Wayne? -Mr. Wayne is not at home, sir. Too bad. I'll get my revenge later. Right now, I'll settle for cash. Where's the safe? My duties do not include aiding and abetting thievery. Oh, no? - I see. -Ha-ha-ha. This way, sir. Please be calm, madam. One peep out of you and I'll blow your head off. - Where's the safe? -Over there. - Oh, my, you poor little thing. -Behind the picture, sir. There's no safe there. Aah! Alfred, be careful. The Joker's an arch-criminal. - I know, madam, but a very poor fencer. -You Anglo-fink, I'll smash you to smidgens. May I point out that smidgens is a childish effusion which should have no place even in so poor a vocabulary as yours, sir. Stand back. Stand back, I say, or I'll - Aah? What's this? -Don't touch that. Ah, ha! A secret passage. - Alfred, what's happened? -The Joker tripped the Bat-pole switch and mistook this for a secret passage. -He's down in the Batcave. He didn't quite make the Batcave, Master Robin. - Then where is he? -I believe he should be arriving presently. Emergency Bat-pole elevator. Fast thinking, Alfred. Thank you, sir. Someone get me off this crazy dumbwaiter. I can't breathe! Joker says he can't breathe, Alfred. Why don't you give him some breathing space? With pleasure, sir. Oh, no! Aah! It's lucky you didn't get around to washing our other costumes or Joker might have found himself wearing a Bat-costume. I think we better see about Baby Jane Towser. Alfred, it looks like you can handle things. I believe everything is well in hand, sir, and the young lady's in the living room. Now, now, Ms. Towser, it wasn't your fault. Anyone could be misled by the Joker's slick talk. But I was so gullible, Mrs. Cooper. Oh, Batman and Robin, thank heaven you're here. - Is Alfred all right? -Yes, he's just fine, Mrs. Cooper. Batman, I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. It was an honest mistake, Baby Jane. No one blames you for it. I blame myself. It'll be a long time before anyone catches me in another art gallery. It'll be an even longer time for Joker. - By the way, where is Joker? -Right now, Joker's having his ups and downs. You might say that. Help! Alfred, old pal, have pity. Ho-ho-ho! We Anglo-finks have a long memory. I really shouldn't take pleasure in another creature's misfortunes but, uh, occasionally one may be forgiven for a slight twinge of satisfaction. Of course, there's no telling what the public is going to like, you know? Personally, I never understood modern art. I've always liked Whistler's Mother. - To tell the truth, so have I. -Shh! Someone might hear you and you'd lose a fortune. Which would decrease the proceeds to the Wayne Foundation Free-Nursery School to which Alfred is donating his profits. -It is the least I could do, sir. Especially in view of the, uh, nature of the paintings. Excuse me, I think I see a customer ripe for plucking. I mean, interested in buying. I don't understand it at all. It must be very profound. Notice the large green blob. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. Very profound. Well, Alfred, it's not everyone who can have his first efforts displayed at Park's. Thank you, sir. The Joker and his paintings are in prison and Alfred and his paintings are at Park's. A rather nice turn of events. - And very fine paintings they are too, Alfred. -You really think so, sir? Oh, indeed I do. Why, uh, they're masterpieces. Perhaps you'd like to own one. Yes, yes, I would, but, uh, I can't afford the price. Oh, that's no obstacle, sir. Allow me to present you with this one as a token of my esteem. Mother machree. 
NARRATOR". A picturesque day in Gotham city. Even more picturesque than usual. And in one of the many picturesque art galleries where culture-loving Gothamites gather Are you interested in purchasing the painting, sir? Not for myself. But my employer, millionaire Bruce Wayne is very interested in acquiring an original Muzzy. Oh, you don't say. Well, then perhaps you'd like to meet the artist himself. - It would be a pleasure. -No sooner said than done. This way. - Mr. -- -Alfred will do. Mr. Alfred, allow me to present Mr. Oliver Muzzy, beloved American artist. It's an honor. Hey, this an outrage. An outrage against art. An insult, I say. Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ugliness, monstrosity, horribility. Ha, ha. Look at that. You call that art? And this thing. Pah! Disgusting. Oh, ho, ho. And this, worse and worse. Oh, this ugliness must be destroyed. Ha, ha. Down with ugliness. Away with dullness. Take this. Take this and that. Ha-ha-ha! Take that. Take that. Fiend. Monster. I'd appreciate your mentioning it to Mr. Wayne at once. - All right, Alfred. I'll tell him right away. -Thank you, madam. Take that, take that and that. Aunt Harriet. Oh, Bruce, Alfred just called from the Park gallery. He's found a painting he thinks you'll be very interested in. - Mm-hm. -it's called, uh, "The Laughing Man. " Well, that sounds very interesting, Aunt Harriet. Dick and I will go down and have a look at it now. Oh, I do hope you like it, Bruce. - The Laughing Man? -That's Alfred's way of telling us that one of Gotham City's arch villains is at Park Gallery right now. Holy tip-off, Joker. Exactly, and I think you better continue your education at the Park Gallery as Robin. To the Bat-poles. What happened to the signs, Bruce? Alfred removed them to put a new coat of paint. Good old, Alfred. - Batman. Thank heavens. -Unh! Stay back, you caped clunk-heads or I'll turn you into a paisley shawl. From the stains on your gun barrel, I'd say you're using very soft bullets these days. Ugh. Internal injuries. I'm going to die. I hope you do, you finagling fiend. Batman, did you see what he did to the pictures? Priceless works of art destroyed forever. Think of the loss to posterity and the loss to my profits. Yes, the damage is irreparable. But at least you can be sure the Joker won't be doing any more decorating for a long time. He's destroyed the work of America's most beloved artists. Shut up, you bubbling buffoon. I have been trying to paint this modern stuff for years. I could never get the hang of it. All I could ever draw is stupid looking farm boys and puppy dogs. Now this, ha, ha, this is art. Mr. Joker, let me congratulate you. Your work is magnificent. Holy hoaxes. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, well, excuse my appearance, Mr. Muzzy but, yes, these uncultured boobs have no appreciation for fine art. Obviously. By the way, Mr. Joker, would you consider sharing the credits for those paintings? - After all, mine are underneath. -Why not? Ha, ha! A 50-50 split. I mean co-authorship. Oh, thank you, thank you. Peasant. Philistine. Ha-ha-ha. Well, what can you expect from a man who appears in public in such a ridiculous outfit? There, Batman, now you're wearing an original Joker, signed by the artist. Ha-ha-ha! Come, boys. Let's leave this zoo full of bourgeois baboons. And henceforth, Batman, stay out of art galleries, hmm? Ooh, ha-ha-ha! Are we just going to let him walk out of here? We have no choice, Robin. He's committed no crime. As a matter of fact, he's increased the value of these paintings. I think we should discuss this with Commissioner Gordon. The nerve of that clown. Paint all over your shirt. Batman, you should have cracked his pate for him. His damage to me is unimportant, Chief O'Hara. What concerns us is his potential damage to Gotham City. I'm sure Joker has some larger scheme of which this only the first step. You're right, Batman. That crook has something up his sleeve besides his elbow. I'd suggest putting some extra guards at all the museums, commissioner. What about some of the valuable private collections? Right, Boy Wonder. You keep them under close surveillance, Chief O'Hara. I'll watch over them like a mother hen, commissioner. That's about all we can do until Joker makes a move. To the Batcave, Robin. I'm sorry about not having a clean costume, sir. I meant to wash them, but I've been so busy trying to get the Bat-poles repainted. First things first, Alfred. Batman, there's an interesting notice in the current issue of the Gotham City Art News. Mm. That is interesting. - Yes, commissioner. - A bit of news, Batman. Believe it or not, the Joker has been invited to enter the Gotham City International Art Contest. Yes, I just found out about it myself. I plan to have 50 plainclothesmen at the contest, Batman. That's likely to put Joker on his guard, commissioner. Perhaps it would be wiser to plant just one man there. Preferably a man who knows Baby Jane Towser the wealthy young socialite who organized the contest. Yeah, I've got it. Bruce Wayne, the millionaire philanthropist. He's cooperated with us many times in the past and travels in the same social circles as Towser. Excellent idea, commissioner. I suggest that you call Mr. Wayne immediately and apprise him of the situation. Right, Batman. Why is Joker entering that contest? Especially since they're not offering a cash prize. NARRATOR". And so the next day at the Gotham City Art Center Ladies and gentlemen before we begin Gotham City's International Art Contest I'd like to introduce the five world famous artists who are competing. The renowned Spanish artist, well known for his pink and blue periods Mr. Pablo Pincus. I'm sure you all know our American artist, Mr. Jackson Potluck. The noted Italian artist painter of the world famous fresco Midnight Snack Leonardo Davinsky. And the Dutch artist, founder of the Neo Gamon School of Art Mr. Vincent Van Gauche. And now, finally, Gotham City's own entry in the art contest the Joker. How can they clap for that crook? Don't forget, Dick, this is a hometown crowd and Joker is from Gotham City. The artists have three minutes to complete a painting. At the end of that time, the judges will select a winner and award the grand prize. Ready, artists? On your mark, get set Modern art tends to be rather unrestrained, Dick. - Unrestrained? -Yes. Governor Stonefellow should declare this place a disaster area. -Isn't it magnificent? -Glorious. Joker, the time is almost up and you haven't started your painting. Started? My dear, I've almost finished. Oh, yes, every line in place, every color balanced. Just needs one more little touch. Now, gentlemen, let us consider the works of these marvelous artists. Interesting use of color. A fine example of, uh, neorealism. Ah. Excellent harmonic composition. A fine study in abstract. What is that? My painting is titled, Death of a Mauve Bat. Where is the bat? Well, the bat, gentlemen, is dead. It died in 1936, a very bad year for bats. Of course, the bat is dead. It's symbolic. Symbolic of what? The emptiness of modern life. What else? Gentlemen, come with me. There's absolutely no doubt about who the winner is. - I kind of like what the monkey did. -I think our decision should be unanimous. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very pleased to announce that the winner of the Gotham City International Art Contest is the Joker. Joker's painting, Death of a Mauve Bat will hang in an honored place in the Gotham City Museum. - I don't believe it, Bruce. -As winner of the grand prize I would like to announce the opening of a new school for aspiring artists where I personally will instruct my students in the secrets of modern art. Yes, applications for the Joker Art Institute are now being accepted by my assistants. Sorry, millionaires only, please. I want to be the very first student in your art school you big hunk of genius, you. Well, of course, my dear. Your filthy rich daddy is several times a millionaire, I believe. Oh, yes, I'm the heiress to the paperclip fortune, you know? Oh, well, sign right here, please. I begin to see Joker's plan. He wins the contest so he can start an art school. In which he enrolls only millionaires. In which case, he should welcome millionaire Bruce Wayne as a student. Joker, I'd like to enroll in your new art institute. Well, if it isn't billionaire, Bruce Wayne, the wealthy philanthropist. Consider yourself enrolled. Aren't you going to give me a test to see whether I have talent? Oh, the rich, the well-born and the able, Mr. Wayne, all have talent. Especially the rich. We're getting a good strong signal from that homing device Bruce has in his pocket. The Bat-radarscope indicates that he's at Location RIP-478. - Please check that on the Batcomputer, Alfred. -Very good. Location RIP-478 is a building on Eleanor Place. Bruce is carrying a miniature Bat-communicator under his jacket lapel. He'll let us know if Joker tries anything. Good morning, dear students. Good morning. My, but it's good to see you all working so diligently. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, we are a happy cheery group, aren't we? Oh, today's lesson is in still-life sculpture. I shall walk around you and give you my criticism as you work. Oh, very good, Mrs. Putney. Very good. Oh, but this orange is not quite right. Oh, Joker, that's not an orange. It's a pear. Oh, but of course, Mrs. Putney. Of course. Ha-ha-ha. Well, keep up the good work. Ooh, ha, ha! Well, you're making splendid progress, Mrs. Van Dormer. Yeah. Ew. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, yes, now stick to it. Stick to it. Well, now, barbed wire is the medium of the future, Mrs. Runcilmeyer. But that is no way to make a banana. Now that is a banana. Baby Jane? Baby Jane? - How do you like my work? -Oh, fine. First rate. Fruitiest sculpture I ever saw. But I'm not sculpting the fruit. I'm sculpting you. - Me? -Didn't you recognize it? Oh, but of course I recognize it. Ha-ha-ha. I just didn't realize I was so handsome. Ew. Well, that's terrible. Terrible, Wayne. Why, even a 3-year-old could do better than that. Here, let me show you. - Oh, there. That's more like it. Ha, ha. -Yes, I see what you mean. That's about the level of a 3-year-old. I do the jokes around here, Wayne. I'd say that was one of your better ones. Oh, you're very funny, Wayne. But the joke's on you. Come in, boys. No heroics, Wayne, or the women might get hurt. I should have known someone like you would hide behind the women. - Joker, how could you? - Ah, tut, tut, my dear. We artists should not be judged by ordinary standards. We're a very special breed. You're a special breed, all right. Oh, button your lip, Wayne, or you'll be buttoning your shroud. You'll all be happy to learn ransom notes have already been sent to your families. You each own a valuable renaissance art collection which will be delivered to me in exchange for your lives. Tie them up. Something's wrong, Alfred. It's not like Joker to go this long without trying some underhanded trick. - Yes, commissioner? - Oh, Boy Wonder? I'm afraid we've put our friend, Bruce Wayne, in terrible danger. Joker's kidnapped the art class and sent out ransom notes. - We don't even know where he's holding them. -Holy hostage. I think Batman and I can find him, commissioner. - Will you need help? -We can handle it. If the police show up, innocent people might be hurt. Something must have happened to Bruce's Bat-communicator, Alfred. I'd better get down to Joker's studio right away. You stay here and watch the Bat-radarscope in case Joker moves while I'm en route. I'll take the emergency Bat-tunnel. It comes out on Highway One and I can catch a bus to Gotham City. Your families had better send the loot pretty soon or you'll all find yourself at the bottom of the river. Even me, Joker? Oh, I'm sorry, my dear, but business is business. Mm. And as for you, Wayne, I hope your family doesn't deliver. I'd enjoy dropping you in the drink. Ha-ha-ha! I hope you're better at that than at painting. Oh, you go too far, Wayne. You go too far. - Joker. -What? The nerve of that rich smart aleck, thinking he could match wits with me, the Joker. - Why ain't Batman here, Joker? -Because he's afraid of me, you dolt. Yes, I knew the day would come when his spine would turn to Bat-jelly. Yes, I'm only sorry he isn't here to enjoy a special surprise I cooked up for him. Yes. But Bruce Wayne will do as a substitute. I'm beginning to dislike him as much as Batman. My newest artistic creation, the Mobile. Too bad that chicken-hearted Batman isn't here to die on it. Batman is no more afraid of you than he is a flea. And I know Batman well enough to be sure of it. Ah, no use trying to alibi for him. The Caped Crusader has turned Cowled Coward. Yes. Ha-ha-ha. And you'll soon discover that the Mobile is very mobile. Yes. As soon as I leave here, I will activate a motor that will start it rotating. Yes. Let's see how long you can dodge these razor sharp palette knives, Boy Bumpkin. Holy hamburger, I'll be cut to pieces by these blades. Stay with it, old chum, while I try to loosen these ropes. But by the time you're free, there'll be nothing left of me. 
Batman So far we have seen at the dedication of a new bridge. Murder. And spotted in the crowd, that sinister crook, The Bookworm. Great Scott! A Bookworm ploy. A ruse to divert the Dynamic Duo while a bomb was placed in the Bat-mobile. Bomb detected. Ejected. A clue. He was going to blow up the bridge. He did. he blew it up. Into a giant photograph. Like moths, our heroes followed the light. Into a Bat-trap. Was this girl really a prisoner? Was it a trick? One way to find out. Put her gently to sleep. Spirit her into the Bat-cave. Test her. Counter plot. Pretend we fall for her game. The tricky girl turned the tables. And The Bookworm knew just what to do with him. Bind him to the clapper of a giant bell. Do not ask for whom this bell tolls. It tolls for Robin. In just one minute, a stroke of midnight doom. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na na Batman A few minutes earlier, even as Bookworm binds Robin to the clapper of the giant bell Batman races across Gotham City in the opposite direction. Hot on a trail that's fatally false. What's up, Chief O'Hara? We've searched that hall from cellar to weathervane. Not a trace of The Bookworm. - But how can that be? - Oh, worse news, too, Batman. You know that alley way where you said we'd find The Boy Wonder? - A-guarding Bookworm's ma? - Yes. Yes. - Don't tell me! - You guessed it. Great heavens! I better try to contact Robin instantly on the utility belt wavelength. Robin. Robin? Do you receive me? Robin! Over. The tricky devils. They've turned the tables and caught Robin. I'll call headquarters. Throw out the drag net. No, wait a minute, Chief O'Hara. Let meturn my memory back. "He strikes at midnight. . " she said. But we know the Bookworm's changed his plan. Don't interrupt! I'm trying to fathom the sub-conscience of a deadly criminal! "He strikes at midnight. " A metaphor. . suggests a clock. A clock called He? Of course! And there's only one clock in Gotham City that is called He. Saints alive! Big Benjamin. In the Wayne Memorial clock tower. And it fits in with the plan. "Do not ask for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee. " You mean? Exactly! And if my surmise is correct. . the ghastly fate that Bookworm planned for me he's twisted to Robin. Chief O'Hara, we haven't one Big Benjamin second to lose! Mere seconds before he strikes. I'll shoot out the works. Ah, didn't even dent it. No time for a Bat-climb. We have one last desperate chance. Help me setup the Bat-zooka. The lightning rod on top. Fire! Bullseye. Second shot, the hands of that clock. Fire! Mother McRee. Done it again. Quickly. Now, to get the ends of these two conductive lines. What are you doing, Batman? Attaching these lines to the nuclear power source. Both lines to the positive terminal. As you may recall from school like charges of electricity repel each other. Now, to rev up the power turbines. I still don't get it, Batman. Pray! Pray, Chief O'Hara. . that the clapper and the bell will be positively charged. And thus repel each other! I hope so, Batman. I hope so! Funny, all I hear is a nightingale. Inconceivable, but true. The precocious pest has escaped us. But how could he, Bookworm? - How could he? - How could he? I can not conceive, but from Gill Blas translated by Tobias Smollett book 10, chapter three. . quote "Facts are stubborn things. " Unquote. Now the fact is. . that our bats have flown the belfry unaccountably still squeaking. Gee. And us, with our super-crime not pulled yet. Ha! Do not fret, my sweet Lydia. Oh, do not fret. My brain drenched mind has done it again. A most delicious Bat-trap. Mwah! And in Wayne Manor, stately home of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson the plot is about to take a strange new twist. Oh, what is it, Alfred? It's a gentleman from the book mobile service, madam. Oh, how nice? Bring him in. This way, sir. How do you do? What do you recommend this week? Something for reading before going to sleep. Oh, well, I believe you will find this volume extremely effective, Mrs. Cooper. Congressional record, March 1919? Oh, it's the illustrations, Mrs. Cooper. They are so picante. Oh, you don't say. Look, Alfred. Hmm. . Oh. Subject found to be member of. . Yes, Commissioner? Uh, Bookworm has struck again, Batman. Brazenly. 'Where?' The mansion of millionaire, Bruce Wayne. He stole a single volume. A priceless first edition cookbook. Well, is anyone in the Wayne household hurt? Fortunately, no one. Goodbye, Commissioner, I'll be at Wayne Manor faster than anyone can imagine. - That's not the only thing. - 'What else?' In the middle of the street at Cedar and Fifth there's been a sudden monstrous apparition. 'The biggest cookbook anyone ever saw. ' Goodbye, commissioner. - Aunt Harriet and Alfred? - They're not hurt, he said. Our duty is to the public. Let's go! What a twisted scale of events. Typicalof the frustrated author Bookworm is. Over plotting. 'Either the robbery or a giant cookbook' would have attracted our attention. Foolish amateur. Has to try both. Holy toad! Back, everybody! Back! Back! Take cover at the side streets. Take cover at the side streets! The recipes in this book could be explosive. Stay back. I bet it's hollow inside, Batman. We'll soon find out. Let's probe it with our high energy radar. Roger! 'Hollow, alright. ' Yes. Judging from the rate of reflection the cover contains high tensile steel. - Let's open it up, Batman. - Right you are. If the cover contains steel we can do it from a safe distance using the super powered Bat-magnet. Great. - I'll work the power supply. - Roger. Bat-pull, 1200 pounds. Make it a ton. Oh, poor puny little bat-brains. I bet they think they opened that book. But will they go in? Of course, they'll go in. In the words of the poet. . "Curiosity killed the bat. " Ordinary paper. It must cover the hollowed out part. I wonder what's on the menu inside. Only one way to find out, Robin. Let's take a bite. Smells like soup. Darn good soup. Right you are. Bat-soup. 'And in you go. ' Holy stew pot! 'Bookworm to Batman. ' He's got this place wired. I'll bet he's watching and listening, too. Well, of course, I'm listening. 'Bookworm, what are you up to?' It's a curious old recipe I discovered in the alchemist cookbook, Vienna, dated 1534. 'How to steam a bat. ' I think he means it. 'Of course, I mean it, Boy Wonder. ' 'Watch now, while I turn up my radio controlled double boiler. ' Double for Dynamic Duo. 'Cook well, my bat-eared friends. 'While you are stewing down, I shall be pulling off' 'the crime of the century with the aid of your Bat-mobile. ' Happy juices. Quick, let's fly. Batman to Gotham City police. Batman to Gotham City police. Red alert. Red alert. We're trapped inside a cookbook at Fifth and Cedar. Red alert. Do you receive me? Over. No answer. These high tensile steel walls they're cutting down our transmission. I'll get out my laser beam cutting torch. Don't, Robin. No, no. It would super heat the steam and boil us in a split second. Holy pressure cooker! Only way to crack this thing would be the Bat-beam in the Bat-mobile and Bookworm has it. We even left the engine running. 'With all your might and mane, men. Let's go!' They'll never get to us in time. There's only one hope. - Well? - We're getting nowhere, Chief. Oh, harder, fellas. Harder! Oh, give me, give me that sledge, here. Sounds like steam in there. Drats ! That fine pair of crime fighters boiled in the entrails of a monster cookbook. Who could imagine a more tragic end? Batman to Bat-cave. What's the use, Batman? It's just possible our own supersensitive antenna may pick up the signal where the police receivers could not. Do you think Alfred's there? He's a creature of well disciplined habits. It's his regular time for dusting the Atomic Pyle. Batman to Alfred. Batman to Alfred. This is an emergency. Might I be of some assistance, sir? Quick, Alfred. Point me into the voice actuated circuit of the master anti-crime computer. Certainly, sir. At once, sir. Bookworm to Bookmobile. Bookworm to Bookmobile. Do you read me? 'Devil to Bookworm. I read you. ' Rendezvous. The rear of the Morgan Bilt library. Over and out. The Morgan Bilt Library? But that's uncrackable. It's defied every burglar in the country. Yes. Yes, yes, my sweet Lydia. Yes. But they did not have the use of the Bat-beam. Plans and views. Folio, 369. Operate, cross-read. I'm weakening, Batman. Hold on, Robin. Hold on, hold on, I'm getting the answer I expected. Answer? About the source of the steam. Plans and views, cutout, feedback circuit three, operate. Who's the best safe cracker in our files? Uh, The Riddler. Well, send a helicopter to state penitentiary and have him brought here. - Yes. . - Alright, everybody down! Go on! Get them down! Ready? Fire! Good grief! We're too late. Gone! Consumed, I fear. Totally consumed in this diabolical hell's kitchen. The Morgan Bilt Library. Unparalleled repository of literary treasures. In an alley at the rear, there are little foxes in the vines. Directly ahead through that wall, the air conditioned vault containing treasures beyond imagination. Oh, some hall, alright. Seven Gutenberg Bibles. Eleven First Folio's by William Shakespeare Some wall, too. Three feet of cement over 18 inches of steel. Ah, to the Bat-beam. But what if something goes wrong, Bookworm? Oh, it won't, it won't. It won't. "Best laid plans of mice and men. " I don't know where it's from. But I know it's true. Schemes. Schemes. Schemes. "The best laid scheme. . " Robert Burns, "To a mouse", stanza seven. Schemes. You are graded C minus. Now, for the Bat-beam. Oh! Melting. Fantastic. My fine twisty worms, follow me. They'll follow you, Bookworm. Right back into the woodwork of the prison carpenter shop. - Impossible. - How did they escape? Thought you had us cooked, huh? We escaped through the manhole under your stove. the one you used to introduce your murderous steam pipe. It's an old mistake, Bookworm. 'Armoring the walls but leaving the floor unprotected. ' How did they discover our objective? Your talk in the Bat-mobile was picked up by a secret mic. It was relayed to us via the automatic feedback circuit in our Bat-cave. - Let's clean house, Batman. - Now, Robin. Glasses off. Alright. my fine twisty worms. Attack! Ho! You should've learned much sooner, Miss Limpet. The oldest plot, and still the best. Crime. . does not pay. A check for $5000 for the state prison library. This is very generous of you, Bruce. I thought it was the least I could do after reading about that dreadful business in the papers. Uh, The Bookworm affair? And I feel our prison libraries could use some new uplifting titles. Yes. Yeah, shocking. A man of Bookworm's education. How could such a fellow turn to a life of crime? I'd say it's an example of the old precept. "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. " A wise observation, Bruce. I'll remember that. - Uh, would you like to see him? - Bookworm? He's just outside waiting conveyance to the penitentiary. Gosh, Bruce, I'd sure like to see a real crook in the flesh. Well, I don't see any harm in it, Dick. As long as he's under sound restraint. - Get them, Chief O'Hara. - Yes, sir. Them? His female accomplice, too. A Miss Limpet. Very sad case, that one. Alright, bring 'em in. Come on, boys. Alright, you crooks, and remember be polite to Mr. Bruce Wayne, too. "The world's You abandoned child. 'Is there no hope for you?' 'As you can see, Bruce, your gift was sorely needed. ' May I keep that as a souvenir, Commissioner? - Oh, yes, certainly. - 'Thank you. ' What are you smiling at, Bookworm? Oh, I'm so much cleverer than all of you, you see. Oh, as the poet says "They who loose today may win tomorrow. " Wrong, Bookworm. Not the poet. That line's from Cervantes "Don Quixote". Part one, book one, chapter seven. Poof! That devil. This fellow, he is almost as obnoxious as Batman. Alright, alright, out, out out. Come on! Next week, The Return of The Riddler. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". When we last left the Dynamic Duo Sandman, that notorious European criminal recently arrived in Gotham City was preparing to deliver a sleeping Robin into Catwoman's clutches. While Batman was tied to a mattress above which the wicked needle of a button-stitching device was bearing down on him. For you, of course, some time has passed. For the Caped Crusaders, mere seconds. The kid's waking up, Sandman. Yeah, prepare the patient for a brief stethoscopic examination, Snooze. - Where's Batman? What have you done to him? -I? Ha-ha-ha. It was you who did it, Caped Captive. At my command, you pressed the switch which should have disposed of him by now. How ironic. Batman button-stitched to death by Robin. You fiendish quack. To the medical eye, such childish claptrap means only one thing, young man, you need some sleep. Well, we've liquidated Batman and Catwoman has her own little plan for Robin's demise. A day's dirty work well done. - Take him out to the Batmobile. -The Batmobile, Sandman? It's parked out in front. After I take him to the Catlair, I shall dispose of the Batmobile then I'm sure J. Pauline Spaghetti will be phoning frantically for another penthouse call from Dr. Somnambula. Asleep? Lovely. Lovely. - What happened to Batman? -Tell her. He's dead. Are you sure? I pushed the switch that killed him. Then you have a new assistant, Catwoman. Only as long as he remains asleep. Kitty, you know where to take him. Follow me, Robin. I'll join you shortly. I'm sure you'll find your next adventure most amazing. Did your emphasis on "amazing" have any particular significance? A play on words, Sandman. How did things go with J. Pauline Spaghetti? It shouldn't be long before her entire fortune is in my control, Catwoman. Your control? Our control. Now I must find someplace to abandon the Batmobile and then return to J. Pauline's penthouse. For such a highly respected criminal there's something insidiously untrustworthy about Sandman. Whereas he has only one life, I wonder if he realizes that a cat has nine. With Batman and Robin out of the way, all I have to do is to put J. Pauline Spaghetti to sleep again and purloin that billion-dollar fortune. Purloin seems to be more of a Catwoman word, Sandman. Never fear, in this Somnambulistic scheme l, Sandman, will have the last word, which will be the word that counts. NARRATOR". What do we have here in the depths of the newly-renovated catacombs? A maze? What's this? Still asleep, Boy Wonder? I think he's waking up a little. Creep out softly, Kitty. Where am I? On the threshold of my maze. An enlarged version of the type in which scientific experiments are carried out on rats and mice. You will notice that the entrance is here, the exit here directly adjoining. However, once you start into it it may take you the rest of your life before you get out of it, if then. Somewhere within the place, my traitorous cat servant Catarina is hopelessly wandering. Ha, ha. Unless she's found the center of the maze. In that case, she'll never return. - Ready? -No, I'm not going into that maze. I'm wide awake now and I-- This Catamizer contains deadly catasonic acid, Boy Wonder. Which do you prefer? Taking a chance on getting out of the maze in an hour, a week, a year or being catalyzed here in a matter of seconds? Hmm? Holy voltage! NARRATOR". Set ad rift without the Boy Wonder or the Batmobile Batman courageously presses on. Commissioner Gordon, I know Robin too well to believe he'd ever betray me and embrace a life of crime. I'm certain Sandman has turned him into a sleepwalker. We must make every effort to find him. I'll put every man behind it. No, commissioner, I'll find him and Sandman. But in the meantime, J. Pauline Spaghetti must have maximum protection. - The billionaire noodle queen? -I'll explain later. Meanwhile, station all men you have available in and around her penthouse suite. And above all, don't let her see a certain Dr. Somnambula. Dr. Somnambula? I must get to the Batcave as fast as possible. Let me send a police car. A needless waste of taxpayers' money, commissioner. Gotham City's transit line is the world's most rapid. Dr. Somnambula. Isn't that the name that phony Sleeping Beauty mentioned on television? Yes, Chief O'Hara. And with Robin kidnapped, the Batmobile missing J. Pauline Spaghetti somehow in dire danger and both Catwoman and Sandman deeply involved I've never said this before, Chief O'Hara, but for once, it looks as if our side has fumbled the ball. Oh! You gave me quite a start, sir. I didn't hear the Batmobile. I took the subway to Wayne Station and Batwalked up the road. You-- But what happened? Where is Master Robin? Both of them are still in the clutches of that scheming sleepy hood, Sandman who barely missed making a mattress out of me. If I may, sir. Sometimes I can't help wondering if-- If the hazards of crime-fighting are really worth the goal. That, Alfred, has never entered my mind. Perhaps the Batmobile Tracking Graph can be of some help to us now. Let's just hope that wherever the Batmobile is, Robin is. Aha. Good. The Batmobile is still transmitting its location signal. Strange. It seems to be passing through a run-down factory area. It won't be found too soon in this run-down factory area. - What about Nap? -He's right behind us in the pickup truck. It stopped. I know that section of the city well. Derwin Alley. It's surrounded by run-down factories. Perhaps a call to Commissioner Gordon, sir? No, Alfred, the Batmobile is my personal responsibility. And who knows what might have happened to Robin? But there's no subway station in that vicinity, nor a bus line. I could drive you down in the Wayne limousine, sir. I couldn't drive the Batmobile back as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. No. No, you couldn't. Let me take you in on the Alf-cycle, sir. I don't think we shall attract much attention. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yes. A wise solution. That's funny, that looks just like the Batmobile. All the new cars look alike this year. Maybe they all look alike to a rookie cop, Reggie but when you've been on the force longer, you'll see some difference. Registered to a guy named Batman, all right. With no street address. And he left the keys in the ignition. Two traffic violations right there. Vehicle code numbers-- It's not like Batman to do that. Here we are, sir. - Thank you for the lift, citizen. -The least I could do, sir. Good work, officers. I see you've found my car. Your car, bub? Got any identification? Reggie, this is Batman. I can vouch for it. Then you know your registration is incomplete and you left your keys in the ignition. The Batmobile was stolen. No doubt the thief didn't wanna get caught with the keys. Did you report it as stolen? - Not exactly. - That's another violation. - Vehicle code number-- -Reggie, will you get off it? He's got pull with Gordon and O'Hara. Correction. I try to cooperate with the police of Gotham City. I say impound the car and run him in. If you think that's your duty, officers. Let's get to work. Here's your keys, Batman. Thank you, officers. I'll correct the oversights. Did either of you see Robin when you found the Batmobile? - Who's Robin? -Oh, you've really got a lot to learn, Reggie. Robin. Robin? Batman to Robin. But deep in the labyrinth of Catwoman's maze Robin, lost and confused, doesn't know Batman is still alive. And also, finds he's joined Policewoman Mooney in the inescapable center of Catwoman's torturous trap. Robin. Boy Wonder, what are you doing in the center of this maze? It's a long story. Who are you? Catarina? Also, Policewoman Mooney. Where's Batman? I'm afraid it's over for the Caped Crusader. And for me. - And for you too. -No. - We got in here and there must be a way out. -None, Robin. None. Holy rat trap! Purr-cisely, Boy Wonder, for both of you. And then when he gets his hands on the Spaghetti billions, for Sandman. A patrol car in Derwin Alley, Batman? That must have been Officers Hogan and Dietrick. A credit to your department, commissioner. One of them pointed out three traffic violations on my part. I trust he didn't give you a ticket, Batman. The other one talked him out of it. Rather unusual police procedure but under the circumstances What are the circumstances? Have you found Robin? No, nor Sandman either. Do you know if he's tried to see J. Pauline Spaghetti again? Chief O'Hara is over there right now with all the men that we can spare. Hold on a minute, Batman. That may be him on my private phone right now. Yes? What? But how could Sandman walk into J. Pauline Spaghetti's penthouse and spirit her out from under your nose? She said he was her savior and demanded we let him in. It's hard keeping saviors out, commissioner. And then he looked at me and me men, said we seemed a little peaked and the first thing I knew, he had this stethoscope What--? Hold on a minute, chief. Commissioner Gordon. This is Tuthill, commissioner. Gotham City Security Trust. Yes, Mr. Tuthill? I'm sorry to bother you, but if you happen to hear from Batman lt just so happens he's holding on another telephone now. Why? A certain Dr. Somnambula-- Dr. Somnambula? Yes, Dr. Somnambula just told me Batman might like to know Catwoman's address, which he gave me. Uh, it's "Catacombs Condominium, Subterranean Suite 6. " What--? What did he want to see you about? He came into the bank an hour or so ago with J. Pauline Spaghetti. - What for? - It's rather sweet, really. It seems the billionaire noodle queen and her doctor are eloping. She cashed a counter check for 200 million just to see them through. Eloping? Where? They happened to mention J. Pauline Spaghetti Island. Sentimental, isn't it? The site of her first noodle factory. It's grand larceny, that's what it is. Not to mention fraud, swindle extortion, and a vicious and sinister plot. O'Hara. O'Hara. Get back over here on the double. - Still there, Batman? -Yes, commissioner. Brace yourself. How do I know this isn't some kind of trick, Batman? It's no trick, Catwoman. It's the truth. How else would I have learned the location of your Catlair? Sandman eloping with J. Pauline Spaghetti? And all those beautiful billions I suspect you wanted to get your paws on. But there is one way he might be stopped if I can count on your help. You can count on me for anything. To get even with that two-faced continental traitor. Where's Robin? Who? Robin. Sandman said that he delivered him here to you as a little souvenir of a quilting bee. Oh, Robin. Ha, ha. Ah, tsk, tsk, tsk. - Where is he, Catwoman? -Oh, you're so strong and forceful, Batman. - And determined. -Mm. If I can find Robin, we can go to J. Pauline Spaghetti island-- Your mouth is handsome when you're angry and your eyes are so flashing under that mask. Where is he, Catwoman? And if I purr, so to speak? I'll testify that you cooperated, the rest is up to the court. Ah. - Kitty, take Batman to my maze. -Maze? You'll find Robin in the center of it, if you find the center of it. Also that cunning oat servant, Catarina, otherwise known as Policewoman Mooney. - This way, Batman. -After you. Came. Pack at once. We're catching the first plane to the Canary Islands. You just missed that plane, Catwoman. How did you get in here? Wherever there's a cat, Catwoman, there's usually a back alley. NARRATOR". For the last time, what do we have here? Batman in and out of Catwoman's amazing maze in no time back in the Batmobile with Robin. And away like dynamic flashes to the Batboat and J. Pauline Spaghetti Island. You mean this is where it all began, my dear J. Pauline? Oh, doctor dear, no. It started in a little shack on the other side of the island. I used to raise my own wheat outside. Actually, this is where it all ended. Or at least my first husband ended here. Your first husband? Yes, J. Peter Spaghetti. He fell into a kneading machine. And my second husband, J. Phineas Spaghetti he dried to death on a vermicelli tray. And my third husband, J. Patrick Spaghetti cut. -Cut? You know those revolving knives that cut noodles into bite-size pieces? And J. Paul Spaghetti he stumbled into a steam cylinder. He expanded to three times his size. Not a bit pasty. Who is this for? Ah, heh. Oh, doctor dear, a wise woman must look ahead. Oh, this factory holds so many memories for me that's why I wanted to be married here. I'm so glad that you brought the witnesses along. I wonder what's happened to the minister I called. He probably stumbled into something. Shouldn't you lie down and rest before the ceremony? Oh, for my fifth wedding day? Oh, no. I don't mind staying awake for that. Sandman. Look, the living mattress. You two again? Intruding as usual. Yes, Sandman. This little sleepwalk is over. Pardon me, dear lady. Sorry to interrupt your wedding, Mrs. Spaghetti, but Holy sedative. She's asleep. I don't think sedatives had anything to do with it but she certainly is blissfully, vertically, deeply asleep. Noodles. I wanna hear what happened to both of you in the mountains. Really, I do. But I have been so involved with a landscape architect who came up with a novel idea. A maze in the front garden. - A maze? - Yes, Dick. Like they have in the gardens of old European palaces. Now, ours would be constructed on the hedge and alley system and planted with hornbeam and holly and yew. - Lovely. -Now, just think of the fun we'd have at parties. With our friends trying to find their way to the center. Indeed, madam. Very tricky. Actually, not so tricky, Alfred. You see, most mazes are based pretty much on the same pattern. Upon entering, you turn to your left. On the first two occasions where you have a choice you keep right, thereafter you keep to your left. Is that how you found--? I mean-- - Uh, is that how it's done? -Yes, that's how it's done, Dick. Of course, the garden mazes do present problems, Aunt Harriet. Do they, Bruce? For some unknown reason, they attract cats by the thousands. They're also strangely sleep-inducing undoubtedly due to the hypnotic effect of the irregular pattern. Oh. Well, then, I'll go back to my original idea. A plain clover lawn. In the long run, Aunt Harriet, I think that would be much more restful. 
NARRATOR". The start of a new semester at ivy covered Yale University and the portly professor of Egyptology outlines his plans. And then, of course, there'll be the field trip to the Gotham City Park. Oh, it bodes to be a truly exciting class, young gentlemen. That is, if you're really interested in Egyptology and not just two football players hoping this will be a snap course. Oh, we're real dedicated students, professor. Uh, sure. - How about you, professor? - Hmm? We heard you flipped a while back and assumed the identity of King Tut. Is that right? Oh, that campus newspaper. Yes, it's true. I suffer from a unique combination of amnesia and identity transference. It only happens when I suffer cranial concussion, however. Thus, as you can see I have protected myself with this hard hat. Hail almighty Tut, prince of darkness. Hail sovereign of all that's mean and evil. - Hail. - Hail. The gang's all here. NARRATOR". And late that night at the Gotham City Museum Egyptology section What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I asked you first. So you did, so you did. I am here to lay rightful claim to yon sarcophagus. - You're a thief? -You're right. And how is the guard's condition, Chief O'Hara? Still unconscious. In times like these, there's only one man who can help us solve the problem: Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne? Not Batman? There's an Egyptian costume ball at the Gotham City Hotel tonight. Bruce Wayne is chairman. Perhaps he knows something we don't. You're going to look very handsome tonight, Bruce. A magnificent Caesar. I'm glad we had this little dress rehearsal. Ha, ha. I can't wait to see Lisa dressed as Cleopatra. Phone for you, sir. In the study. It's Commissioner Gordon. Commissioner Gordon? What would he want with you, Bruce? We'll soon find out, Aunt Harriet. Excuse me. I can't imagine Alfred making an error like that. What did you say, Dick? Uh, nothing, Aunt Harriet. Alfred, I'm shocked at your breach of secrecy. No need to be, sir. The commissioner's call was for Bruce Wayne, not Batman. But a feeling inside me suggested that you should take it in here. - Hello, commissioner. -As chairman of tonight's Egyptian ball can you tell me what significance the robbery of a sarcophagus circa 1300 B. C. might have? Its principal value would be that of an antique. Wait a moment, commissioner. in which King Tut trod the land. That's what I was afraid of. I'd hoped it was some sort of a publicity stunt. My committee would never engage in such a stunt. Then it appears our old nemesis King Tut may have returned to haunt us. My suggestion would be to call Batman immediately. Sound thinking, Bruce. Bruce Wayne advised me to call Batman. Heh. Well, I guess millionaires aren't so dumb after all. Otherwise they never would have become millionaires. Hmm. Yes, commissioner. The worst has come to pass, Batman. I know. King Tut is back in Gotham City. We'll be right there. Absolutely incredible. You'd think the man could read my mind. To the Batpoles. Why doesn't he stay where he belongs? Up at Yale, where he's a nice, mild-mannered professor? Don't forget, Robin, when the professor metamorphosizes-- Changes into King Tut he forgets his true identity. - No clues? -Nary a one. Tut once tried to claim Gotham City as his kingdom. You don't suppose he'd try it again? I doubt it. He was thwarted in that gambit. Hello? No. Oh. How brutal. Well, we'll get on it right away. In the meantime, leave everything exactly as you found it. Fouad Sphinx, the talented Middle Eastern pantomimist has just been found in his swank suite at the Oasis Hotel. - Alive? - Barely, Batman. He's been pummeled about the head and shoulders by someone answering the description of Tut. Furthermore, he was tied up in the classic tradition. Oh. Sphinx, Oasis, Middle Eastern. You think it could mean something? Chances are it could be a clue. Let's go. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in Tut's hideout at the Pyramid Club a shattered roadhouse in an underdeveloped suburb Hi, Tut baby. What's shaking? Batman's head, unless I miss my guess. Heh, heh. - Can we get up now? - My back hurts. You may rise. - Oh! Be it ever so humble. -What's with him? Please, Neila, you may be goddess of the Nile but I am your king. And soon I will claim my queen. Mm. The lovely Lisa Carson daughter of wealthy socialite John E. Carson will appear at the Egyptian Ball tonight as Cleopatra. Her escort will be millionaire Bruce Wayne as Julius Caesar. Come, observe. Heh. Millionaire Bruce Wayne. Blech! Tonight he'll lose his queen to me the king! Oh, pulchritudinous! Just as I have envisioned her down through the centuries. And tonight she will be mine alone. And where does that leave me? You could always be a lady in waiting. - But I thought she was-- -Silence, Tutlings! I have been reincarnated, as the whole world knows and now so has the lovely Cleopatra. Meanwhile, the Caped Crusaders Bat-climb their way to Fouad Sphinx's hotel suite. Suzy Knickerbocker, what are you doing in Gotham City? I go where the action is, Batman. The Caribbean, the Riviera, the Greek Islands. Wherever there's glamor, that's where I am. I'm afraid you'll find it pretty quiet here, then. Oh, I don't know, Boy Wonder. I hear millionaire Bruce Wayne is really one of the hippies. All that marvelous money and fantastic Wayne Manor. Stately Wayne Manor. Mr. Wayne is basically a very serious young man. Sometimes those serious ones fool you. Batman, I think that's a darling little costume you're wearing. Where did you get it, in London or Rome? No, I believe in patronizing local craftsmen. There's a guy who makes great capes and cowls right here in Gotham City. Ha, ha. I think you two belong in my column. I'll slip you in somewhere between Acapulco and Princess Grace. Holy jet set! Imagine us in Suzy Knickerbocker's column, Batman. An unlikely spot for two mundane crime fighters. - And speaking of crime fighting -I adored seeing both of you. I wonder who they really are. Probably a couple of international playboys. I mean, who else would climb walls? Ah, the Caped Crusaders. We left everything just as we found it per Commissioner Gordon's instruction. Good work, officer. Ah, that must be the talented pantomimist in question. How do you feel, Mr. Sphinx? How do I look, Batman? King Tut is a very muscular fellow. What did King Tut say? He said, "You got my message?" Was there anything else? Yes. He left you a note. It's in my pocket here. It's written in an ancient tongue, Robin circa 1300 B. C. - King Tut's era. -Yes, this will require further study. - To the Batcave. -Batman. Yes, Mr. Sphinx? Think it would be all right if someone untied me? I'm getting a little cramped. Of course. Officer, untie this poor fellow. "L, the great King Tut have returned to Gotham City to wreak revenge on Batman and his accursed companion. " Hey, that's me. "And next in importance, to claim my own. " His own what? That is the question. Commissioner, we've just deciphered the scroll. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Uh-huh. I knew that he'd be after you and Robin, but to claim his own - What does it mean? -Whatever his plan, commissioner with the Ancient Egyptian Ball being tonight I have a feeling our evil friend may put in an appearance there. I'll have a cordon of police in attendance and to keep them from being noticed, they'll be attired as Egyptians. I want seven of your best men at the ball tonight in Egyptian raiment. Gotham City's finest dressed up like a bunch of heathens? May the saints preserve us. Don't you ninnies understand that I want Batman and Robin to show up at the ball tonight? What happens when you show up at the ball? You underestimate your sovereign's think tank. I have this day delivered to a certain address in Gotham City a replica of the royal robes and mask of the great King Tut. Mayor Linseed is away on one of his frequent visits to the Asian front but Deputy Mayor Zorty is acting in his stead. Tonight he will be I! Heh. What are you doing? Get your hands off me. This is an outrage. Tell that to the commissioner. What in the world do you think you're doing? For you, my queen. Good work, men. You got him. The city's no longer in peril. The city may not be in peril, O'Hara but you and your clumsy clods are. Uh-oh. If it's who I think it is, and I think it is I'll be back pounding the beat, and so will you, commissioner. Unhand him, gentlemen. It's himself. Deputy Mayor Zorty- We all owe you an apology, sir. We had a report that the evil King Tut was back in town. I'm not blaming you, Gordon. You were doing your duty. But what about the real King Tut? No doubt this subterfuge was part of his plot. He may be at the ball at this moment. Go back there, men. On the double. This time get the right king or you, O'Hara, and all the rest of you will be back pounding a beat again. Mm. Would you look at her? Every inch a queen. Mm. You're right, it's Tut. We'll play this cautiously, Dick. Watch and wait. Do you boys know that man? If he's who we think he is, we do. And if we do, we'll deal with him. - Mr. Wayne? -Yes. We're from the police. We've been ordered to apprehend the man disguised as King Tut. - Oh, yes, I know. -ls something wrong? Don't worry, Aunt Harriet. Well spoken, noble mark. - We've got a plan, if you'll help us. -Of course. See those men over there? They're also police. The king seems to be attracted to the queen, Cleopatra. You can say that again. If you can get the young lady to dance with the king steer him over to that exit we could capture him quietly without disturbing the others. I'll try to oblige. By your leave, Your Highness. It's an honor to dance with you, Your Majesty. I know it is. Not every young girl gets a chance to wrap her arms around the king. Oh! My, what a short dance. Yes, it isn't like Lisa to go off with a stranger. Mr. Wayne, have you seen King Tut? Yes, the police just took him away. Or did they? - We're the police. -Notify the commissioner. Dick, come on. Mercy gracious sakes alive. I placed a tracking device in Lisa's clothes, Robin. See here? Watch closely. It stopped. We've zeroed in on them, Robin. Commissioner, you've heard the news, of course. We've located the royal palace. Undoubtedly, King Tut has taken Miss Carson there. The Pyramid Club. A shuttered roadhouse in an underdeveloped suburb. I'm sorry. Robin and I had better attempt this one ourselves. A girl's life is in danger. This mission has to be accomplished quietly. NARRATOR". But in his hideout in the shuttered Pyramid Club King Tut plans some noise of his own. But I'm not Cleopatra. I'm Lisa Carson. I live right here in Gotham City on the fashionable lower east part of the Upper West Side. Your home is on the Nile. I've never been to the Nile, and I'm never going. Fate and I will take you there. Look, if this is some kind of a joke, I've had enough. Who are you, anyway'? Who am I? Heh, heh. Tut! Master of Thebes, King of the Nile moon god of Thoth. And that's just on Mama's side of the family. I have a wealthy father, and he'll pay anything to let me go. There's not enough money in all the world to rob me of the rapture of having my queen by my side forever. You're not going to have me by your side ever. I wonder how a little stay in the royal dungeon would affect you. Strange how that clammy enclosure can have a warming effect on people. Jester! Lord Chancellor! Bolted tight. - Should we try the Batmelter on the lock'? -No, we must find other means. You stay here and watch the door. I'll see what I can find above. Mission accomplished, Your Highness. She's locked up, all right. Though it sure seems like a waste of money. Though it's none of my business, I guess. Hmm? You're right, royal jester, it's none of your business and that's no guess. If that girl in the dungeon ain't kidding, there could be a fortune in this. Well, what do you know, the first robin of spring. Let's take him to the head birdwatcher the king himself. Oh. A bird of prey. Tie him up! Stop! Wait a minute. If the Caped Crumb is here the Cowled Creep can't be far behind. That's right, Tut. Now what shall we do with our mortal enemies who shan't be mortal much longer? Hmm Hmm Ah. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. For the moment, we'll leave Boy Wonder tied up to decide his ultimate fate. But as for Batman open the royal sarcophagus. Put him in it. Friends, Egyptians, henchmen lend me your ears. I come to bury Batman, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them. The good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Batman. It isn't that I love you any less, Batman. Simply that I love me more. Hmm? Bubble, bubble, little bat at the bottom of the vat. Your wings will dry and soon you'll fly to the great big belfry in the sky. 
NARRATOR". When last we saw the Caped Crusaders they were trapped in Black Widow's giant cobweb about to be bitten by two deadly Black Widow spiders. Are the heroes headed for that great Batcave in the sky? In scant seconds, the answer will be yours. Batman, he's almost on me. He is a she, Robin. Only the female of the species is venomous. And mine is almost upon me also. I've freed my right hand. Now if I can just reach the mini charge in my utility belt. I've got it. Brace yourself for a shock of 5000 volts, Robin. We'll be stunned for a split second. But the cobweb will act as a conductor, and the spiders will be electrocuted. - Hurry, Batman. She's ready to bite me. -Now. Good going, Batman. I thought we were dead ducks. I'm sure Black Widow thinks we're dead bats about now. What was that exit line of hers? Something about "My lieutenants and I are going to tunnel into my vault. " Tunnel, that's how most crooks get into vaults. But into her own vault? And she couldn't have gotten far. She's left the Black Widow Cycle here. This must be it. And two for me. Two for you. And two for me. Two for you. I wouldn't grow too attached to all of that if I were you, Black Widow. For heaven's sake, look who's here. You didn't count on us, did you, you sophisticated but evil woman? As a matter of fact, no. But how fiendishly clever of you. And how handsome you are, Bat-doll. Watch out for a trick, Batman. Don't worry, Robin. She won't catch us off guard this time. You needn't try to short circuit our brains, Black Widow. We're still wearing our anti-short circuit Bat-brain electrodes. Batman, I've lost one of my electrodes. Bad luck, old chum, but perhaps I can pull off a bluff. No amount of UHF short circuiting can affect the brain of either Robin or me. Are you definitely wearing your electrodes, darlings? - Definitely. -Definitely. Marvelous, because I've reversed the polarity on my brainwave short circuiter. Just an added little precaution. And with the electrodes on, you've had it. You, she-devil. Have you short circuited Batman's brain? No cause for alarm, Robin. I feel fine, just fine. You see, Robin baby. Now be a good little Boy Wonder and do just as I say. No, I will not submit to your treachery! Trap Door, sweetie pie, you're needed. Wrap up Robin, my boys. Ah! Very good, kiddies. You're learning the business. Ha-ha-ha. Now, is there anything I can do for you, Black Widow? As a matter of fact, there is. I have a perfectly devastating idea. Masked Muscles, you go back through the tunnel into my main web and have a little drink to the latest development. Ha, ha. - How does that grab you, doll? -Fine. - Could we take Robin along too? -But of course. No Robin, no Dynamic Duo. - N'est-ce pas? - Ha, ha. Now, I imagine Robin is getting a bit heavy? Boys, I'm sure the Bat-doll would like to get rid of him. Better tie him up. Well, Bat-doll, perhaps you would like some champagne? I never touch spirits. Have you some milk? Milk? Oh, yes, yes. Oh, maybe Trap Door has some. Trap Door, have you got any milk in there? Thank you. - Perhaps you'd like to mix your own. -Thank you. Delicious milk. Well, now, my dear, this may come as a surprise to you but I have a little problem. You, Black Widow? I thought business was good. Business is boring. I've completely run out of banks to rob. I've run through them all. Now, that's where you may come in handy. Me? How? Well, everyone's heard about your Batcave and everyone's heard about your Batcomputer in your Batcave. Oh. You want me to get the Batcomputer to give you a bank to rob. Precisely. Do you think that you could send for it? We don't have to send for it. I have right here in my Utility Belt a remote control Batcomputer oscillator. Oh, heh. - How convenient. How does it work? -Simple. I just press this button and it activates the radio frequency Bat-generator. - And I just talk to it? -No, I talk into it. It wouldn't recognize your voice. Now, question: ls there any bank in Gotham City which Black Widow has not robbed? My word, wherever he is Batman must be operating his remote control Batcomputer oscillator. Ah. Here we are. The just-opened Heritage First National Bank. How perfectly lovely. Ha-ha-ha! Again? It must be adding something. Wait a minute, it's sending a further message. - What is, darling? -Here. "Seen with Black Widow. Batman's life in great danger?" Oh, it really seems as if your criminal career is over even before it starts. But I am certainly not going to risk your life. Let's take the gamble. Batcomputer's known to be wrong when it's elected to go off on its own, right? Ah, ha, ha. No, but I have a brilliant idea. Tarantula, go upstairs, get Grandpa off his rocker and bring him down here quickly. Batman, you wouldn't by any chance happen to have an extra Batsuit just kind of lying around, would you? Oh, yes, as a matter of fact, we do. Lovely. Lovely. Now, Tarantula, I want you to bring my makeup kit and I want you to make Grandpa to look exactly like Batman and I will make myself up to look exactly like Robin. Now, look here, darling, I want you to call the manager of the just-opened Heritage First National Bank. You may use my Web Phone. Try it. NARRATOR". While Black Widow hatches her plot, at Commissioner Gordon's office I don't know what he's doing behind that mask of his but at least there haven't been any bank robberies in quite a while. - That's a good sign, isn't it, Chief O'Hara? -A very good sign. Caped Crusader probably has Black Widow under lock and key at this very minute. - Commissioner Gordon. -This is Irving Irving at the just-opened Heritage First National Bank. - Yes, Mr. Irving. -I just had a call from Batman. He wants me to take $40,000 in a brown paper bag to the front of the bank at exactly 11:43 this morning. -Well, that sounds odd, Mr. Irving. He says the Batmobile will be parked there. And he's arranged for Black Widow to meet him and they will split the money. Oh, well, then do it by all means. - Thank you for calling, Mr. Irving. - All right, commissioner. Ha! Apparently, Batman is springing a trap on Black Widow. That's good. Are you sure you're gonna be able to drive the Batmobile from the passenger side? Perfectly, Tarantula. What time is it, doll? Exactly 11 :37. Got to run, sweetheart. Keep an eye on the Dynamic Duo. While my Batman and Robin do their stuff. Ta-da, darling. Well, Chief O'Hara, Black Widow's caper should be just about over. And I should be hearing from Batman now. Yes, right on schedule. Why isn't he calling on the Batphone? Commissioner Gordon. Ah, ha-ha-ha. Ro-- Robin did what, Mr. Irving? Oh. Thank you for calling, sir. Yes, we'll get out a bulletin right away. Glory be, commissioner. What's wrong? The just-opened Heritage First National Bank has just been robbed. - By Batman and Robin. -Saints preserve us. Yes, indeed, saints preserve us if the Caped Crusaders have gone crooked. Which apparently they have. Mr. Irving could hardly have dreamed that this happened. Chief O'Hara, I want an APB to all units for the arrest of Batman. Hopefully alive, but we'll take him the other way if we have to. Attention all units. Be on alert for Batman. First name unknown. Caucasian. Height: 6'2, wearing purple trunks, purple cape, purple cowl and a black bat insignia on his chest. He has a masked accomplice whose alias is Robin. Approach with caution. They may be armed. I hate to do it, Caped Crusader, but I have to take you in. You're on the wanted list. My gun's pointed at you, Caped Crusader. Don't make me use it. Think Batman is afraid of you, Copper? Go on and shoot. I dare you. What's happened to you, Boy Wonder? Even your voice has turned snarly. None of your business, Flatfoot. Now, go ahead and shoot, because you'll never take us alive. Batman, I'm giving you three to get out of the car with your hands up. One. Two. Three. I couldn't have missed at such close range. I've killed Batman! Red six on a black seven! I certainly don't wish to be rude but normally the game of solitaire requires only one player. Ha, ha. Oh, come on, Batman, cheat a little. Or it ain't no fun! Why don't you two kibitzers go outside and wait for Black Widow? - All that loot. Sure. -Yes. Trap Door! Come on. Batman. - Who untied you? -I untied myself. - Was that wise? -Yes. And I want you to do me a favor. - What? -Sing a song for me. - Loud. -Oh. All right. Ahem. - How about some Gilbert and Sullivan? -Fine. Ha, ha. I'm called little Buttercup Dear little Buttercup Though I could never tell why A little louder. But still I'm called Buttercup Pool little Buttercup Sweet little Buttercup, I Robin? What's happening? Batman, I want you to come with me later today and rob a bank. Robin, don't even joke about such a thing. Have you lost all your sense of judgment? Holy reverse polarity, I did it! I got you out of Black Widow's clutches! Of course, I knew what I was doing but with my cerebrum short circuited I couldn't stop myself. You sit down here, Robin. I'll retie your hands and pretend that my brain is still short circuited. Sure and it's a dark hour in Gotham City, commissioner. Yes. But I was faced with the decision and I had to make it. How will we be breaking the news to the people? We'll tell them the truth. Batman was shot and killed when he and Robin Robin? No doubt he's gone into hiding. Most likely in the Batcave. Maybe I can talk to him. Get him to surrender. So no more of the Dynamic Duo's blood will be spilled on the streets of our fair city. I'm sorry, sir. Batman is not here. I know that. - We've lost the Caped Crusader. -Lost? One of our officers was forced to shoot Batman. And the Boy Wonder has become one of Gotham City's ten most wanted men. Boys. Is he there hiding out? No, I'm afraid not, sir. But-- But isn't it possible that a mistake has been made? No mistake was made. Why? Well, it's a long and rather involved story, sir. You see, earlier today, Batman activated the Batcomputer via his remote control Batcomputer oscillator. Remote control? I took the liberty of getting some information from the, uh, Batcomputer myself. Batman activated the computer from, uh, "411 Larva Drive. " -411 Larva Drive. -Larva Drive. Sounds like a good place for Black Widow's hideout. Thank you. We'll get on it right away. Get some men and some squad cars, and let's go. I'm back, boys. Well, now, after a brief encounter with the law and a quick change in the lady's lounge-- Oh, Grandpa's back too on the porch. Guess what I have in this tiny little bag. - More stolen money? -What else? Oh, Batman, you were out of this world. And, of course, I was adorable as baby Boy Wonder. Robin's pretty good as a Boy Wonder too. You bet I am, Batman. Let's get them. Now, what did I do with that silly short circuiting device? You mean, what did I do with it, you obsessed woman. Black Widow. First of all, Robin and I will wanna return all the stolen moneys to banks A through H. What a perfect idea. - And secondly-- Batman. Oh, it's really you. In cape and cowl, commissioner. Why? - I'll explain later, but thank heaven. - And this is Black Widow. So you're the she-devil who's been robbing us out of house and home. Oh, you must be Chief O'Hara. What a delightful surprise. Why don't you ask her if she'd like to go along to jail with you, Chief O'Hara? Oh, don't ask. My heart says no but my brain says yes, love. I feel it's my responsibility to tell you that you have the constitutional right to consult with your attorney before answering any questions. -Ah! But I want to answer his questions. Sweetheart, I cannot tell you how much you remind me of my dear departed Max. - You'd better come with me, Black Widow. -Thank you. Goldberg, you take care of the rest of them. I can't wait to see how it turns out, angel. If it really looks good, I'd love to have you come over every day and give me a wash and set. Why don't we have a look? Ah! Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And only Batman knows for sure. Batman there's a question I got to be asking you and the Boy Wonder. Yes, chief? With all the crime that you and Robin should be out fighting how do you find time to come here and fix Black Widow's coiffeur? Those aren't hair dryers, Chief O'Hara. They're Bat Wave Brain Analyzers, which Robin and I have slightly rewired. Oh, you mean you're not really fixing their hair? Right. What we're doing is decriminalizing them. It may take months of treatment, but we feel it's worth a try. If we can permanently short circuit the bad streaks in them we will make honest useful citizens out of those spidery crooks. Chief O'Hara, do you realize what time it is'? I'm famished. Please bring me a menu, doll. And don't forget the wine list. You heard the lady, chief. Get a menu. Yes. Yes, ma'am. A menu and a wine list. I'll see if I can locate them. Divine, darling. Absolutely divine. 
NARRATOR". Gotham State Penitentiary, an impregnable fortress under maximum security where rehabilitation, not punishment, is the keynote. Hello, Catwoman. Mm, hello. You're familiar with millionaire Bruce Wayne? Yes, we've met. Is there any particular reason you had me brought here? I was taking my afternoon catnap. We're, uh, taking a gamble on you, Catwoman. Your parole application has been granted due to the insistence of one of the members of the board. - You're letting me go? -With this proviso a board member will act as your parole officer. He, heaven help him, will be totally responsible for your actions. Who's that? Millionaire Bruce Wayne. Warden I owe my life of crime to the fact that I was a drop-out. I'm going back to Gotham City University to immerse myself in education. NARRATOR". Late the next night, a curious happening takes shape in one of Gotham City University's hallowed halls. A student prank? Or a feline scheme of that university's most recently registered student? Meanwhile, in Stately Wayne Manor Yes, commissioner. I'm not certain if this requires your attention, Batman but some strange goings-on have been going on. Who is it this time, commissioner? Joker, Egghead, Riddler, King Tut? I don't know. A statue has been stolen at Gotham City University. Sounds like a freshman prank to me. Perhaps and then again, perhaps not. The statue was a full-sized replica of you, Batman. My graven image, eh? We'll be right there, commissioner. To the Batpoles. Utterly baffling. With all due respect to Batman's myriad fans, why would anyone steal a mere statue? Maybe it was some kind of dumb fraternity stunt. Unfortunately, I can think of a more sinister reason. What, Batman? As you may recall that statue was made from a perfect mold of my body. And the costume is an exact plaster duplicate of yours. Precisely, Robin. This theft may be the first step in some diabolical imposture of myself. Gosh, if we only had some clue. There is one, Boy Wonder. We found this freshman beanie, size 6 and seven-eighths, at the scene of the outrage. Can you trace it? There are approximately 5700 male freshmen enrolled for this semester at GCU 3127 of them wear a size 6 and seven-eighths beanie. It's a start. May I see the beanie in question, Chief O'Hara? - Robin? -Yes, Batman? Do you see what I see? Depends. What do you see? A single strand of red hair. - A clue? -Could be a vital clue, Commissioner Gordon. I've just perfected an electronic hair Bat-analyzer which may hold the key to this baffling question. Let's go, Robin. NARRATOR". And in the basement of the Eta Beta Lotka sorority house adjoining the GCU campus I gotta hand it to you, Catwoman. Hiding us out in a sorority house was a stroke of genius. Yeah. Who'd ever think of looking for men in an all-girls house? -Ha, ha. There's no time for self-aggrandizement. There's work to be done. - To be done. Cornell, have at it. -Right, Catwoman. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen, for all your applause but I don't really deserve it. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for all your applause but I don't really deserve it. If I hadn't heard Batman with my own ears, I wouldn't have believed it. That's quite good, Cornell. Just clear your throat and you'll be perfect. Ha. Ah. Yes, that ought to do. Mm. I'll try it on for size. It's time for class. Oh, listen, fellas. Make sure you return that statue. I want them to think it was a simple-minded prank. Ha-ha-ha. Come on, Penn. Batman is guest lecturer today and we wouldn't wanna miss any of his pearls of wisdom. Penn where's your beanie? I I must have lost it somewhere. Brown, lend him yours. You cut class. Catwoman. You're under arrest. You almost gave me cataplexy. Ha! I've created a monster. Ha, ha. Oh, well. If I can't tell the difference, who can'? I still think it's pretty fishy, Batman. Catwoman taking Elementary Criminology. I agree, Robin. Better keep our eyes peeled. Good day, students. I'll begin by remarking that criminology, like other sciences has made remarkable strides over recent years. Batman's right, students. We catch more crooks in our Batcave anti-crime lab than in the field. For example, last night a certain statue was purloined right here at Gotham City U. This beanie was found at the scene of the crime. There was one strand of red hair caught in the fabric. I have microscopically analyzed it and here are my findings. From this single strand of hair I've been able to determine that the man is 6 feet, one-and-three-quarters inches in height is 36 years old, has flat feet, wears glasses speaks in a deep voice and suffers from hay fever. Help. What do I do? Cheese it. I'll set off the bell with my remote-control Cat-radio. Pardon me. Batman. Okay. Okay. Now, if all you students will just clear away Batman and I would like to be alone. What makes you think so, Catwoman? Ooh. I just thought it would be so amusing. It would be the first time you weren't trying to arrest me and I wasn't trying to murder you. Very well. Just a second while I retrieve my beanie, my hair, my tweezers, and my notes. It gets fishier all the time, Batman. Did you happen to notice how the bell rang two minutes after the class began? Of course. She's up to something, Robin. I'm merely playing along with it. I'll bet every female criminal in America would swap her time off for good behavior just to change places with me. - I'm flattered. -Mm. As soon as I graduate I'll be coming to you for a job. What I want most in life is to work side-by-side with you, Batman. That job is filled. Oh, Robin. Well maybe by that time he'll be all grown up and on his own. I can't tell you how happy I am about your change of heart. You seem to have lost all the egotism that once marred your great beauty. Batman? - Batman, we've been framed. -What? I just heard over the radio, someone who looks exactly like you has been positively identified as having robbed a supermarket. Well, at least that explains the curious theft of that statue. Don't move, you costumed-kook. We've got you covered. You're under arrest for knocking off a supermarket. Who the heck are you? Name's Courageous. Captain Courageous. Just arrived here from Los Angeles under the police-exchange program. Holy Hollywood, an out-of-towner. That's why he doesn't know who Batman is. You say I've been identified as a criminal? Twenty witnesses. What's your alibi? I've been here all morning sipping a soda with Catwoman. - He was. I'll swear to that. -Ha! Who's gonna take the word of a 50-time loser? Slap the handcuffs on him, boys. Here's a dime. Call Commissioner Gordon. Sorry, sonny. Only one phone call allowed. - To his lawyer, if the kook has one. -That's right. Go ahead and make the call. Your lawyer? The number's in the phone book under the firm name of Alfred and Alfred. All right, let's get going. Yes, Chief O'Hara. I just heard there's to be a spontaneous demonstration in Chimes Square tonight. Well, now, who's demonstrating and what for? The students at Gotham City University intend to loiter. And what's more, Catwoman is the loiter leader. Catwoman? Assign every man you have to the Gotham Whiteway at dusk. Yes, sir. - Batman? -Yes. My card. Serge Tort, attorney-at-law. Specialist in felonies, misdemeanors, and over-time parking tickets. Uh, sit down, Mr. Tort. It appears that someone has been masquerading as me, Mr. Tort. But I'm innocent, you have my word. Oh, I'm sure you are, Mr. Batman. But there is nothing more damaging than eyewitness testimony. Good luck, sir. Think the disguise will work? Let's hope so, Alfred. Guard. Let me out, please. Ah, Captain Courageous. How was the first day on the job? Not bad. Not bad, Commissioner Gordon. I captured a desperate criminal today. Wonderful. Who was it? Some joker calls himself Batman. Batman? You ninny. Release him and release him fast. But-- But-- But-- You do very clever impressions of a motorboat, captain. - Get moving. -Yes, sir. - Hello? -This is Commissioner Gordon. - I'd like to speak to Mr. Wayne, please. -Yes, just a moment. Bruce. It's Commissioner Gordon. Thank you, Aunt Harriet. - Hello, commissioner. -I just thought you'd be sorry to learn that Catwoman intends to lead a sit-in tonight in the heart of Chimes Square, Mr. Wayne. I'm certain there's some illegal reason behind it. You're her parole officer, aren't you? I guess I haven't done a very good job, commissioner. Still, I must award you an E for effort. Goodbye. Commissioner, the Batman's escaped. Tied up a lawyer and walked out in disguise. Ha-ha-ha. Good old Batman. No jail can hold him, not even ours. He's probably at the Batcave already. You'll learn soon enough not to doubt the masked manhunter. Yes, commissioner. You're calling to tell me about Catwoman's latest peregrinations. Incredible. I just heard about it myself. How do you do it? It's my job, commissioner. I must stay at least two steps ahead of each criminal. We'll be at Chimes Square tonight. Holy crystal ball. How'd you know the Batphone was gonna ring? Elementary. I'll explain on the way down. To the Batpoles. We have yet to determine Catwoman's ultimate scheme. Let's program the Bat-calendar and see what's transpiring in Gotham City this fine day. I'm sure we'll find the answer to her plot here. There's a prize cat show at Gotham City Square Garden. The opening of the Feline Fur Salon on the Avenue of the Armenians. A rock 'n' roll concert by The Lions & the Tigers at Spayed Stadium. And the Batagonian cat's-eye opal sale at the offices of the Forever Jewel Company. I'm afraid we have our work cut out for us, Robin. To the Batmobile. Every year on this date the Batagonian cat's-eye opal people arrive in Gotham City to sell their jewels. Cat's-eye opals? They're bad luck. Pish-tosh. That's a superstition not grounded in fact. Anyway, they're worth millions. - We gonna steal them? - Naturally. I've discovered where the showroom sale is. It'll be cat's play. Yeah, but what about Batman and the police? As per my plan, Batman is languishing in some jail. Ha, ha! And the befuddled police will have their gloves full just clearing those misguided students off the streets. You've come up with a beaut, Catwoman. Yes. Yes, I really have. Cornell, go and get the Cat-illac and bring it round. We're gonna transform Chimes Square into Crime Square. NARRATOR". And that night, in Chimes Square on the Gotham City Whiteway There's only one way for us to get our rights. We must let the world know about them. Students everywhere will thank us for what we are about to do tonight. Are you ready? Yes! Go to it! Go back, students. Go back. Aww. Go back to your homes and hearths. Can't you see she's trying to lead you down a thorny path? Batman? I thought he was in jail. I'm afraid that aside from his many other attributes Batman is probably the world's greatest escape artist. No matter. I have something infinitely more fiendish in mind for him. To the elevators. NARRATOR". Moments later, atop the Gotham City Chimes Building Catwoman deploys her forces in the blinking light of the Crespie's Coffee mechanical billboard. Well, citizen, to what do we owe the pleasure of this visit? I was hoping to revive my TV show, People Are Funny but I can't seem to find any unusual people in Gotham City. No, this is just an ordinary, fine, upstanding metropolis. Not many weirdos. - Any particular types in mind? -Oh, someone perhaps with a strange costume. Mm. No, most of those characters like Joker, Penguin, King Tut are safely locked up. Maybe somebody with a dual identity or a unique approach to a problem. I'm climbing the walls looking for them. I wish we could help you. But we're just a couple of ordinary crime fighters going about our mundane business. I see. Well, thank you for your interest. Maybe I'll give up the whole idea. Too bad. It's a great show. Costume? Dual identity? Climbing the walls? Hey, Batman. They should have been here by now. - Here we are. - In the flesh. Oh, Catwoman. Catwoman, will you never learn? Men! Two obstacles stand between me and you and a life of splendor and plenty. Eradicate them. Batman. Batman. Get them. You had your chance, Catwoman, but you blew it. You're a blot on the name of Gotham City University. When the students find out what kind of a person you really are they'll hate you for forever. Nobody loves me. There, there, Catwoman. It'll be all right. Can I use my cat-kerchief? I'm ruining my eyeshadow. Of course. Fools. Don't they know that tears are a woman's most effective weapon? Batman. Batman, wake up. What are you doing? I've flavored the coffee in this peculator with a dash of sulfuric acid. Once a minute, the peculator pours its contents into the cup. So if you get that searing feeling in your stomachs, it won't be heartburn. It'll be all burn. Holy caffeine. And best of all, everybody will see you go up in smoke. Look. You have a perverted sense of the dramatic, Catwoman. You're absolutely right. Brown, throw the switch. You have one minute. Bye-bye. 
Thank you, dear peoples. Thank you, everyone. 'Now in conclusion. ' On behalf of my country Moldavia, land of charm is such pleasure to unveil for you Moldavia's greatest national treasure behind me on platform. But there is a small ceremony. It's traditional Moldavian friendship cake, dear peoples. Which I'll now chop for you in the name of. . Hey look! Look what shot from that cake. "Why is an orange like a bell?" You know what this means, don't you? The Riddler. Right, Chief O'Hara, The Riddler. That infernal prince of puzzlers who's outwitted us a dozen times. What about it, men? O'Hara? Inspector Basch? Any of you think you can handle him? I don't know who is behind that mask but I do know when we need him. And we need him now. I'll call him, sir. We're in lucky, he's at home. My resources are behind you in full. You're a real champion, Mr. Wayne. - 'Indeed you are. ' - Don't mention it, Mr. Harris. 'Perhaps, if there had been anti-crime centers' of the type you now propose when my own parents were murdered by dastardly criminals. . Yes, Alfred. The Bat-phone, sir. Forgive me, I'm just reminded I'd promised to take my young ward, Dick Grayson fishing. If you'll excuse me. It'll be a pleasure working with you, sir. It's wonderful knowing you're behind this. Oh, there you are, Dick. Feel like a bit of fishing? Holy barracuda! You mean. . Sure, Bruce. Why not? Sounds swell. Doesn't it, Aunt Harriet? Yes, commissioner. You'll never guess who's on the loose. Your old arch enemy, The Riddler. - Good heavens! - Him again? Can you come to headquarters right away? It'll be a pleasure, Commissioner Gordon. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Clear. Ready to move out. "Why is an orange like a bell?" Answer! Because they both must be peeled! Right. You peel an orange and you peal a bell. Get it? What idiots we are! Why couldn't we have worked that out? But what does it mean, though? Right, commissioner. There's a problem. We all know how this quizzical criminal operates. He deliberately leaves clues to confound us. Clues which may or may not lead to the real crime he's planning. - The real crime? - Precisely, Inspector Basch. The Riddler contrives his plots like artichokes. You have to strip off spiny leaves to reach the heart. But surely, Batman, there must be some sort of political plot against Moldavia. - That exploding cake-- - A mere ruse, commissioner. A clever device to make you call me in. But why? Why would he want that? You're his deadly nemesis. The Riddler's mind is twisted. Crime's no fun for him unless it means outwitting us. Robin's right. He has this strange, artistic compulsion to. . Artistic. That's it. The meaning of the first clue. The Peale Art Gallery. Of course! It's a store house of priceless art treasures. - Just The Riddler's meat. - Call out your boys, chief. Stakeout that Peale Art Gallery like you would a circus tent. Yes, sir. 'Not so fast, men. Wait. ' The Riddler's up to something tricky. Better let us handle this. It smells like a trap. Let's mosey up the back way. Batman speaking. 'This is a recording. ' 'Before you trip over your cape, Batman, riddle me this. ' 'There are three men in a boat with four cigarettes' 'but no matches. ' 'How do they manage to smoke, hm?' The Riddler. What the heck's he trying to tell us? I don't know. Let's go up and ask him. Stand clear. - You go first. I'll anchor you. - Roger. Gosh, if I could just figure out that riddle. Why can't I get it? Maybe your mind's on that cute little teenager who waved to you on the way across town. Aw, come on, Batman. Caught him red-handed. Watch it, chump. Pedestrian safety. Oh, sure. Sorry. Hold it, Riddler. The game's up, Riddler. As a duly deputized agent of the law 'I place you under arrest for armed robbery. ' - Snap on the Bat-cuffs. - You've got me, Batman. What the. . It's too delicious. I even gave you a tip-off. Batman, you've made a mistake. He didn't steal that cross. What? I tell you, it belongs to him. He lent it to me for a show. But, Mr. Peale, we saw him take it from you at gunpoint. Gunpoint? Holy Ashtray! He did tip us off. "There were three men in a boat "with four cigarettes and no matches. How did they manage to smoke?" They threw one cigarette overboard and made the boat a cigarette lighter. You saw him giving me a light as I handed back his cross. Out riddled! I thought you might be, Batman. That's why I brought witnesses with cameras. Ho-ho! What is it that no man wants to have yet no man wants to lose? A lawsuit. Correct, Boy Wonder! How I've waited for this? It makes my whole life worthwhile. After you've chewed over this for a while look for two more. Adios, amigos. See you in court. 'According to legal experts' 'the one million dollar lawsuit' 'filed this morning against Batman' for assault, slander and false arrest appears to have every chance of success. 'Causing even greater dismay in law enforcement circles' 'is the fact that Batman will undoubtedly' have to reveal his true identity in court. - 'Once unmasked it is feared. . ' - Dick. Turn it off. 'no longer will the Caped Crusader' 'and his youthful aid be able to combat crime in Gotham City. ' Find anything? Looks black as pitch, Dick. I've been through all my father's old law books. . I don't see we have a leg to stand on. A million dollars. It's not the money, Alfred. It's the idea of it. 'My identity revealed. ' My value as a secret crime-fighter ended. Everything I've trained myself for since my parents were murdered in the ashcan. Gone. Up the shoot. Well, sir, I do hope something can be worked out. If poor Mrs. Cooper were to find out what Master Dick has been doing on these supposed fishing trips of yours. . Listen, Bruce. I have an idea. Yes. Remember what the Riddler said when he slipped you this paper? '"When you chewed over this one, look for two others. "' - What do you guess he meant? - Two other riddles, of course. Exactly. And where can we look? What do we have with us which The Riddler gave us? Great Scott, Dick! Could there be secret writing on this document? To the Bat-cave. Look between the lines. "When is the time of a clock like the whistle of a train?" When it's two to two. - Too-too-too! - Right you are. Here comes another one. "What has neither flesh, bonenor nail yet has four fingers anda thumb?" - A glove, of course! - Could it be an address? I've got it. You've done it again, chump. Let's just hope we're not too late. Meanwhile, in an abandoned subway toolroom deep under Gotham City the secret headquarters of the infamous Molehill Mob. Watch them fish eggs, Molly. They're full of calories. You'll blow up like a balloon. - Who cares? I'm hungry. - I care. Get fat, you won't be able to get through the manholes. Then what use you'd be? Get up, stop that ridiculous bickering. Batman's had time to solve the clue. Hurry, into the tunnel. What foul trickery are the fiendish Riddler and his evil Molehill Mob up to now? Odd, the new discotheque? What's The Riddler's game? Hold up the wealthy patrons? Could be. It's a favorite haunt of high society. Sorry, Batman. I'm afraid the boy is underage. It's the law. Very odd. This could be a plot to separate us. I can take care of myself, Batman. You go inside. I'll pull into the lot and watch in the Bat-scope. Alright. Thanks, Robin will take it. Gleeps! It's Batman. Anything I can do for you, sir? Check your cape? Ringside table, Batman? Uh, just looking, thanks. I'll stand at the bar. I shouldn't wish to attract attention. A large fresh orange juice, please. Yes, sir. Looking for a friend? Maybe you can help me. I've got a problem. Why is a quarrel like a bargain? Well, well. What master taught you to riddle? The answer is it takes two to make it. Like beautiful music, like the dance. Shall we? Your orange juice, sir. Batman special. What's your name? Molly. You interest me, strangely. 'I accept your invitation. ' You shake a pretty mean cape, Batman. It's nothing, it's. . Yes. Yes. Well, I. . My, my drink. . Doped! I'll take the Batmobile too. - What about Molly and me? - The manhole, stupid. That thing's alive. Every copper in town will see them fireworks. Quickly, the kid. Grab the kid. If I can't take the dratted thing, I'llburn it up! Curses! This got more lives than a cat! Come on! Officers, out of my way. They've got Robin. Out of my way I said. I've got to go after Robin. Hand me the key, Batman. You're in no condition to drive. Yes, of course, Officer. You're entirely correct. Look. The Bat-signal from the roof of City Hall. The commissioner's trying to call Batman. In his shape, kinder not tell him. Where have they got Robin? Put him on a table and strap him down. Mol. Yes, doctor. At last. At last, Boy Wonder Robin. At last, Boy Wonder Robin. You and the Caped Crusader bothare set for the final bow. Will Robin escape? Can Batman find him in time? Is this the ghastly end for our Dynamic Duo? Answers tomorrow night! Same time, same channel. One hint the worst is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman 
NARRATOR". As you may recall, we last left Batman sealed in an Egyptian sarcophagus five feet under water. For you, several hours have passed. For our heroes, not one second. We just may be witnessing the final chapter in Batman's brave life. Don't move an inch. The most incredible occurrences have yet to occur incredibly. The die is cast, Tutlings. Never again will Batman poke his bony beak into my business or anybody else's business for that matter. Ah! Don't work yourself into a flap, spunky. He's drowned, not even brat-to-bat resuscitation can help him now. Now I must get back to the throne room and see if my adored Cleopatra has changed her mind in the dungeon. I still don't see what that dame has that I don't. Well, whatever it is, she's had it centuries longer than you. You've seen the last of that vatted calf. Morse Batcode? Good heavens. You're in big trouble, King Tut. Kidnapping, murder, grand theft and malicious mischief. You're a party-pooper, Cleo. Now you see we've had our first spat. All right, fellows, gather up yon bird boy and bring the Tut Truck round to the front entrance. We go now to the royal oil boiling room. A perfect place to make our nuptial arrangements. Ugh. Aren't going to be any nuptial arrangements. I wanna go home. Oh, and so you shall, my little lily of the valley of the kings. In gloriously triumphant splendor to the Nile. My father hears about this, he's gonna run you out of town on an Egyptian rail. Your father, dear Cleopatra, lies immobile and in the grave in Rama, great city of the Sahara. When we get to the royal oil boiling room be sure to prepare some real boiling royal boiling oil to boil the boy wonder in royally. Oh, sir. Oh, come on. Face it, Cleo. Fate has pushed us together and no man can split us asunder. For the last time, I am not Cleopatra and you certainly are not King Tut. Bite your tongue. She speaks heresy, omnipotent one. Lord Chancellor, you don't understand women. Beneath it all, she's aflame with love for me. Yuck. Reach your heart out. Please, I beg of you. Next to Bruce Wayne, my father is probably the wealthiest man in Gotham City. He'll pay you anything if you'll just let me go. She speaks with straight tongue, sire. John E. Carson has tons of the stuff. We could make a good deal. The market is strong for young heiresses right now. Silence, Tutlings. There will be no deal consummated until after our marriage. - I'll do anything if you'll call my father. - Mmm. Oh, thank heavens. You're alive, sir. Just barely, Alfred. I came as soon as I received your Morse Batcode message. It was really most propitious that I happened to be dusting the Batcave when you sent it. I counted on your love for your work. I don't understand how you managed to survive with no air and for such a great length of time, sir. I put myself in a trance not unlike the Indian fakirs. It required extreme concentration. I was able to slow my heart and respiratory systems to a crawl. But you were without air for nearly an hour, sir. Yes, I know of one fakir who was buried for three years. Indeed, sir. Yes, it must have been a remarkable demonstration of self-control. Where's Robin? King Tut removed him from the premises, where I don't know. Oh, yes. We must find him. To the Batcave. So won't you please call my father, little baby, hm? I promise you he'll make you a very rich man. Possessing you is all I want. A boy couldn't ask for anything more. Will you call him, please? Pretty please? Would you? All right. But I insist that he stay away until after the wedding. Oh, I promise. I promise. - Agreed? -Oh, yes. Agreed. Put her there. - Hello? -Hello? Hello, Dad. This is your future son-in-law. What? I'm sure you'll be happy to welcome me into your family. I come from good stock. My father was a king, grandfather before him, so am I. Leaving out your larcenous lineage what have you done with and or to my daughter? I'm safe, Daddy. And she'll remain safe for the paltry sum of $8,300,487 and 12 cents, queen's ransom. Why such an uneven amount? I need it to pay off the mortgage on the pyramids. The interest rate over 3400 years is positively usurious. Very well. As long as she's in no danger, no sum of money is too great. But what about arrangements? It will take me a while to get that much cash. - We'll have to deal through an intermediary. -I have an idea. My company sponsors the daily Jolly Jackson Phone Jockey radio show. When I've collected that much money, I'll call in and I'll say, "The sleet in Crete is never very neat. " - I think you've got it. -Keep listening to the program. Operator, get me Commissioner Gordon. So Tut plans to boil Robin in oil, eh? I did hear him mention something to that effect, sir through the skylight. Also, as I now recall, something about his royal oil boiling room. Mm-hm. We'll soon see about his monstrous scheme. And next, where he plans to perpetrate it. Drawing upon my vast storehouse of chemical knowledge I'm herein concocting an alchemist fluid which will neutralize the boiling oil. What exactly does it do, sir? I'm not quite sure, Alfred. It's the first time I've ever tried this experiment. But I think in the end, it should produce foam rubber. - Foam rubber, sir? -Yes, Alfred. From a tiny capsule like that? The size of the package, Alfred, is in no way any indication of the value of its contents. Of course, sir. Heh. Very apt. Yes, commissioner. Urn, first, Batman, will you be talking to Bruce Wayne? I occasionally run into him, commissioner. Why? I'm worried about my daughter Barbara. How is she involved in all this? Well, as Bruce Wayne knows, she's away at college, she'll be graduating shortly and I'd hate to think that some of the dire happenings which have happened to that fine professor of Egyptology could also happen to my beloved daughter at her school. I rather doubt that your daughter Barbara is going to get conked on the head and turned into a long-dead Egyptian ruler, commissioner. Heh, heh. I know it sounds a little farfetched but she's an only child and of course, my pride and joy. I just need a little reassurance. If I see Bruce Wayne, I'll ask him to call you. He knows more about the present American collegiate scene than I do. I'd be most grateful, Batman. You said that was first, commissioner, what's second? Second? Oh, yes. Of course. Forgive me. I must not let my personal concerns conflict with my public problems. Are you familiar with Jolly Jackson, the Phone Jockey? Isn't he the man who takes calls from people and then insults them on the air? Exactly. And here's our predicament Our number is klondike-5-8-2-5-7. The program is "Open Mouth. " - Hello. -Mr. Jackson, this is Batman. Sorry about that. I had to cut you off the air. No names. But it's important that my message be heard. You know, you're the eighth person that called today claiming to be Batman. It used to be Napoleon. Now it's Batman. But I'm really Batman and I have a message for King Tut. King Tut'? Listen, I'm no Egyptian phone jockey, bub. Maybe not, but this is a matter of life and death. Well, you all say the same thing. All right, listen, if you're really Batman then you're a very brainy guy, right? Go on. Tell me who said, "Biography should be written by an acute enemy"? Arthur James Balfour, born 1848, died 1930. He was quoted by S. K. Ratcliffe in the London Observer, January 30, 1927. Friends, we have a very special guest on the line. A great and good friend of yours truly. Batman. He has a message for you. Fire away, caped crusader. This message is for King Tut only. I request all other citizens of Gotham City to comply with my wishes and shut their radios off for the next 30 seconds. Curse you, Batman. May you fall down a flight of stairs and break every tooth in your head except one and in that, may you have a toothache for the rest of your life which won't be very long. Okay, you can turn your radios up again. Good. For those of you who didn't hear what Batman had to say, it was very interesting. And for those of you who didn't turn your radios off: Naughty, naughty. Hello, Jolly Jackson on the line. Can I help you? Yeah. This is King Tut speaking. Well, here we go again. - Tell that repulsive rodent to-- -Hold on a second, Tutsy. Sorry to do this, friends but would you mind turning your radios off again for a few seconds more. Go ahead, sweetheart. Tell that blue beanbag to bring the money to the royal oil boiling room in the abandoned boiler works in the old Boylston section of the city tonight. Alone. And you can also tell him to - Oh, oh. Such language. -Any result, sir? Yes, Alfred, just as you recalled and I suspected Tut's holding the girl in the abandoned boiler works. Holy steam valve. Sorry, sir, it just slipped out. It must be because Master Robin's uppermost in my thoughts at the moment. And in mine, Alfred. You mind the store. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in the royal oil boiling room adjacent to the vacant vat factory Ah! I knew I should have used vegetable oil, it's not hot enough yet. Only a few more minutes until countdown. I think there's enough room in the vat for Batman, don't you? About Batman, sire I thought we'd rid ourselves of him once already this evening. True. But the caped conniver seems to have a penchant for escaping from tight places. He'll not escape this one. Before this night is out I shall revel in the sight of a big, crisp, polyunsaturated bat. And that goes for his sickening sidekick too. The banks were all closed. The most I could muster was slightly more than 6 million. That's not enough. That fiend demanded $8,300,487 and 12 cents and not a penny less. What can I do? For once, I just don't know. Do you think he'd accept a check for the difference? It's worth a try. Batman, please promise you'll do everything in your power to bring her home safely. She's the only daughter I have and I love her very dearly. You have my word, Mr. Carson. This ransom will break me, but I don't care. Strange. I was under the impression that you were a multi-multimillionaire. Everybody thinks so. But all I have in the world is now in your hands. I had hoped to arrange a match between Lisa and Bruce Wayne. The combination of our fortunes would put me back on top and give me room to manipulate. -A marriage of convenience, eh? It goes on all the time among the upper classes. Normally, I wouldn't think of Bruce Wayne as a husband for Lisa. Well, he's a nice enough fellow, but he's just not marriage material for a girl like Lisa. Actually, you're more her style. Me? I'm afraid not, Mr. Carson. My heart is already pledged to crime-fighting. No. No time to tarry. Lest we forget, lives are at stake. - Robin. -Yes. Is there any hope? For you maybe, but I think my goose is cooked. Listen, kid. You want out of here, right? Of course I do. My father will send the ransom money but I'm not so sure King Tut will release me. Knowing what kind of fink he is, I'm positive he'll grab you and the loot. You're going to help us? Frankly, Robin, I don't give a darn about you but I want her out of here. King Tut may be fat, lazy and extremely rude, but he's all I have. And with her here I don't even have that. Seize them. Oh. My queen is disloyal, the handmaiden is a traitor and everybody is being mean to me. Very well, you have insulted your king. So as soon as Batman and Robin have been fricasseed you'll both join them in yonder pot. You'll answer to Batman for this. "You'll answer to Batman for this. " You big tattletale. Boiling in oil. One of my dear father's favorite spectator sports. Only you won't be a spectator, Batboy. According to my master plan, the cowled cornball should be arriving momentarily. - With the money. -We'll clobber him. No, no violence. I can't stand violence. But I like torture. It's good, clean fun. He'll be joining his caped crony in a double birdbath. Didn't you find that funny? The king has made a yuk. Laugh now. Ha, ha, ha! Slave girls, ho. And ten, nine eight seven, six, five four, three, two one, zero. Ugh! Into the oil. Call the commissioner. Tell him Chief O'Hara and his men can come right over. Batman, how can I ever thank you? Having you back with your father and Bruce Wayne is thanks enough for me. But what's gonna happen to me? Don't worry, Neila. Everything is going to be all right. Bat. The new curriculum includes a trip to the archaeological museum and Oh. - Did I do it again? -You certainly did. - I hurt anybody? -Only yourself, professor. - Only yourself. -I know. Oh, I hope the board of regents will understand that a criminal alter ego is not an easy thing to overcome. As a crazed criminal, professor your alter ego would have been dealt with justly, but firmly, for surely no man is above the law and no man is below it. It's been a lovely evening, Bruce. Yes, I've had a wonderful time too it's just too bad our date had to be spread over two nights. But King Tut had other plans for you. How is the poor, deluded man? I understand he's doing quite well. He's undergoing therapy to cure his ailment. When he's not functioning as King Tut, he's really quite normal. All of us have alter egos we submerge. True, so true. Would you like to come in for a glass of milk and cookies? I'm afraid it's rather late. Why, it's 10:30. On. All right. Will you call me again? I wonder if that would be wise, Lisa, you're a very beautiful woman and you'd make some lucky man a marvelous wife. Unfortunately, I'm not that man. You see, the Wayne foundation is my wife. You're just wasting your time with me. I don't think it's wasting time, Bruce. It's been very nice knowing you, Lisa. Don't I get a goodbye kiss? A kiss? Mm-hm. Well, if you insist. I do. Milk and cookies, did you say? I made the cookies myself. Man cannot live by crime-fighting alone. 
Batman A beautiful Wednesday afternoon in Gotham city. Matinee day at this theatre. In a moment, the play goers will be coming out for a refreshing orange drink. But watch closely. There may be a drama that's not on the program. So, what's superior to this sort of thing, one usually sees? Oh, yes, infinitely. And the leading man, my dear, Mrs. Van Climber. His tremendous power. Absolutely inspired, my dear Penguin. It's a penetrating documentary in our time. It's a mirror of a cliched minds of our sadly weakened moral fiber. Wouldn't you say so? Oh! Hands up everybody and you won't get hurt. I ain't kidding. Do as he says, Penguin. He's a desperate man. Ah. You. 'Unhook that ruby pendant. ' Throw it here. - Outrageous monster. - Shh. He'll hear you. Back away everybody! Back away! You, knave thief, surrender! Wise guy, huh? Take this. Jumpin' jeepers! A bulletproof umbrella! Ah! Ms. Starr. - Uh. - May I? Thank you. Yeah. Oh! How can I ever, ever thank you? Yeah. Oh! What? The Penguin prevented a crime? That waddling pompous master of foul play? It's true, commissioner. And who do you think, the necklace belongs to? Ms. Sophia Starr. Sophia Starr? Beauteous queen of Gotham City society? That's her. They left the theatre hand in hand. Ominous, most ominous. What do you think it means, commissioner? Since it involves The Penguin, there is only one man who can answer that question. And answer it in time. The Caped Crusader. Alright, commissioner, I'll fetch him for you. And in Wayne Manor, where young Dick Grayson practices his putting under the watchful eye of his guardian millionaire Bruce Wayne and his doting Aunt Harriet. Ow! Missed that one. Precision, Dick. Precision. The key tosuccess in life and as well in sports. And excuse me, sir, but there's a telephone call for you. A certain Mr. Rime. - Rime? - Yes, sir. Mr. K Rime, if you understand me. Of course. Mr. K Rime with the red hot line of investments for the Wayne foundation. Precisely, sir. Dick, it's about time you started learning something 'about the elements of investment. ' We may be a while, Aunt Harriet. Mr. K Rime might want us to visit him at the stock exchange. So long, Aunt Harriet, See you later. Mercy me. What an unfortunate name for an investment councilor. K Rime. Sounds like crime! Isn't that funny, Alfred? I'd be very careful about him if I were Bruce. Indeed, madam. Yes, commissioner. A strange and troubling turn of events, Batman. You have a competitor in crime fighting. The Penguin! We're on our way. The Penguin. Holy nick of time. Lucky for us we just finished installing the bulletproof windshield in the Batmobile. Not so lucky for The Penguin. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman nana nana nana nana nana nana na Batman Thanks, commissioner. We got the picture. I'll call you back if Batman has any ideas. What do you think, Batman? Has The Penguin really gone straight? It's a tough one. When that bird turn snow white it could be merely a tricky white wash job. Right. But still, we've got to think of his records since he last left prison. Clean as a whistle, it seems. Accepted in the best circles. Not even a ticket for jaywalking. Could it be that, he is reformed? Or only pretending to reform. Stalking his next victim under the false colors of a crime fighter. How the heck do we find out? - I have an idea. - What, Batman? Say that caper at the theatre was a Penguin's employee. And that crook he caught must've been an accomplice, right? On the nose. Call the commissioner. Have him give that crook a grilling. We'll be there in time for the kill. Alright, I'll ask you one more time. How long have you known The Penguin? - Who? - Quit lying, you cheap hoodlum. He paid you to pull that job. Told you to keep your mouth shut. Promised to cut you on the big job later. You guys must read too many comic books or something. Hold it, Chief O'Hara, no rough stuff. It's our duty to abide by the rules. Now, this lying is useless. Besides. We have evidence. - Evidence? - The bulletproof umbrella. Why would The Penguin have carried a bulletproof umbrella to a matinee unless he expected a machine gun attack. Who knows? Ask him. A hard baked cookie, this one. Covered with armor plate icing Let's give him a turn, shall we? 'Hey. ' 'What's the matter, sonny? Scared of the dark?' Ah! Help, there's bats loose in here. Holy knock-out drops. The miserable weakling, faded, dead away. Looks like, you over-did it, Batman. Only one thing to do now. Find Penguin himself. Put the blocks to him. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, lieutenant. We have a report from the tail we put on The Penguin. He just entered the Gotham City Millionaire's club. Holy Jackpot. That bird of prey, loose among the golden geese. There's only one way to find out. Call the parking lot. Have 'em clear all the exits for the Batmobile. Meanwhile, in the steam room of the super exclusive Gotham Millionaire's club. A strange disquieting scene. Leave that man alone you criminals. - Take him out of here. - Look out. Watch out! - Quick. - More steam. Roger. 'That's got it. ' A snatch in the fog, eh? Alas, you sad, dim-witted ruffian! - The smoke screen. - It's gone. Jesus. Oh, thank you, sir. They tried to kidnap me. It's alright, Reggie, my boy. You are safe now. You're with The Penguin. Put up your flippers, Penguin. We caught you with your feathers down. Kidnapping. One false move and you get the batarang. Hello, my esteemed colleagues in crime fighting. The droll deceivers, the dynamic duo. Batman, listen. You've got it all wrong. The Penguin saved me from being kidnapped. Saved you? I swear to you, old boy. Some villains were trying to abduct me under the cover of a steam screen. And heaven knows how he did it. This delightful bird-like chaps suddenly dispelled the steam and the criminals took to their heels. Elementary, my dear, Reggie. My ubiquitous umbrella was fortunately loaded with colored dry ice. When I discharged the jet, the vapor was instantly condensed. Something fishy here. There's sure is. He must have known about the supposed kidnapping. Otherwise, why would he be carrying an umbrella loaded with dry ice? The reason is the season, Batman. What? This prematurely hot weather annoys me. Being a Penguin is kind of a bird, I hate hot weather. So what could be more natural than I should carry an umbrella loaded with dry ice? Oh, yeah. If you hate the heat so much, what you doing in a steam room? I ask you, is that an ethical question? Between crime fighters, competitors, you might say. You pompous, taunting creature! Well, I'm sorry I must fly. I'm very busy. I have little rendezvous with Sophia Starr. We have some arrangements to make. - Arrangements? - For her jewels. I'm taking over their protection. I'm gonna give you my card. Adieu. Come on, my dear boy. Well, you saved my life, if there's anything I can do. . Penguin Protective Agency Incorporated. Holy leopard! What a change of spots. The Penguin. In business as a private eye. Hiring him to guard jewels is like. . trusting a lethal lettuce to a rabbit. Let's race back and give Ms. Starr a warning. Nuisance. She's smitten with him. She'd scoff at us. So what do we do? We can't protect her. We can save her jewels at the same time set a trap. Great. How? We substitute fake jewels with the real ones, Robin. Treat it in a reactor to leave radioactive traces of the thief. Terrific! There's just one problem. 'To make copies. ' I dunno what the real ones look like. Correct. Has to look at them. That would tip Penguin off. Pickup the Bat-phone and call Alfred. Tell him to wait for us in the Bat-cave. Alfred is going to be our secret undercover agent. What? Reggie Rich gave you a check for $10,000 and you tore it up? Indeed. And right in front of his very eye. You know somethin', this plan of being a straight guy must have unhinged Penguin's mind. No, you, butt-brain. What's 10,000, when I aim at millions? Confidence. That's is what I'm stealing from these dupes. Confidence and pride in The Penguin. And they'll end up handing me their treasure on a silver plate. - Yeah, but I wonder. . - You wonder, what? Don't get mad at me Penguin but. . I wonder what Batman and Robin's gonna say about that. Piddling pair will be punctured! Now and forever. Then, no offence, Penguin, but we heard you sing that song before. We always end up singing the anvil chorus in the pen. Not this time, you see. I have planted a seed in their mind. I've planted the erroneous idea that I'm going to steal the jewels of Sophia Starr. You mean, you ain't? No! I'm not. I delight in the devious, I obviate the obvious. They're misreading my intentions. They're going to lay a trap for me. A trap which when it springs. . And Batman and Robin will never come back Batman and Robin will never. . Well, farewell, my fine fostered fates. Your mind has tore. I'm going to see our shining star, Sophia Starr. What an counter-plot. Here's Alfred, carrying out a vital but risky chore. In the guise of a man from Floyds Insurance Limited. Excellent! I think that just about does it, Ms. Starr. You're sure, there's nothing else you want? No, thank you. That would just complete our records. Beg your pardon, Pengy darling. What offends me to the quick. An insurance company worrying about the safety of your jewels while they are under my guardianship. One can never be too secure, can one, Mr. Penguin? With the world these days so full of predators. Great Scott, Alfred. Have you forgotten? Batman told you to switch cigarette holders with The Penguin. You're meant to palm off the trick one with a tiny super powered transmitter inside. Quick! Before it's too late. Create that diversion. Good day, Ms. Starr. 'Great heavens!' The anti-theft system built into my carrying case it went off accidently. Don't panic. I can fix that. 'There! Neutralized. ' Buy my high powered de-magnetizer coil. Oh, Pengy. 'You're fantastic. ' 'No trouble at all. ' 'Where there's no end to your resourcefulness. ' 'Thank you, my love, thank you. ' - Oh, Pengy. - Ha ha ha. Oh, look, the handle of your umbrella. What? 'Sound! My secret radio detector. ' Somebody has planted an electronic bug in this room. Huh? Eh. Ah. So, you switched cigarette holders, did ya? Ah. I think not. Out with you, criminal. Who are you working for? It can happen to the best of us, Mr. Penguin. One moment everything is going smoothly. And the next, fate pulls the rug out from under us. - Ah! Pengy - Good day, miss. Oh, Pengy, dear. Pengy, my poor darling. Who cares about him? Are you alright? Vengeance! Failure, sir. Utter failure. That's not true, Alfred. Of course not. Important thing was to get this picture of Sophia's jewels. You got it. Sure you did. And we already made a complete set of fake copies. Thanks to you, we may be able to avert a gigantic robbery. Robin, grab those fake jewels. We must strike before The Penguin does. Let's go. We're sure taking a chance, Batman. What's the matter? Souls of your boots slippery? Heck no! I mean when we put the fake jewels in Ms. Starr's safe. Take the real one's out. We could be nailed as crooks. That's the chance we have to take. In our well ordered society protection of private property is essential. Yes, you're right, Batman. That's the keystone of all law and order. Let's go, chum. The safe should be behind that picture. Coast seems clear. Turn off the electric iron looping on it. Neutralize the alarm. I'll listen to the tumblers. Roger. Perfect. Tumblers are falling into place. Caught you, you thieves. One move and you're a dead duo. Holy. Bat-trap! Let's fight our way outta this. Ah! Whoa! Ah. They getting out the window. Let 'em go, they won't get far. Pengy dear, you alright? Sophia, my dear, you call the police. I'll call the Gotham City Times. Shocking! shocking! How can a responsible press print such an item? But you can't blame the papers, commissioner. Things sure look dark for Batman when the lights went on. Yes, but still how could a sane person think Batman a criminal? How ungrateful the public is! Yes, put him on. It's Penguin. Good morning, commissioner. Have you snared that costumed crooks yet? They're still at large, Penguin. Well, that's very lax of you, commissioner. I do hope that they won't burst in tonight and terrorize our party. Your party? Yes. Anyway, you're invited. Might come, if you like it. Some of my influential friends are giving a gala benefit for the P. P. A. . That's the Penguin's Protective Agency. Yes. We have taken over the Gotham amusement pier. Should be amusing. You you abominable avian! - Yes, Commissioner. - Gotham amusement pier tonight. - Penguin is tossing a party. - Interesting. You better not be there, Batman. If you are spotted, I'll have to arrest you. It's our only hope, Robin. We'll have to catch Penguin in something crooked that he won't be able to press that warrant for our arrest. - Have an awful thought, Batman. - What? What if Penguin really has gone straight? - Right! - What do you think, Batman? He's with Sophia Starr and she's wearing those priceless diamonds. Yeah, I have a strange feeling, It's time for the kill. Gee, that cement-filled umbrella sure cooled them off. Well done, my finks, well done. What now, Penguin? String them up here back of the shooting gallery directly behind the cut-outs. - Right. - Now, one small detail. Our umbrella pop guns, take out the pellets. Introduce real bullets. Ha ha ha. You, eh, challenge us, Penguin? I certainly do. Knowing you gentlemen to be of sporting blood I know that you'll play this exquisite of the game with me. If you'll burst those two red balloons on the first round. I'll donate 1000 dollars to your police benevolent fund. 'That's too easy, Penguin. Much too easy' 'There must be a catch towards somewhere. ' 'No, catch whatsoever. If you shoot those two red balloons' you will be doing Gotham City a gigantic favor. Doing the city a big favor? What the devil? Why not? - Give us the guns, Penguin. - Give them the umbrella gun. Batman and Robin, a swinging pair of dead ducks! What on earth can save them? Don't shoot, Commissioner! Don't shoot! All set, gentlemen? We're set. Now, on my instructions. Ready? Aim. Good grief! Good night! Double funeral tomorrow. Same bat-time, same bat-channel. Can you see any way out?

Batman Gotham City International Airport. A pleasant day for an important arrival. Gentlemen, please. A little room for the king. Welcome to Gotham City, Your Highness. This has been a long awaited pleasure. Thank you, my friends. But the pleasure is entirely mine. I've heard wonderful things about your city. How was your flight, Your Majesty. Bumpy. Oh, uh. . Except when we crossed into American territory then it was smooth. I'd like to ask-- The limousine's waiting, Your Majesty. I'm sure you'd like to go to the hotel. Fine, fine. Oh, uh. . May I take that for you? No-no, no thank you. No. No offense, but it's too important. I shall carry it with me until the presentation. Your Majesty. . on behalf of the Welcoming Committee I'd like to present you with these roses. Well, thank you, young lady. Thank you very much. Shy little thing, isn't she? These flowers are certainly. . Make anything out of it, Chief O'Hara? There's no doubt about it. . The Riddler that infernal Prince of Puzzlers as you call him is up to his old tricks. And what will those tricks be, chief? "When is a person like a piece of wood?" What does it mean? I wish I knew, commissioner. I wish I knew. Anyone else think they can make any sense out of it? Well, there is one man who might be able to. I have a fine police force here, yet I have no alternative but to call on his services once again. Long time ago, I gave up trying to figure out who he was I owe him too much for that. We all owe him a very great deal. And in Wayne Manor stately and secure home of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward Dick Grayson. I'll beckon him, sir, immediately. You think? That's mateold chum. Gosh, Bruce. Why can't I ever beat you? You have onseveral occasions. Only when your mind is on important matters. . Excuse me for interrupting, sir. - But it's the Batphone. - Oh, boy! Oops! Sorry, Aunt Harriet. I didn't mean to scare you. Mercy alive! If I didn't know you two better I'd think you were up to something. What do you mean, Aunt Harriet? Well, it's just that every once in awhile you come zooming out of this room like jet planes practically knocking me over and then rushing out with hardly any explanation. There's no mystery, Aunt Harriet. Dick and I just played a game of chess and we agreed that if I won, he'd do some studying. If he won, we'd go fishing. Bye, dear. Yes, commissioner. Batman, I'm having trouble. . with a riddle. Him again. We'll be right over. To the Batpoles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na Batman It's The Riddler. His modus operandi alright. I agree. Nobody else would use such a spectacular and bizarre method to flaunt a puzzle. What the devil is the culprit trying to tell us? The riddle itself is pretty basic. A person is a piece of wood when he's a ruler. You figure it has something to do with King Boris. - Maybe. - Good thinking, Robin. But no attempt was made to abduct or to harm him. Wood, ruler, king. Tsk. A chess king. The International Chess Tournament tonight. Twenty five thousand dollars in prize money. Boy Wonder, you've done it again. I think this thing is much bigger than that. The Riddler goes after millions not thousands. He loves to dazzle us with his fancy footwork. In any case, assign an extra squad of men to cover the place. - What is King Boris' itinerary? - He's here on a goodwill visit. Among other things he's to be an honorary judge at the Miss Galaxy finals tomorrow. And the following day will appear at the Queen of Freedom Monument. I saw that in the papers. He's going to present the Museum of Fame with a doll-sized replica of the Queen of Freedom. Queen? A queen can be a ruler. - That's it. - What queen? There is no queen, the king ain't married. There will be tomorrow. A new queen of beauty. They're gonna crown her with a priceless diamond and emerald tiara. Exactly, Robin. It's my guess that our puzzling friend will try to steal it. Ah, now, we're getting somewhere. 'I'll have that place blocked so tight. . ' On the contrary. . I think we should let The Riddler steal the tiara. Ladies and gentlemen, before I announce this year's winner I shall like to introduce you to last year's Miss Galaxy. She is Jackie Sands. This is it. The moment you've all been waiting for. The moment one of these girls has been waiting for. Our moment of truth. Knowing that arch-villain The Riddler I'm almost positive he'll show up for this event. We'll soon find out. Miss Galaxy will be crowned any moment. The new Miss Galaxy Queen of Beauty is. . Southern City's own sparkling-eyed beauty Julia Davis. - Congratulations, Julia. - Thank you. Miss Galaxy. . it is with great pleasure that I crown you Queen of Beauty with this magnificent diamond and emerald tiara. - Oh! Thank you. - Isn't she beautiful? 'Miss Galaxy. ' He's in for quite a surprise when he discovers I substituted a fake tiara for the real one. Too bad we didn't get a chance to paste The Riddler. We might yet. Don't forget I placed a homing transmitter in the band of that tiara. It'll lead us right to his hideout. Yes. Now, to the Batmobile. Wait, Robin. Look. Holy sewer pipe! What's he up to? You're slipping, Batman. I knew it was a phony crown all the time. Riddle me this, crime fighter. What room can no one enter? If you figure it out look for another royal riddle in this crown. That ends any chance of tracking him with the homing device. Shall we after him in the manhole? We'll never find him. There're hundreds of tunnels down here. A riddle a day keeps The Riddler away. What? Once, a long time ago The Riddler made the mistake of telling me that. It means as long as he dishes out riddles, he's. . he's not finished with his plot. When the riddles stop that's when he's ready for his final caper. Then he told the truth. That diamond tiara wasn't what he was really after. Right, Robin. But we have two more riddles to tell us what it may be. Now. First clue was What room can no one enter? A mushroom. Agreed. Uh, the second one. Read it again. "What is the beginning of eternity "the end of time and space beginning of every end and the end of every race?" Golly, Batman. It doesn't seem to make sense. Let's see. If your first answer, a mushroom was correct. . Why, that's it. - Of course. - You have it? What was it The Riddler said when he threw back the tiara? "There's a royal riddle in this crown. " Look up the address of the Royal Mushroom Club. There are some things we can do the good old-fashion way. Using the telephone book. Oh! I must be getting lazy. Meanwhile, in another cave, a rat cave dreary hideout of the sinister River Rats Gang currently in the employ of The Riddler. What's this, River Rats? Munching cheese while there's work to be done? Sorry, Riddler, but we got hungry. Oh, indeed. Well, perhaps you'll lose your appetite when I deduct the cheese bill from your share of the profits. - How'd it go, chief? - Magnificent. Sumptuous. You should have seen the look on Batman's face when I threw the tiara. Now, my good rats. Now is the time to go to the Royal Mushroom Club. If Plan 13-Z goes well, and I'm sure it will the finest achievement in crime shall be culminated tonight. The end of Batman and Robin. And later, at the Royal Mushroom Club. . Magnificent. What a fantastic duplication. Those jewels, it must be worth a fortune. Value was not the object. It's friendship that counts and admiration for your great country. To America! America. 'Mmm! What a delicious wine. ' Ho ho. Marvelous bouquet. The Royal Mushroom Club has some of the finest wines in the world. Right, Mr. Ambassador. Yes. Fine vintages and rare years indeed. Begging your pardon, Mr. Ambassador but we're every proud of our wine cellar. Perhaps His Majesty would like a tour? An excellent idea. I'm always interested in good wines. Like a small boy looking at expensive bicycles. Well then, let me lead the way. Batman! Robin! - Trouble or pleasure? - We're not sure yet. Is King Boris visiting here tonight? Why, yes. He just went for a tour of our wine cellar. Which way? Fastest way is down the stairs. Come on, Robin. We haven't a second to lose. Well, well. Chateau Le Duc '29. I didn't know there was any left. I'm very much impressed. Batman and Robin. This is an unexpected pleasure. Thank you. This isn't a social visit. - May we approach, King Boris? - It's an honor to meet you. How can I be of service? Your Majesty, you're in great danger here. May we escort you to your hotel? - Danger? That's ridiculous. - We thought so too, but then-- Oh, I've heard wondrous things about you, Batman. But, this time, I'm afraid you're wrong. First of all, I'm with friends. Second, there is no political threat against me I assure you. My country is small and harmless my people, content and happy. Who would want to. . The king! He's gone. What? Great Scott! A trapdoor! Does anyone know where this leads? I wasn't aware there was a trapdoor here. Come on, Robin. There might be an exit from outside the club. "Two steps to aid you with my plot. " That's no riddle. But those are. "How much dirt is in a hole three acres square and 200 feet deep?" None. Because it's a hole. I suggest that's a bit too elementary for our quizzical criminal. "If you're having difficulty with the first "perhaps your young friend can help you on this one. What won't run long without winding?" "What won't run long without winding?" Clock? Stairway! - A river? - The Gotham river. We'll soon find out. Come on, Robin. Back to the Batcave. Gotham City river bending and windingsections. Nothing there. - Negative again. - Hold it. I think we may have something. Let's take a closer look. That may be it. Gotham City Water and Power Plant exact location and size. 'This could be a clue. ' A hole three acres wide and 200 feet deep. I'll bet The Riddler and his gang are holing up with King Boris. Let's go and dig 'em out. And fast. And at the obsolete Water and Power Plant. . I don't know what kind of rogues you are but I demand that you release me this instant. Gee I never met royalty before. It's pretty thrilling. Royalty? You've never met royalty? And just whom do you think stands before you My cherub? I am the Prince of Puzzlers the Count of Conundrums 'the King of Crime. ' My whole court here, no one else. . It's a good idea hiding the Batmobile on that thicket. Nobody will spot it there. I hope nobody spots us climbing this wall. Why don't we just break in through the main entrance? Surprise attack style. Don't worry, we'll catch them off guard. Through the ventilating system? First, I wanna make sure we don't endanger King Boris when we make our entrance. Gosh! There could be diplomatic repercussions if we fail this time, Batman. That's not the point, Robin. What's important is that the world knows that all visitors to these teeming shores are safe. Be it a peasant or a king. Gee, Batman, I never thought of that. You're right. It's the very essence of our democracy. Darn it. . You have the Queen of Freedom replica what possible good can it do for you to keep me here? My fine sovereign friend. In your wildest imagination, you could never begin to conceive my ingenious stratagem. If not ransom, then what? You, my dear king, have been reduced to a pawn. An important pawn however. For you will be used to checkmate Batman 'and his preposterous Boy Wonder. ' 'When they show up. . ' then my men will escort you safely back to town. . with your statue. You want a piece of cheese? Not without a good vintage port, you lackey. To quote an old axiom "The finer the bait, the shorter the wait. " Hey, king. Uh, we shouldn't have to wait much longer. Batman fell for my clues. Alright, Riddler. Now you're going to fall right into the hands of the law. Now, Whitey. Batman, we're caught in this sticky trap. I-I-I can't get out of it. I-I can't move. Neither can I. It couldn't be more beautiful! Whoever heard of a bat caught in a spider's web? Whitey, Fangs! Be sure to strap them down good. I'm a man of my word. Whiskers! Whiskers, return the statue to His Majesty and take him back to town. Blindfolded of course. Oh, you were stupendous as a pawn, king. Batman and Robin played it right into my hands. Oh! Comfortable? Huh. Batman. . these driveshafts rotate that means the centrifugal force will tear the bones from your body. But before I start you spinning I'd like to spill off one last riddle. You might have about a minute to solve it before you die. Now, then. Why is a woman in love like a welder? Goodbye, Batman. Goodbye, Boy Wonder. Take it easyRobin. One bad turn deserves another. Batman and Robin to die? Things certainly are turning the wrong way for them. Is this really the end? Unbelievable! If you care for Batman and Robin keep hoping 'til tomorrow night. Same time. Same Bat-channel. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na Batman 
The luxury liner S. S. Gotham Queen is only hours out of Gotham City. Her passengers are enjoying a final meal on-board little knowing it could well be their final meal. -It's been a lovely voyage, Captain Carlisle. -And a great pleasure for me, Ms. Glaze. Seldom have I had a passenger list including a world famous ice skating star such as yourself. And an international scientist from Iceland such as Professor lsaacson to keep me company. Your field must be fascinating, professor. Just what is this formula you're taking to Gotham City? To the world it's a secret formula, Ms. Glaze. But to you, it's a formula for making instant ice. I'll be working in an advisory capacity with the Bruce Wayne Foundation. What a coincidence. I'm opening tonight in an ice revue at the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena. An iceberg? - Just outside the Gotham City Harbor? -And dead ahead. Reverse engines. I'll tell Captain Carlisle at once. NARRATOR". But the location of this iceberg isn't the only strange thing about it. It's what's inside the iceberg in Mr. Freeze's unique, new hideout below the water line. Our iceberg's been sighted. But too late for the Gotham Queen, I'm afraid. Activate the ice magnets. We'll pull her directly into our iceberg. And I'm sure we'll be hearing from Ms. Glacia, shortly. Iceberg. Iceberg? Professor lsaacson is at the captain's table -in the ship's dining salon, darling. - Thank you, Glacia. Good, the ship's almost against the iceberg. Get some more men, go up the ice ladders. When the ship's secure, leap aboard. Isaacson's at the captain's table. Bring him back here. Victory at last. Soon I'll be able to cover the entire world with an instant ice cap. And then you say the kidnappers disappeared back into the iceberg and somehow the Gotham Queen was released. We'll ride with the wind, commissioner. To the Batpoles. NARRATOR". But while the Batmobile glissades toward police headquarters Mr. Freeze is having his own icy sport with Professor lsaacson. Your secret formula for frozen ice, professor, that's what I want. Where is it? You mean it isn't written down? To keep it a secret formula, it's bottled up in here and memory is a strange and intangible thing you frosty-faced fool. And mine won't work at your command. We'll see about that, professor. Frosty, Chilblains? Dismantle this hideout. Remove all evidence of our ever having been here. We'll take this perverse professor back to Gotham City and ice him. I have a chilling scheme by which I'll not only gain my ends but permanently deep-freeze the Dynamic Duo. Go. Ha, ha. Asoulda, darling. I am going to take you with me. This little homing seal will come in quite handy in my little ice escapade. Saints preserve us, who else could it be but that ice-devil incarnate, Mr. Freeze? Nobody else, Chief O'Hara. Did you talk to the ship's captain after the Gotham Queen made port, commissioner? And he had nothing to add to the preposterous story though I may have anticipated you, Batman. The liner's passenger list in case Mr. Freeze had an accomplice aboard. May we take this passenger list with us? Might provide us with a clue. To the Batcave. It looked as though we were in for a long cold winter, commissioner. But now, I think we're due for a sudden change in the weather. Begorra. NARRATOR". While in Mr. Freeze's present hideout directly under the rink of the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena Darling, your ingenuity is amazing. Who else would have thought of a hideaway here of all places? The jet nozzles in this collar keep me permanently in a subzero temperature, Glacia and allow me to stay alive. But everyone functions better in a cool environment. Speaking of cool environments Frosty, what does that thermometer read in the Quick Freezer? Two hundred below, boss. Dead on the cold nose. Professor lsaacson can't or won't reveal his secret formula to me. - I'm freezing it out of him in the Quick Freezer. -Oh, how lovely. Well, I must get upstairs for rehearsal. I'll be thinking of you tonight while I execute my famous waltzing arabesque directly over your head. It's time for your supper, Asoulda. Soon as it's dark, I have a little errand for you to go on. Mm? Look at the Batcomputer work on that passenger list. Here's the passengers on C-Deck. All members of a fireplace equipment dealer's tour. Unlikely cohorts of Mr. Freeze. What about this? Suite A, boat deck, Collin Caldwell? Mm. An appropriate name, but Mr. Coldwell is president of the Coldwell Furnace Company and scarcely a suspect. Emma Strunk. - What was that? -Emma Strunk, nothing there. Just a second, Robin. Emma Strunk, I believe, was born Emma Strunk and later changed her name to Glacia Glaze. - Holy ice skates. -Exactly. A world renown skating queen. No doubt she booked passage under the name of Emma Strunk in order to avoid publicity. Once on board of course, she would have been recognized. Yes, old chum, I have a strange feeling That Glacia Glaze was Mr. Freeze's accomplice on the Gotham Queen. But what would a talented, beautiful, famous star like Glacia Glaze see in frostbitten Freeze? The famous Rabelais has already answered that for you, Robin, with his great wit. "To each his own," as the woman said when she kissed her cow. Gosh, Batman, that's sure great wit, all right. And this could be just the break we and Bruce Wayne are looking for. - Bruce Wayne? -Ms. Glaze is opening in a new ice revue tonight at the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena. In fact, Mr. Wayne is taking Mrs. Harriet Cooper a devotee of Ms. Glaze's backstage before the performance to meet the dazzling star. While Dick Grayson, I suppose, stays home and works on his essay on glaciers? Right again, Robin. Bonnie, the next time you send in an unannounced visitor you'd better send a tank of water and some live fish along with him. But this was attached to one of its flippers. Suffering icicles, it's a list of demands from Mr. Freeze. He's holding Professor lsaacson for ransom. At midnight, millionaire Bruce Wayne, head of the Wayne Foundation is to make a televised broadcast-- -From this office. that the money is ready to be paid. He'll only deal directly with Batman and Robin. They're to be ready at midnight too to act as intermediaries, otherwise-- Otherwise it may be the blackest midnight that Gotham City has ever known, Chief O'Hara. I'll call Batman on the red phone. - You get Mr. Wayne on the other. -Right. Yes, commissioner? Mr. Freeze wants what? Hello? I'll see if I can get him, Chief O'Hara. A moment, commissioner. Chief O'Hara, this is Bruce Wayne. Mr. Freeze wants what? Commissioner Gordon is on the other phone with Batman, Mr. Wayne. Perhaps if we put the two phones together, you could talk to him yourself. All right, chief. I don't have much time. Batman? Yes, Mr. Wayne. Have you heard Mr. Freeze's scurrilous demands? Just briefly. If Robin and I act as go-betweens are you prepared to make the telecast at midnight and pay the ransom, Mr. Wayne? I have no choice, Batman. I suggest you tape the broadcast from the commissioner's office an hour earlier and we will have a dummy package of money. A dummy package of money. That sounds risky. Risk is our business, Mr. Wayne. Of course, Batman, I have the same faith in you that all of Gotham City has. I hope Robin and I are deserving of that faith. I'll make the arrangements and meet you at the commissioner's office at 11. Fine. - Did you get all that, commissioner? -Indeed I did, Batman. We'll set up the taped telecast and have the dummy package of money waiting. See you at 11 tonight. Two fine men, so dissimilar in many respects, and yet Yet so similar in others. NARRATOR". And presently backstage at the Ice Arena, in the dressing room of Glacia Glaze nee, Emma Strunk I'm about to go on, darling. What's happening? Nothing will happen until midnight, Glacia. But if Wayne agrees to my terms and Batman and Robin deliver the money everything's in the ice bag. And do I have a chilling clincher for the Caped Crusaders. Oh, I'll bet you do. Have you frozen the professor's formula out of him? We're about to remove the professor from the Quick Freezer now. Hello, Glacia? Glacia? What happened to this thing? Mr. Wayne couldn't find the stage manager, Glacia. I offered to bring him and Mrs. Cooper to your room. Thank you, Carol. How nice to meet you both, but I'm afraid things are a little chaotic around here. Your whole day sounded chaotic, Ms. Glaze. Weren't you on the Gotham Queen? A ghastly experience, Mr. Wayne. I'd rather not talk about it. Of course. But how lovely you look. And such a pretty dressing room. Oh, my, what a darling compact. FREEZE". Glacia? Glacia, what happened? I was in the mid-- It talked. Again? What is wrong with this instrument? No, Mrs. Cooper, the compact didn't talk. It's a little music box I picked up in Switzerland. But now, if you'll excuse me, I must get out to the wings. This thing must be broken. Frosty, Chilblains? Remove the professor. He should be stone cold by now. - You're not even chilly. -I'm an lcelander, you frostbitten baboon. A slight drop in temperature makes little difference to me. Well, something will make a difference to you, professor. I'm going to get this formula out of you one way or the other. Down. Get me my dry ice injector. That's our cue, Carol. Thank you both for coming backstage. - And we certainly hope you enjoy the show. -Thank you, we will. Let's hurry to our box, Bruce. I don't wanna miss a minute. I have a call to make, Aunt Harriet. I'll join you shortly. Excuse me, Mr. Wayne. The telephone call you were expecting you can take in the foyer of your box. - Dick? -Yes, Bruce. I slipped an anti-eavesdrop Bat-plug into the telephone just in case. I suggest you do the same. I already have, and I've done what you said. Went down to the Batcave. Got the Remote Batmobile Control Phase Advanoer. Went up my Bat-pole, called a cab and I'm in a phone booth in the back of police headquarters right now. Good. Activate the Remote Control Phase Advanoer. Bring the Batmobile into town and have it parked in that alley. There's some red lockers outside of Commissioner Gordon's office. Put the Bat clothes in one of them. I'll meet you at 10:55. Alfred will take care of Aunt Harriet. Right. This is Bruce Wayne, Mr. Freeze. We've received your message. And Batman and Robin will make the delivery, when, where, how and if you so advise us. In return, we depend on you to keep your part of the bargain and release Professor lsaacson to the Caped Crusaders. Good evening. Thank you, gentlemen, for a difficult task well done. You sounded like an old pro, Mr. Wayne. An old pro, at paying a large ransom to that contemptible kidnapper? It's only dummy money, Mr. Wayne, as Batman suggested. Yes, I wonder why. I also wonder where he is. I've done my job and he told me himself he would be here. Well, he will, Mr. Wayne. No doubt about it. Probably delayed in traffic. You can always depend on the Caped Crusaders. Yes, I trust that's it. Dick, I think we should go now. You'll let us know what happens, gentlemen? Excuse us. He sounded rather unlike himself. So brisk and brief. Pressure, commissioner, gets us all. - Ah, here you are. -Good evening. Where's Mr. Wayne? He just left. Didn't you bump into him in the hall? - No. -Well, that's strange. Anyway, he pre-taped his telecast and here's the dummy money. Good. - Well, Robin, the Bat-ropes? -You bet. The Batmobile's in the rear alley. We'll save time. Aren't you gonna stay until Mr. Freeze hears the broadcast and advises us of the payoff site? I believe we already have a clue as to his whereabouts, commissioner. And the midnight broadcast may enable us to take him by surprise. Commissioner, when you called earlier you mentioned something about the ransom note being delivered by a seal. Right. He flipped right in here. Where is the seal? In a bathtub down the hall. Why, Batman? Take this. It's a small echoing seal pulsator. It may come in handy later. - What goes on around here? -Just be calm, citizen. I'm no citizen. I'm here from London for a manufacturers convention. - Then welcome, sir, to Gotham City. -You must be that gentleman I've read about. - Aren't you a king or something? -Robin, England has no king now. England has a Queen and a great lady she is too. Yes, that she is. But in a way, the lad is right. I am sometimes called the King, Carpet King, that is. - Holy floor covering. - Very apt, Robin. And speaking of floors, I think we should be dropping down a few more right now. Good evening, sir. We have second story men in England, but this is ridiculous. Frosty, Chilblains? Put the professor in the Quick Freezer. With his veins full of dry ice, something may happen. Ah, Glacia. The audience just wouldn't let me go, darling. My famous Waltzing arabesques were better than ever but I just had to be here with you at midnight to watch millionaire Bruce Wayne's broadcast. Just one minute to go. Let's warm this thing up. If you'll excuse the expression. This is Bruce Wayne, Mr. Freeze. We've received your message and Batman and Robin will make the delivery when, where, how and if you so advise us. - Are making the delivery and right now. -Switch it off. How could you have found us here? I have not yet called the Commissioner Gordon. Found you we have. Here's the money. - Phony. -As phony as you, Mr. Freeze? The gun. - Your Freeze Gun is useless. -Ha-ha-ha. Thanks to the super-thermalized Bat-skivvies we're wearing. Skivvies? Icemen, to the attack! Push them into the Quick Freezer with the professor. Better yet, toss them into the vaporizing transparent pipe pump. Ah, ha, ha! Follow me, icemen. Now, Glacia all I have to do is turn on the sub-zero temperature gauge. And when they've cooled down a little I will activate the vaporizing pipe pump and evaporate the caped double-crossers directly under the ice of the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena. Imagine, Glacia, being able to do your famous Waltzing arabesques directly on Batman and Robin. Behold, they are beginning to frost up already! 
NARRATOR". Morning at Gotham State Prison. And in the office of Warden Crichton, an old foe is saying his farewell. Oh, thank you, Warden Crichton, for all your kind words on my behalf. You've been on your best behavior for several months now, Joker. Mr. Wayne and I felt it should be rewarded. Yes, as chairman of the parole board, I've given your case a great deal of scrutiny. I'm convinced that you've mended your former ways. And so in keeping with our liberal penological practices we're releasing you considerably ahead of time. Oh, well, it isn't silk, but it's honestly made by my fellow inmates. I guess I'll have to get used to civilian clothes. Bare With this, uh, $10 bill. We hope you will seek a new life on the outside. One replete with good citizenship and fine deeds. Ten dollars. Mm. I used to light my cigars with $10 bills. Ha, ha. Oh, how about a cigar to celebrate the occasion? Well, I don't mind if I do. No, thank you. I never use tobacco in any form. Ha, ha. That's very good. Ha-ha-ha. You know, I sort of expected it to explode. Explode? Oh, you must have me confused with somebody else, warden. I'm a reformed man. Ha-ha-ha! Well, nice seeing you again. Toodle-oo. Ha-ha-ha! Well, I wonder who's picking him up for the drive back to Gotham City. Let's take a look. You want a lift, big boy? Make it look good, Catwoman. Pull a gun on me, the way we planned. They're probably watching us. Get in this car, or I'll blow whatever little brains you have out. She's kidnapping me. Honest. Kidnapped? By Catwoman? Well, he's barely out of prison. - I'd better call Commissioner Gordon. - I'll take care of that, warden. Get your men after them before they get too far away. Good idea. Stately Wayne Manor. Alfred, plug me into the Batphone and stand by. Consider it done, sir. I think I'd better take a rain check on that luncheon date. Mm-hm. Yes, commissioner. You're calling to tell me that Catwoman kidnapped Joker? I might have realized you'd be on top of the situation, Batman. Seems I'm always the last to know anything. We'll be right there. You leaving, Mr. Wayne? In light of the day's happenings, I'm gonna forgo my usual inspection of the prison. - Any luck? -Well, I've, uh, set up roadblocks at all the major highway points leading back to Gotham City. It's a slim chance, but our only hope. With Joker in the feline clutches of Catwoman who knows what all of us may be facing? NARRATOR". And at the Sleazy Hotel a sleazy hotel across the street from police headquarters Oh, thanks for my old suit, Catwoman. I felt out of place in this one. You looked out of place, Joker. But now you're back to your handsome self again. Yes. Ha-ha-ha. What are you doing? The telescopic lens on this Catgun affords me a fine and magnified view of Commissioner Gordon's office right across the street. -Oh! Oh, so it does, so it does. And unless my youthful eyes are deceiving me that looks like the Dynamic Dimwits in that office. You're going to kill them? I hope, I hope, I hope. No, Joker. Just going to send Batman the first of several little tokens of my affection. - The first? -Yes. He's as evilly clever as we. He'll no doubt figure out where my memento came from and will pay a call on this hotel room. - Oh, we better be gone. -We will. But I'll leave a second token of my devotion in our place. Yes, we have our work cut out for us, all right. I should say we do. Anytime two arch-criminals get together, Gotham City, and perhaps the world is in for enormous difficulty. But Catwoman kidnapped Joker. Maybe the fellow sincerely wants to go straight. Mother Machree, we're under attack. No, hold your fire, Chief O'Hara. We're not sure which direction that bullet came from. -Innocent people might be hurt. -Yes. It appears to be a message of some sort. Holy special delivery. "This one was just a warning, Batman. The next one will be between your eyelids" Any signature? "Signed, a well-wisher. " Well, it seems like somebody's interested in your welfare. You stay put. We'll Batcreep to the window. Somebody lose a contact lens? Get down, Barbara. It must have come from the Hotel Sleazy across the street. Judging from the trajectory and the angle and figuring the wind at six knots per hour, north by northeast as per this morning's weather report X times six squared, over Yes. You see, it came from that room on that floor. There doesn't seem to be anyone here. Are you sure this is the room? Positive. That's the suit Joker wore when he was released from prison. Mm. Mm-hm. Mm! No fingerprints. But judging from the familiar scent of Cat Lily perfume, which is Catwoman's trademark and that suit over there I would assume that they were both in this room not less than three minutes ago. Find anything? That scrap of paper. Nothing more. Batgirl, what are you doing here? Just thought I might be able to lend a glove, so to speak. You constantly amaze me. I can't figure out how you manage to stay on top of a caper as quickly as we do. Tea leaves, stars, crystal-gazing all part of a woman crime-fighter's arsenal, Batman. Any clues? Enough to tell us know we're dealing with both Catwoman and Joker. How can I help? Until we find something more tangible, you can't. Well, then it's hello and goodbye. At least for now. At least for now. That scrap of paper, Batman, it's gone. Yes, Batgirl slipped it into her belt when she thought I wasn't looking. - You think she's trying to double-cross us? -No, but she's a woman, Robin with a woman's inborn desire to outsmart men. Tea leaves, crystal-gazing, stars. I wonder what she'll come up with next. Whoa. Woo, ha-ha-ha! - You like it, Joker? -it's me. It's like I never left home. Oh, you certainly have an eye for decoration. Now it's time to meet my cat's paws. Front and center, henchmen. This is Giggler. Oh, it's sure gonna be nice working with you, Joker. Heh, heh. Oh, ha-ha-ha, yes. - This is Laugher. -Ha-ha-ha! I've always wanted to work with you, Joker. It's the realization of my boyhood dream. Well, thanks, fellas. Keep smiling. They're good men, Joker. Perfect aides-de-camp for our evil crime spree, don't you think? Oh, perfect, Catwoman. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, and speaking of evil crime sprees Shall I catalog it for you, Joker? - Categorically, Catwoman. -Ha, ha. Then cast your eyes on this. - A poem? -Yes. Handwritten over 200 years ago during the French and Indian War. I purloined it from the library. It was written by Gargon Maltese, the famous crook and it's a clue to 1 million pounds of gunpowder he stole and hid someplace in the environs of Gotham City. Oh, now you're talking. One million of anything is a lot. We're going to find that gunpowder and blow a hole in the federal depository building you can drive a truck through. Then drive a truck through and loot the place. Oh, why don't we just heist a bunch of dynamite? Far too simple, Joker. And not half as much fun as being devilishly clever. - Oh. -After all, we're not common thieves. - No. Ha-ha-ha. -Listen. Gunpowder is what you shall find Should you have a most logical mind In riches you'll wallow If you carefully follow The clues I have herein consigned His iambic pentameter is a bit off. - What he should have said was-- -Now, listen. My old nightshirt will do for a start In its hem is a clue that's a chart Then from there find my crib On its side is a fib And my powder is yours, if you're smart Oh, your voice has a nice lilt, Catwoman. But just what does all that mean? I've located the nightshirt and the crib. Now our next move is to purloin and if possible permanently purge Batman, Batgirl and Robin, the Boy Wonder. Do they know about that poem? If they don't, they should. Shortly. The missing corner of this parchment was intentionally left in that fleabag of a hotel room. Ha, ha. Meanwhile back in her guise as Barbara Gordon, the mild-mannered librarian The document she wants is missing but the Gotham City Library makes microcopies of everything. - I'll take it, Alfred. - Right, sir. - Yes, commissioner? -Batman, this is Batgirl. Batgirl on Commissioner Gordon's red phone? Just as there are secrets in crime-fighting so should every crime-fighter be allowed his -or her secret. - Agreed. I've come up on something that may help in your search for Catwoman and Joker. Crystal-gazing again, Batgirl? This time I used cards. Meet me immediately at the apartment of Little Louie Groovy 27 Disc Drive. -Little Louie Groovy the teenage tycoon who's never missed producing a million-seller record? - Gosh, Bruce, I've always wanted to meet him. -We'll be right there. To the Batpoles. NARRATOR". Shortly, in the groovy pad of Little Louie the young tycoon of the recording business Who you recording tonight? You never tell me anything anymore. A new group I just discovered about 20 minutes ago. Called the Gotham Boulevard Off-Ramp. They'll have the number one record in the country a week from Tuesday. Look, I gotta make my money fast. Another couple of years, I'll be in my mid-20s. Too old for the music business, over the hill. Heh. It's no wonder I'm insecure. - Okay, split. -Ooh. Ooh! What a client I got. Little Louie, you've just slipped the groove. Who's that? Look, if you're here to rob me, I ought to warn you that I'm a karate expert and I can hurt you. So stay back. Hyah! Karate isn't effective unless accompanied by yelling. Let him howl until he sprains a vocal chord, then get him. I can't yell anymore. I'm done for. All right, boys. Now. Hoo,hoo! Oh, I have to give you credit, Catwoman. I expected this place to be a shambles because of a fight. As it may yet be, Joker. So, Batman, you found us. As you perhaps planned, Catwoman. The mere thought of pulling a caper without your masked meddling would be most perturbing to me. Found us you have, and get you we will. Get them, boys. My first royalty check. No, no, that's $4000. Please, don't. Oh, no, no. Please, please. You guys ruined my apartment. It'll cost over $11,000 to replace all the goodies. Never fear, Mr. Groovy, full restitution will be made. Even if it takes Catwoman and Joker the rest of their natural lives to pay it off. I can't understand why you went to all that trouble to steal a nightshirt. He doesn't know about the gunpowder. - Give him a catchy story. -Oh Well, it was all Catwoman's fault, fellas. If you recall, it was she who kidnapped me. You cat fink. She told me that Louie Groovy was a hip oat and that it might be fun if we stole the cat's pajamas. Well, you know how I am about practical jokes. I couldn't resist it. You must have flipped your raspberry, Joker. How could you allow anyone to talk you into something stupid? Agreed. You're absolutely and positively right. Oh, I made a dreadful mistake. Oh, let bygones be bygones. I'd like to shake hands with both of you. Can't we be friends? I'd rather shake hands with a spitting cobra. You're being cynical, Robin. "To err is human, to forgive divine. " Perhaps he has repented. I think the poor fellow should have a fighting chance. I'll shake your hand, Joker. Oh, okay, I'll shake your hand too. - Another practical joke, Joker? - Not exactly, Batman. No, it's my lethal Joker-buzzer. One by one, your five senses will leave you then your lungs will collapse, and shortly you'll be kaput, finis, defunct. Ha-ha-ha. Sorry we can't stay for the big finish, Batman but I'll always treasure the memory of this moment. Let's go. Three beats a minute, not too good. What took you so long, Batgirl? Rush hour traffic. Plus all the lights were against me. You wouldn't want me to speed, would you? Your good driving habits almost cost us our lives. Rules are rules, Robin. But you do have a point. How did you know that Catwoman and Joker would be here? It's all written in a poem they have in their possession. The nightshirt they stole and cradle are clues to an enormous cache of gunpowder. - Where is the cradle? -In the possession of Karnaby Katz devil-may-care men's clothing designer from Londinium. Here, drink this. Water? Champagne. Over here. Oh, my head. - We're too late. -What happened, Mr. Katz? The 17-year locusts have descended upon me, governor. But they didn't touch the safe or my wife's jewels or my collection of comic books or anything valuable like that. All they took was a little cradle that I picked up at an antique store. Why do you suppose they did that? That is the question. How long ago did they leave? Seconds before you walked in. I thought you might have met them on their way out. Do you have any idea where the gunpowder might be, Batgirl or why they might it? The poem would've led us to the clues, and without the clues, we're lost. We can just wait and see what their next move is. Where could they have disappeared to so quickly? NARRATOR". Closer than you think. Just outside waiting to ambush you. Will Joker and Catwoman make good their perfidious plan to steal millions? For the answer to these and other cataclysmic questions watch the next episode. 
NARRATOR". Nothing has changed with the weather in the great metropolis of Londinium. It's still clear as glass. But at least the Dynamic Duo are out of the fog in the winch room. And the mist seems to have missed the Batmobile. Thank heavens, Robin. I despaired of ever seeing you again. The despair was mutual, Alfred. I think we better get out to Ffogg Place and see what's happened to Batgirl. - Batgirl? -Yes. Alfred heard that she discovered a super-secret Cricket Pavilion which just might contain the solution to this entire mystery. She has and it does. You two seem to know a lot more about Batgirl than I do. She's in the dungeon at Ffogg Place beneath the gallery off the super-secret Cricket Pavilion. I would be too if Lord Ffogg hadn't wanted me to wind up in the winch room. - We better get there on the double. -If I may, sir, my cab. - Your cab? -I borrowed one from my cousin Cuthbert to get around a bit, you know? It's parked in the dock area. Yes, of course, I remember. Better still, Robin, you drive the Batmobile. Let us off at Alfred's cab, go straight to Ffogg Place, and we'll follow. You bet, Batman. If we disassemble, maybe we can catch the whole gang off guard. And don't forget to drive on the left, not the right. I won't, Batman. I learned that when we got our international driver's licenses. Good. Batman. NARRATOR". Meanwhile in the dungeon at Ffogg Place Batgirl seems to have survived Lord Ffogg's paralyzing gas. But what next? So young, so pretty, such joie de vivre. Yes, Marmaduke. It seems a pity that we have to dispose of her, doesn't it? But dispose of her we must. With Batman and Robin fogbound in the Tower Bridge we can now plan our crowning theft. - The Crown Jewels. -The Crown Jewels? - She heard you, Marmaduke. -It matters little, sister dear. Somehow Batman has managed to regain his memory. But death will prevent Batgirl from regaining hers when I toss these lethal fog pellets from the steps. - Toodle-oo. -And chin-chin. NARRATOR". And soon, hard by the gates of Ffogg Place What's that? The blooming Boy Wonder climbed over the main gates? Hold your places. I'll handle this. Did you hear that, Penelope? Robin is on the grounds someplace. We must act covertly to trap him. Well, why don't we have Lady Prudence act covertly? Lady Prudence. Splendid, my dear, splendid. Smashing, Robin. You've tripped the wire leading to His Lordship's beehive. And released an African death bee. The queen, in fact. She's landing on your hand, Robin. Don't lose your cool. Tempted, sir? Sorely, Alfred. By opening this suitcase, I might learn Batgirl's true identity. And thus destroy the anonymity so precious to her. As yours is to you, sir. I know, Alfred. You go back to the city while I infiltrate Ffogg Place and try to find her and Robin. Alert Commissioner Gordon and venerable Ireland Yard as to my whereabouts. Tell them I'll be in touch if I need help. Cheerio. She won't leave. She may. But once a death bee lands, she usually stays a while. Or she may sting you, Robin, and you'll die. All the other girls are out of their skin over you. I can see why, Robin. I can see why. What? Not dead yet? No, Lord Ffogg, far from it. My lethal fog pellets must be stale. They're losing their strength. Well, I had the girls make up a fresh batch in chemistry class, Marmaduke. And I hid them amongst the Duchess of Desborough's diamonds to be handy. Let's get them. But, Marmaduke, hadn't we better hurry? What with Robin out on the lawn and Batman coming up the drive. When the death bee stings Boy Wonder, he'll be out the lawn forever. Then Digby, Scudder and Basil can handle Batman. Well, they didn't before. Since that little incident, I've given them a severe talking to. What? Batman got away from the terrace? He's coming here to the Cricket Pavilion? Basil, you are discharged. We had better hurry, Penelope. - Unh. - Come here, Penelope. - Batgirl. -No, Batman, don't come down here. Look out behind you. Lord Ffogg. Quick, the pellets, my dear. I will close and bolt the door to the dungeon. What a triumph. A double triumph. And the grooviest thing happened, governor. What happened? - The bee stung Robin. -Ah! Well, you better take him up to the girls' dormitory and let him perish there. And round up the rest of the pupils. We're off to the Tower of Londinium and the Crown Jewels. Why don't I perish here? It's closer. NARRATOR". Courage, Robin. Seconds away, Alfred is forcing the gates of Ffogg Place with an unusual show of strength. What's this? Another troubled visitor in venerable Ireland Yard? I'm sorry to bother you here in venerable Ireland Yard, commissioner. Oh, no bother, Mrs. Cooper. I'm glad you found me. I'm sure Bruce and Dick are someplace in Londinium but I haven't been able to locate them. I'm on my way home from my North Cape cruise and I hoped to surprise them. Well, Bruce has been tied up on Wayne Foundation business since his arrival and young Mr. Dick, I believe, is doing some research at the various museums. And we have various, various museums, Mrs. Cooper. - Ha-ha-ha. -Yes, ha, ha. Well, I thank you both for your time. It's been a pleasure. - Oh, commissioner. -Yes, ma'am? If you hear from either of them will you please tell them that I'll be at the Londinium House for another day or so? -Of course. It's nice meeting you. Oh, the pleasure's been all mine. - Thank you again. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Ha, ha. Yeah, delightful lady. NARRATOR". While back in the dungeon That Anti-Lethal-Fog Batspray is working, Batman. Yes, I always carry some in my utility belt along with a Bat-file. Now to get to work on those chains. NARRATOR". As in the pretty student bodies' dormitory You're not dying, Robin. I was down to my last African death bee antidote pill but I popped it in my mouth and I'm fine. - Groovy. -You're right, Duchess. Man, I'm ape about you, Robin. Oh, you're duping my mind. I'm launched. Were you ape and launched when you waylaid me on that dock shanghaied me and brought me back here when you knew I was being tied to a winch in Tower Bridge? Merely scholastic exercises, Boy Wonder. Holy homework. I'm getting out of here. Your daughter, commissioner? No, she's not here. She left earlier this afternoon. Left? For where? I don't know. We were out. That's very unlike Barbara, not getting in touch with me. I'm coming over there at once. Oh, certainly, commissioner. He's coming out here at once, Marmaduke. At once? With Londinium traffic the way it is in the late afternoon it will be an hour at least. I don't see why the girls are not-- It was your idea, my sweet. Yes, but that was before we decided to fog in on the Crown Jewels. Tell the girls to bury Robin where the aftergrass lawn is thickest. No one will ever find Batman and Batgirl in that dungeon and we're home free as soon as we get the Crown Jewels. I have a strange feeling that the authorities are beginning to get suspicious of us, Marmaduke. Getting suspicious of us is one thing, getting us is another. Our private plane is being refueled right now. And Argentuela has no extradition treaty with this country. Argentuela. Oh, Marmaduke, I've always wanted to go to the Southern Hemisphere. I'll alert the household staff. - You sacked the household staff. -I rehired them. They're doctoring their bruises. - What is it, Lady Prudence? -Robin got away, governor. He jumped out of the window of the girls' dormitory. - Dead? -Dead? He wasn't dead. He's took some sort of bee-sting pill. Isn't that the most? To the Tower of Londinium at once. Just as I suspected, the dungeon door is made of solid oak. I can't break through it. If we could only reach that grating up there. Your Batarang? I left it in the Batmobile. If we only had a length of rope. Here's some rope, Batman. But how can you get it to the grating without your Batarang? By using the old Indian rope trick. I mastered it years ago. How can I help? By standing directly under that grating and concentrating on the Indian fakir command. Hindi for "rope stay straight. " Master Robin, I just heard you were dead. You heard wrong. Uh, wrongly. I gotta get a message to Commissioner Gordon at venerable Ireland Yard. Just what I was attempting to do. Lord Ffogg is planning to steal the Crown Jewels from the Tower of Londinium. And Batman and Batgirl are both in the Ffogg Place dungeon. I'll get back there. You get on the Batmobile's Batphone. Good. NARRATOR". But Lord Ffogg and his evil entourage of Londinium ladies are already on their way to the Tower of Londinium and the Crown Jewels. It worked. Yes, there's more to old Indian fakir tricks than one might suspect. And concentration magnified by the power of yoga? Yes, yes, that's enough talking, Batgirl. Up you go. This rope may have saved our lives. Batman, Batgirl, how did you get out of that dungeon? Holy levitation. - The rope's doing it again. -Yes, I better reverse the incantation. Can you conjure up something to get us to the tower before Lord Ffogg and Lady Peasoup? They've left to steal the Crown Jewels. I certainly hope so, Robin. And so at the famed Tower of Londinium. . . otherwise known as the Bloody Tower where two Beefeaters and a busbied sentry guard the glass case containing the Crown Jewels. A, ha! Here we are, girls, the Crown Jewels. Aren't they magnificent? Look at the Star of Africa diamond in the royal scepter. Isn't it smashing? Well, I'm out of my skin over the Sovereign's Golden Orb. I'm sorry, but it's past closing. Past closing? To me, Lord Ffogg of Ffoggshire? I'll take that halberd. But not the Crown Jewels, Lord Ffogg. Batman and Robin? How did you get here? It took a holy incantation. Basil, Digby, Scudder! - Oh, we're here, governor. -Johnny-on-the-spot. Jolly good timing, what. Hey- I think we better split, Lady Peasoup. Indeed, Prudence. Batgirl. "Batgirl? "Batgirl? My Pipe of Fog Bat-reverser, Your Lordship. You'll not catch us flat-footed again. Well, this is a jolly little beanfest. Take His Lordship, Her Ladyship and these girlships to the tombs. But who's going to look after our aftergrass, Marmaduke? Quite so, quite so. I wish I had time to explain, Robin. I've been very naughty. I thought if I could play all sides against each other, I would come out on top and be Her Ladyship of Ffogg Place alone. But it didn't work. No, Lady Prudence, it didn't. But cheerio. Well, I think this calls for a cup of char at venerable Ireland Yard. Char? Yes, Robin, a colloquialism for tea. I think a cup of char would be most welcome, sir. It will be our first in Londinium, as a matter of fact. Will you join us, Batgirl? Hm. She's gone. Batgirl? I just passed her outside in the fog. She was on her Batgirl Cycle. Where have you been? I've been so worried. And what are you doing in this Bloody Tower? Bloody Tower is right, Daddy. I'll explain later, or at least I'll try to. But look, the Crown Jewels. Right where they belong, my dear. Thanks to Batman and Robin. Pip-pip, chin-chin and toodle-oo. Yes, sir, we all know how important international relations are and I'm glad we were able to help in our small way. Uh, how's your grandson? Heh. He is? Extraordinary. Ha-ha-ha. He is? Incredible. He is? Amazing. One second, sir. He's right here. This is Batman, sir. A weekend in Texas, sir? With a barbecue, sir? And bring the Batmobile, sir? That's a great honor, sir, but, uh I wonder, could Robin and I take a rain check, sir sometime around Easter? Oh, of course, sir. I'm sorry, I completely forgot. Yes, that's convention time. Mm-hm. But thank you for calling, sir. How could you turn down an invitation like that, Batman? Oh, I'm sure he has plenty of problems right now without trying to entertain average citizens such as Robin and I. No, we'll just hole up here in Gotham City. Yes, Bonnie. I'm sorry to bother you, commissioner but some very feline character just breezed in here. Hold it, Bonnie. Say that again, will you, please? Some very feline character just breezed in here and stole all the policewomen 's new mini-uniforms you were to approve. Some feline character? Could it be Catwoman back again? Let's take a look. The Caped Crusaders will try to head her off, Bonnie. Just one minute, Catwoman. The nerve of her, invading police headquarters. Yes, Robin. Gotham City may be in for some cataclysmic catastrophes. NARRATOR". And how right Batman is. How catastrophic are the days and nights to come as you will see in the next episode. 
NARRATOR". A beastly hot day in Gotham City. Rare indeed for a metropolis which generally enjoys perfect weather. But what better time of year for Gotham City's Annual Miss Galaxy contest for which the five remaining contestants are already preparing this morning for tonight's final event. And five beauties they are, indeed. Miss Corsica, Miss Canary Islands Miss Barrier Reef the local favorite, Miss Gotham City herself and Miss Iceland. But what's this? Strangers are never allowed in the beauty queen's dressing room let alone kidnappers. Let alone him. Sorry I can't take you all with me. Ladies. Oh-ho! What a scorcher. Ninety-six in the shade and the temperature's still rising. Miss Iceland? Kidnapped from the beauty pageant dressing room? The leader was wearing what? A collar with jet nozzles? To keep his head cold? Of course. At once. Jet nozzles to keep your head cold? Sounds like a good invention. But there's just one man who might have invented it, Chief O'Hara. Just one man who can live in an environment And just one man who is likely to have kidnapped Miss Iceland. Shiver me timbers, commissioner. - You don't mean Mr. Freeze? -I do, indeed. That cold-blooded, cold-hearted, calloused culprit. Seems a pity on a day like this to call out the Caped Crusader. Fair weather or foul, dog days or a monsoon who else could we call in such a crisis? - And who else would answer? -Mm. Maybe he'll welcome the air conditioning-- Commissioner. I wonder if Batman will welcome the air conditioning. Wild. Help! Frozen tight. What do we do? NARRATOR". And in Wayne Manor stately home of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson - Uh, help. - Naturally, sir. Oh, Alfred. Mrs. Cooper was looking for you. Something about that reception she's planning tonight. Thank you, Alfred. - Yes, commissioner. -Bat Help- The commissioner. I think he was trying to tell me something. To the Batpoles. On the double. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in an ice cream truck directly across the street the sinister Mr. Freeze is plotting his next cold, calculating move. So the Caped Crusaders have come to the rescue after all. That means the newspaper reporters won't be far behind. Wild. Chill? - You have the iceman? -He's waiting outside, Mr. Freeze. Shivers, you have the ice? It's all ready, boss. - Get the operation going. -Okay, boss. Holy polar front. Yes, Boy Wonder. The commissioner and Chief O'Hara are trapped in that office. With frost and snow and slush and ice pouring out all over. It's terrible. I'm afraid they died an icy death by now. A negative viewpoint, sergeant. A man has nothing without hope. Robin, the plastic explosive. Stand clear, please. Darling, Miss Iceland. Soon I'll be able to make you much more comfortable. Then I'll start lowering the temperature in your lovely body and you will learn how to love me. To love me as much as most people will learn how to hate Batman. No matter how thick the battle no matter how heavy the frost no matter who you really are or where you ever come from I knew I could depend on you, Batman. But why can't we find out what happened? Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara nearly freeze to death in this office on the hottest day of the year, and nobody can or will give us any details whatsoever. - Yeah. - Please. Please, gentlemen of the press and this attractive young lady. Nellie Majors. Gotham City Herald. As if you didn't know. I ask you all to be patient. Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara will give you the details later. As you can see, it's been a rather harrowing experience. That's what our readers buy, Batman. Harrowing experiences. Has this anything to do with the kidnapping of Miss Iceland today? Miss Iceland kidnapped? Holy hijack. And might it involve a certain arch criminal who escaped from the state penitentiary last week in an ice cream truck? It just might, Nellie. Yes, it's very possible Mr. Freeze has started another cold wave of terror. Robin, since when do we make public accusations without strong solid proof? Robin's indiscreet statement is strictly off the record. Not off my record, Batman. I'm sorry, Ms. Majors I certainly wasn't suggesting what your paper should or should not print. It's just that I feel-- That you're on a spot, Batman? Is that it? Oh, I know you're a well-known crime-fighter and a local hero. But I've seen many heroes tarnished in the course of my career. Nellie, I won't have the Caped Crusader spoken to like that in this office. You too, commissioner? Something to hide? Where did you come from? Who ordered that? A couple of guys down on the street sent it up. Paid off in advance. Nice present on a day like this. "To Batman. For incidental crime expenses. " I-C-E. Ice? Ice. Green ice. Bribe money, Batman? A reward for not revealing what happened here today? Afraid I don't understand, Ms. Majors. I doubt if the readers of the Gotham City Herald will be equally deluded. Your mask seems to make an excellent blindfold. Come on, fellas. Regardless of how this little windfall is interpreted, I'd still like to see it go to the Policemen's Welfare Fund, commissioner. After the way you've been vilified today? It's not your fault, commissioner, and I certainly don't blame Ms. Majors. A reporter's lot is not easy. Making exciting stories out of plain, average, everyday people like Robin and me. NARRATOR". In a seemingly abandoned cold storage plant Mr. Freeze has taken up temporary residence where even now he is coldly calculating his next move in Operation Hate Batman. Wild, boys. Wild. Look here. "ls Batman being bribed? Is Batman on ice? What slippery character is putting the skids under the Caped Crusader?" Written by someone called Nellie Majors. Very good article too. Must be a very clever woman, that Nellie Majors. - Don't you think so, boys? -Sure do, boss. She's the smartest news hand on the Gotham City Herald, Mr. Freeze. Wild. Now, put on your costumes for the next maneuver. Well, the Cape Crusader is getting the works at last. Now he'll understand what it is like not to be loved. Now he'll feel hate for once. Hate. Like I feel hate. You should feel hate. I certainly hate you. But why, my darling Miss Iceland? Haven't I made you comfortable? All this beautiful furniture, those nice cool frosty bars to lower the temperature in your beautiful body? To air condition you, darling, so you would stop hating me? Once you hit 50-degree below zero, you will be loving me. Loving you? Oh, you're a monster. Never. Oh, we'll see. - We'll see. -Oh! You will see, Mr. Freeze. Wasn't there something in those newspapers about my kidnapping? A small item or two. But all the important headlines were taken up by Batman's disgrace. Do my eyes deceive me or is this the Dynamic Duo? We put on the costume like you said, Mr. Freeze. - I'm Batman. -I'm Robin. Wild. From a distance, even I couldn't tell the difference. Now, this is my plan. We've fed the Batanalyzer all the pertinent information on Mr. Freeze's past crimes. Now, let's see what it computes for the future. What is it, Batman? It's more green ice. - Yes, Alfred? -Knowing first things come first, sir I waited until the last possible moment before interrupting your computations but, uh, the guests will be arriving shortly. - Guests? -Yes, sir. The poolside reception this evening. For the Bruce Wayne Foundation. Holy tuxedo. If we're late, Aunt Harriett will kill us. "Kill" is not a word to be bandied about haphazardly, Robin. Angry, yes, as well she might be if we're late. Don't forget, we placed the entire burden of this reception on her stout, unselfish shoulders. On the double. Good evening, Mayor Linseed. And Linda. How nice to have you. It's so nice to be here, Mrs. Cooper. Any party at stately Wayne Manor is a big event in our lives. - Thank you. -My dear. What could have happened to Bruce and Dick? He'll be here in a moment, madam. Oh, here they are now. - Sorry, Aunt Harriett, a slight delay. -I lost a cuff link. Well, I think everyone's here. Alfred, ask the caterer to start passing the hors d'oeuvres. They already are, madam. But I'll check again below stairs. Beautiful, Aunt Harriett. You've outdone yourself, as usual. You really like it? I originally planned to have it all Japanese-y but the caterer called and suggested Irish. He said green was most becoming to women guests. What do you think? - Green? -I even had the reflection pool dyed green. - Mrs. Cooper is a clever colleen, Bruce. -Yes. Who would have thought it? A wee bit of the Emerald Isle right outside of Gotham City. Heh-heh. Holy shamrocks. Emerald. Also known among the criminal set as green ice. -Green ice. Stop. Don't move, anybody. Nobody move. What in the world is this? Let's get him quick. Patience, Dick Grayson. You've all heard me. So no monkey business. Who is he? How dare he come here and spoil our nice party. Maybe that special duty policeman-- Bruce, we just can't stand here. These are my guests, Dick. I don't dare make a move to put them in further jeopardy. Waiters. Clear your trays and fill them up with real goodies. Wild. Ha-ha-ha! That voice. It sounds exactly like the caterer who called suggesting the Irish motif. -Figures. I'll try sneaking around him. No, Chief O'Hara. Better the loss of a few baubles than the life of a stalwart citizen. No, no. Not that. No. It's engraved. A generous memento, given to me by the good people of Gotham City. - You can't do that. - Don't fight it, Aunt Harriet. One day, these men will get their just desserts. - Oh! -You said it, Aunt Harriett. Enough amusement for now. And so you don't do anything foolish like following us everybody into the pool, please. Bruce. This is too much. Do something. Under the circumstances I think it would be wise to follow his instructions. When I say in the pool, I mean in the pool. Move, please. I have never felt so indignant. Or so helpless. That'll cool you off a little. Wild. Ha-ha-ha! - Green ice. -Just as the computer predicted. If only Batman and Robin were here. Sure, and our only chance for salvation are the Caped Crusaders. They must have heard us. All right, Mr. Freeze. Give back those jewels or else. Or what else? You'll be sorry. That's wild. Ha-ha-ha! Easy, Batman. You almost hit me. Oh, sorry, Mr. Freeze. I'll be more careful next time. Batman and Robin, don't leave us. No, the safety of the guests here comes first. - How do I look with egg on my face? - Shh, shh. Wild. Ha-ha-ha! Strange, the Dynamic Duo acting in this manner. It's not like them. Not like them at all. It is not. Though everyone has heard the recent rumor. That's, 'fi they read the Gotham City Herald. Merciful heavens. Your arrival was well-timed, Alfred. If you hadn't turned on that pool heater, we'd all still be frozen in. A clever ploy by Mr. Freeze, I'm afraid. - That inhuman ice cube. -If I'd arrived even earlier, sir I might have been able to expose those impostors of his. Um, if I may say so, sir. I'm a bit concerned about the current reputation of the Caped Crusaders. - Me too. -There are other reputations to be considered. Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara, Mayor Linseed. None of this looks good for Gotham City. But Alfred's right, Batman. Everyone will believe that story about you taking a bribe. Unless we capture Mr. Freeze and return the jewels tonight. And perhaps rescue Miss Iceland. Her kidnapping seems to have become secondary. A regrettable situation for any young girl. I hear Iceland is considering severing diplomatic relations, sir. Which we must prevent at all cost. But where could he be hiding out? Yes. Three good possibilities. "The Bottling Works, the Meat Packing Company and the Frosty Freezies Factory. " Currently shut down but adjoining the cold storage plant. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful for my beautiful love. I want nothing from you. Ever. Perhaps you're not cool enough to be cooperative. I'm colder than I want to be. - My fingers are getting numb. -That's good. Your metabolism is changing and your temperature is still a bit above zero. In the morning, you'll be 50 below. And madly in love with me. You could turn me into a glacier and I still wouldn't love you. You a glacier, darling Miss Iceland? Never. But I have other plans for a monstrous ice floe. What is it, Chill? Here's the frozen reindeer meat you wanted for a midnight snack. Oh. What else? Something seems to be bothering you. I was leaving the Meat Packing Company, the Batmobile pulled up. Oh, so the Cape Crusaders are now checking cold storage units. And getting closer. Now the Batmobile is parked in front of the Frosty Freezies Factory. Batman and Robin must be inside. Wild. We will put the Dynamic Duo on ice once and forever. Gosh, Batman. Dig those flavors. "Lemon lime, orange, raspberry, pineapple. " Take your choice, Boy Wonder. Haven't you read the newspapers? Haven't you heard the stories? The public is fickle. You're no longer the great hero of Gotham City. And soon, very soon, you'll be hated. Despised like me. Wild. Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Wild. Look out, Robin. The freeze gun. So you wanted to outsmart me, eh? But you can't outsmart the machinery in this factory. And soon you'll be the first two human frosty freezies in history. Ha-ha-ha! Wild. 
Batman So far we have seen a peaceful matinee at a fashionable theater. Stick 'em up! Holy bombshell! The crook caught by the Penguin. The loot restored and a beautiful rich admirer found. Can it be? That waddling master of foul play gone straight? Grill that crook. Make him admit he's a Penguin stooge. Useless. The bird won't sing. In the steam room of the Millionaire's Club an attempted kidnap. Again foiled by The Penguin and his magic umbrella. The Penguin set up in business, rival to the dynamic duo. Alfred, the butler, an undercover agent. . caught in the act. A desperate escape. The Penguin must be after those priceless jewels. Bait for a clever Penguin trap. But Penguin's too clever. Holy backfire! What a catastrophe! Snap goes The Penguin trap. Cement filled umbrellas. Strung up behind a shooting gallery. Death at the unwitting hands of the police. Wait. The wildest is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman 'Now, gentlemen' 'at my instructions. ' 'Ready?' 'Aim. ' Fire! What's so funny, Penguin? Oh, the irony of it. - The exquisite humor. - Where's our check? The 1000 bucks for the police benevolent fund. Yes, with my gratitude, you've earned it. It's certified. Holy Hot Foot! The bulletproof soles of our shoes sure saved our lives. The shock has luckily unjammed my Bat-knife too. I'll cut these ropes. We'll get out of here fast. Unh! You know, it's quite a recoil for a pop gun. You're right, Chief O'Hara. I noticed that myself. Hmm. Now, let's toss the costume corpses over the pier. To the sharks with them. Great blubbering whale oil! They've evaporated! Slugged me when I wasn't lookin'. Batarangs! Curses! Curses! Now, we'll have to fight another round. Gosh, Batman! I still think we should've crashed in and caged that bird. On what charge? Attempted murder. Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara fired the guns. Ouch. Yes. We're the fugitives. We are wanted by the law for burglary. Besides, The Penguin had legally rented that amusement pier. - We are the trespassers. - Holy Nightmare! In this game, Penguin holds all the aces. He may be holding all the aces but tomorrow morning we play the trump card. Those masked menaces must be apprehended. I won't stand for it. A civil tongue, Penguin or I'll have you removed from my office. A civil tongue, is it? You watch out! I'll have you removed from your office. What? My influential friends won't like this. They'll have you thrown back into the department of sanitation where you belong for harboring wanted criminals. An outrageous accusation. Open your yap, Penguin. Make that charge again. I'm afraid, Penguin's right. My dear Miss Starr! Do you pretend you can't find these criminals, commissioner? What's the matter, commissioner? Your famous hotline out of order? Penguin, don't touch that phone! - Yes, commissioner. - Quack, quack! I'm on the track. - Penguin! - No answer, eh? Hmm? The heat is on, Batman. You'd better come in. And give yourself up on that burglary charge. Instantly. Do you understand? I'll see you, Penguin. I'll be at your Protective Agency Office in 25 minutes. Did you hear that? He's on his way to attack me. I demand protection. Penguin is within his rights, Chief O'Hara. Stake out the area. Arrest Batman. Yes, sir. Get on the mobile Bat-phone. Call Commissioner Gordon. Roger. Give him the following instructions. Come on, my fine frosty finks. Batman's on his way. Rargh! Well, the costumed crooks! The dressed-up desperadoes! Your super brain power has driven us mad, Penguin! Something snapped! 'We don't care if we go up the river for a hundred years. ' - 'We're getting you first!!' - Quick, my finks! Self-defense! The dynamic duo has flipped their wigs! Batman, listen! The police! Let's get out of here. Surrender, Batman! We're taking you in. Get 'em, coppers! Oh, frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! Let's bag the Batmobile. Sensational idea! Come on! Let's see now. How do you run this dratted thing? I'll call the morgue. Don't feel too sad, boys. You had to do it. There's nothin' so tragic as a good crime fighter turned bad. In view of their past services, I've given orders that they be buried with full police honors. Despite the fact they died as fugitive felons? Yes, George, despite that fact. Nothing can erase the memory of the deeds they performed before theybecame unhinged. 'Tell me, commissioner' 'what do you think brought about this?' Batman and Robin dead? What in the world is going to become of us? Perhaps that's a better question than you realize, madam. How I wish Bruce and Dick were here. Maybe they could console me. I doubt that very much, Mrs. Cooper. I doubt it very much. - Thank you, commissioner. - Any time, George. - Hello, chief. - George. Uh, for your signature, commissioner. - Oh. - Yeah. It's a requisition slip for the ammo we used getting Batman and Robin on the big gunfight. Two hundred and ninety seven rounds including Tommy gun and pistol. - Strange, isn't it? - Isn't what strange? Two hundred and ninety seven rounds of blank ammunition. You know them blanks cost more than the real ones? Ah! Oh, what a thrill, Pengy darling. Driving in your Birdmobile through Gotham City on an anti-crime patrol. Birdmobile? What nerve? By whatever name that tiny TV transmitter we built at back of the fuel gauge is functioning perfectly. I just hope some foolish felon tries to start-- Look! Isn't that a holdup? Handover that payroll or get ventilated. Pengy, it is a holdup. Was a holdup up you mean. Oh, Pengy, you routed him. Oh, what a crime fighter. What a man of action. Holy mush! I bet your milkshake that so-called holdup Penguin just foiled was another charade. Gosh, Batman, I think it's time we came back from the grave and nail that brassy bird! Patience, Robin. Our seeming demise is our trump card. That and letting him steal the Batmobile. I'd sure like to try some of the special gimmicks we installed. Don't worry, Robin. We'll have time. Just as soon as The Penguin reveals his plot. I know it has something to do with Sophia Starr. Sweet Sophia. Darling Pengy birdie. Holy Romeo and Juliet! Sophialook into my eyes. Will you? Will you? Will you? Oh, yes, Penguin. Yes, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. - Solid gold dinner sets. - Check. Diamond studded electric can opener. Check. - Oil well. - Check. Oil well? The deeds in the envelope, stupid. From the bride's uncle in Texas. Wow! The guests have come. - Everything set? - Yeah. The bomb we placed in the water pipes ought to go off right. . Perfect, eh? Good gracious! What happened? Oh, nothing to bother you, my little love. One of those dratted water pipes seems to have burst. Luckily, we brought some water buckets and umbrellas too. Enough for small list of distinguished guests. Oh, you are fantastic, Penguin. Is there anything you're not prepared for? I hope not, my sweetmuah. I hope not. What? It seems to be rainin' in here? Man the buckets, my good man. Sure thing, Mr. Penguin. it's raining in here. It's raining in the house. I've never seen anything like this. Pass out the emergency umbrellas, Dove. Right away, Mr. Penguin. Hi. Here you are, folks. Take your umbrellas. Oh, he's going to give us umbrellas. The Penguin and umbrellas? It spells trouble. Well, sure then I'm glad we're on the guest list. - Oh. - Yes. Oh! How charming and unusual! An indoor wedding in the rain. All the gifts are on display and we have a charming buffet. Open your umbrellas. It's raining heavily in here. - Yes. - Watch the bucket. How do you do? How do you do? Thank you. Thank you. Great Scot! The wedding presents. One of your criminals has done that. He's taken advantage of this bizarre confusion to steal my dowry. If you want to see the crook who's behind this look in the mirror. Mirror, mirror. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest fink of all? Oh! Pengy, they fainted! Well, don't get upset. We'll get to the bottom of this. - Eagle-Eye, Dove, come here. - Yes. - Let's go. - Where to, boss? Well, the criminals must be below. Quick, to the elevator. We'll apprehend them. Or we'll die in the attempt. Yes, yes. Oh. Behold! What a criminal cornucopia! - Penguin, you're a genius. - Of course, I'm a genius. It's too bad that our two costume clowns aren't here to see my triumph. Into our Birdmobile. 'We'll fly like the wind to our secret' 'impregnable hideaway. ' On the brilliant bird of mine On the brilliant bird of mine A fortune in wedding gifts and still a bachelor. What a dastardly twisted plot! That Penguin's some foul bird. Not only robbing his own wedding, but leaving that trusting girl at the altar. - Let's go get him, huh? - Right you are, Robin. Let's see how his course is coming in on the mobile Bat-cycle Bat-scanner. He's just passing Gotham City limits. Right, let's go. A bachelor's life is the life for me Titwillow titwillow titwillow A bachelor's life is the life for me Titwillow Titwillow Titwillow We're gaining, Batman. Bat-scanner says range 7-4-9-0. Lucky for us he doesn't know how to actuate the super speed afterburner. Time to jolt him with our gimmicks, huh? Roger. We'll start by giving his two stooges a short sweet voyage into space. Here goes the remote control ejection button. Eagle-Eye! Dove! Thundering feathers! I must have accidentally hit some dratted button. Now, for amusing fun with the doors. Fouled up second hand car I say. Blazing icebergs! This bird is beginning to fly here! Come here, you black raven. . Look. Look at him, Robin. That crooked bird is going crazy. Be careful, Batman. We don't want him to smash up the Batmobile. Good point, Robin. I'll take over the steering now by remote control. Great meltin' icebergs! This beast seems out of my control. Watch the range now. Hold tight, Penguin. Emergency turn coming up. Forget the scenic route, you black vulture. Just get me back on the main road. Look, Batman, Penguin's ugly guts. Let's rack 'em up, huh? You see what I see, Dove. What is it, Eagle-Eye? I see ghosts on a Bat-cycle! Ghosts, huh? I don't think you crooks have the right spirit! The Batmobile. Let's get the controls. Back from the grave, you tricksters, eh? Back to send you on a honeymoon cruise, Penguin. Up the river to the pen! - Gone straight, huh? - We'll straighten you out! - Case closed, Batman? - Yes, except for one detail. - What's that? - The Batmobile. We'll have to have it fumigated. Here you are, Miss Starr. All the stolen gifts recovered. I wonder. What Miss Starr? The love and affection I'd provide. It might be just the thing that would turn him into an honest, law-abiding citizen. Great scot, Miss Starr! You'd still consider becoming that crooked bird's wife? Why not? I'd make him a nest where he'd feel warm and protected and loved. It's a challenge to quicken any woman's heart. Officer, bring in Penguin. Oh, my dear, Pengy. - My poor little sick bird. - It was mine. I tell you it was all in my grip. This was my oil well. And this is my solid gold dinner silver. And this was my diamond-studded can opener. You greedy bird! Have you no conscience? This woman loves you. She's still willing to marry you. Who, me? The Penguin? Married and kept in a bathtub? I love you, Pengy. I'd try very hard to reform you. Great heavenly ice floats! Take me to prison! Next week, return match with the Riddler.

NARRATOR". A peaceful day in Gotham City. But at the Gotham City branch of the Mint the peace is about to be shattered by a familiar feathered felon. -Hey-- -Get going. Hwah, hwah, hwah. Come on, follow me. - Hands up. -Penguin, what do you want here? I'm here to get a gift for my lady love. What do you want, my dear? Well, I don't know, Pengy. Um, ha, ha. What do they have? Ha, ha. Well, there's a very fine ink. Would you like that? - Just plain ink? -Green ink. Green ink, my love. And here's some fine paper. You get the idea? - Oh, Pengy, I'm beginning to catch on. -Of course, you are. You see, green ink and paper make a very interesting combination. Perfect. There's your money. Wheelbarrows full of money. And when Barbara told me she'd been elected chairman of the Gotham City anti-littering campaign - Daddy arranged for this meeting, Bruce. -I'm glad he did, Barbara. Never hurts to remind anyone of the litter basket. Gosh, yes. A clean city is a healthy city. - Then we can count on your support. -Of course. A call for Commissioner Gordon, sir. - Take it there. -Oh, thank you, Alfred. Commissioner Gordon. Terrible news, Chief O'Hara. Use the red phone and call Batman immediately. I'll hold on to this line. - Anything serious, commissioner? -Penguin's just been reported in the Mint. - Penguin in the Mint? That is serious. - Yeah. Oh, sir, this is perhaps an inopportune moment but the downstairs hot water line has burst once again and the shut-off valve seems to be rusted up. I'll give you a hand, Alfred. Would you excuse me? Yeah, surely, surely. Maybe I didn't work it right. Yes, chief-- Commissioner. It's Chief O'Hara, Batman. - Oh, oh. -The commissioner is visiting Bruce Wayne. He wanted me to call you and tell you that The Penguin is back and he's broken into the Mint. -Is he still in the Mint, chief? No, drat the luck. He's already made his escape. We'll be right down, chief. The dynamic do-gooders. You've been helping old ladies across the street, Batman? Hwah, hwah. We're going to help you into a jail cell, you beaked buffoon. Leave my beak out of this, you baby barnacle. - Let's get them, Batman. -No, no! Stop this loutish violence you teenage truant. It offends my cultured soul. Hwah, hwah, hwah. Hwah, hwah, hwah. Come on. There's the blue-coated baboon and his boorish boss. Perfect witnesses, Pengy, when you bring suit for false arrest. False arrest? I'm afraid it's true, Boy Wonder. You mean, The Penguin has committed no crime, Chief O'Hara? He didn't steal a thing from the Mint. Not one red cent, Batman. I just talked to the supervisor. I didn't steal a thing. And what do you say to a million-dollar lawsuit, eh? What do you say to the fact that you're still guilty of breaking and entering and therefore your arrest was not false? -What? By golly, you're right, Batman. The slimy bird outsmarted himself. This is trickery. This is low, conniving trickery. The only trickery was on your part, Penguin. So for the present, you drop the lawsuit, we'll drop the charges. Now, Commissioner Gordon, would you like us to show these uninvited guests out of your office? Very definitely, Batman. - Hwah. We're going. That's right, we're going. -Or maybe you'd like a helping hand, huh? You sure outwitted that waddling weasel, Batman. But why did you let him go? We couldn't have held him long on those minor charges, commissioner. He must've gone daft, breaking into the Mint for no reason. - I'm sure he had a reason, Chief O'Hara. -But if he didn't take anything out of the Mint - Maybe he put something in. -Batgirl. How did you know about this, Batgirl? I just happened to be driving by the Mint, Batman and saw the police cars. Why? Oh, just curious. But your hunch is a shrewd one, Batgirl. I might also add, the police found all the Mint employees - fast asleep. - Asleep? Penguin always uses gas, Batman. But Penguin gas wears off quickly, Robin. I suggest we take a tour of that Mint. We'll be in touch, commissioner. Great Scott. Take a look, Robin. Looks like a bunch of miniature tadpoles, Batman. Batgirl? Bacteria. They seemed to be of the species somnophilia. Somnophilia lygeria to be exact, Batgirl. Lygerian Sleeping Sickness. They're normally carried by the Lygerian fruit fly. In this case, Penguin was able to plant a culture of the bacteria in the ink used in making this money. Officer, have any bills been shipped out of here since Penguin made his raid? I'm afraid so, Batman. Gotham National Bank picked up a load not half an hour ago. There's no time to lose. Batgirl, you go to the bank. Robin and I will go to Gotham General Hospital and meet you later at the bank. The hospital? Yes, it's the only place in the country that carries a supply of B-6 vaccine. And B-6 vaccine is the only known antidote for Lygerian Sleeping Sickness. Holy hypodermics. We'd better get our hands on it fast. NARRATOR". But at the Gotham General Hospital a certain well-known bird is up to his usual well-known tricks. Hurry up with that hypo. And give him a double dose too. Gee, boss, do I have to? Unless you wanna sleep the rest of your life, dolt. There is no fun in that, is there, Dustbag? All right, jab him. Go ahead before I do some jabbing myself. Very good. Now we're all inoculated. Where's the rest of the vaccine? Come on, hand it over before I demonstrate the famous Penguin technique of open-heart surgery. Very good. Is this all of it? Huh? You don't talk much, do you? He's a mute doctor. Here we are. Ah. Now we're the only people in Gotham City protected against the Lygerian Sleeping Sickness. Hwah, hwah, hwah. You're not protected against a good right jab, you slimy bird. It's beddy-bye for you, Penguin. Nobody catches The Penguin sleeping, dynamic dreamers. Try this on for size. The lethal Lygerian fruit fly. Pleasant dreams, Batfink. Look out, Robin. They are deadly. Missed. They're too fast, Batman. What about the Insecticide Bat-bomb? I left it in the Batmobile. But we dare not open that door until all three of these flies are dead. Fortunately I brought my All-Purpose Bat-Swatter. - You got one, Batman. -TouchÃ©. You got another one. That means there's one left, Robin. Batman. Don't breathe, Robin. Hold perfectly still. This calls for the Bat-tweezers. One bite from this fruit fly, Robin and you might have been asleep for years. Holy Rip van Winkle. But this specimen might prove quite rewarding research-wise. Hold that, Robin. In the bottle. Gingerly, gingerly. Ah. Doctor, has Penguin disposed of all that B-6 vaccine? I'm afraid so, and the only other supply is in Lygeria. Telephone Lygeria. Have them fly fruit fly vaccine here immediately. All right, Batman, but "immediately" means 24 hours. Twenty-four hours of hope. Hope that Penguin has no more of those fruit flies on hand. And that Batgirl reached Gotham National to prevent circulation of the infected money. Yes, that money can be as dangerous as those fruit flies. To the bank, Robin. Well, we're out or luck, Batgirl. Thirteen thousand dollars has already been distributed. - To whom? -To whomever came in today. Then that infected money could be anywhere in Gotham City right now. We missed, Batman, - What about the vaccine? -Penguin beat us to it. And it'll take at least 24 hours before we can get any more. That means everyone in Gotham City will be vulnerable to Lygerian Sleeping Sickness because of those contaminated bills. Yes, there's only one thing to do. May I use your telephone? Commissioner. I want you to notify all radio and TV stations to broadcast the following message: "Some of the money now circulating in Gotham City carries a deadly disease. No one is to handle any of this money. Repeat. No one is to come in contact with any of this money. " Isn't that rather drastic, Batman? There's no other way, commissioner. We don't know what money is infected and what money is not. We must prevent contact with any of it. Of course, Batman. I'll see to it right away. Thank you. Batgirl, Robin and I will meet you in a couple of hours. - We have some things to attend to. - I'll be here. We interrupt our music to bring you a special bulletin. Some of the money in Gotham City has been infected with a deadly tropical disease. Any contact with money now circulating in Gotham City may be extremely dangerous. - How did it go? -Like taking candy from a baby. I never thought it'd be so easy. We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin. Some of the money in Gotham City has been infected with a deadly tropical disease. Any contact with money now circulating in Gotham City may be extremely dangerous. I just love sweeping up. I never thought I'd like being a trash collector, boss. It's different when there's gold in the garbage, huh? Hwah. There's trash of another color on the horizon. Bat trash. Consider your collecting career over, Penguin. Shall we finish her off, boss? No, no, no, business before pleasure, Dustbag. With all this moola lying around, there's no time to bother with Batgirl. Onward and upward. Sweep, brother, sweep with care There's a bunch of moola everywhere Sweep, brother, sweep with care There's money, money everywhere Sweep, brother, sweep Sweep, brother, sweep Hello, Ibn Mukdash? This is Bruce Wayne. No, no, it's not about my oil interests. I called to tell you that the currency here in Gotham City is infected with a dangerous disease. I wanna warn you against accepting any of it for the next few days. You're quite welcome. You might pass the information on to the other financiers in your area of the world. Yes, goodbye, Ibn. Is that, uh? - Carpathia. -Thank you. Hello? Hello, Mr. Bolescu. NARRATOR". And in a warehouse near the outskirts of the city There's millions! And plenty more in the streets ready for us to pick up. Oh, Pengy, are you going to buy me something? Yes, anything your evil little heart desires, you just name it. Hmm? I've always wanted a little house in the country. One house in the country coming up. Where's that phone? Ah, here it is. Hello, operator, would you give me the headquarters of the World League of Nations? Why are you calling them for, Pengy?' You said you wanted a house in the country, I gotta buy you a country to put the house in. Hello, World League of Nations? I'd like to buy a country. What have you got? No. I don't want that one. I'm allergic to vodka. Heh. Something a little smaller, you know, with a few mountains, a little seacoast. Yeah, that'll be fine. I'll take it. I'll pay cash. The name is Penguin. Address: Gotham City. What do you mean? What do you mean you can't accept my money? It's perfectly good money. I don't care what Bruce Wayne said. What? Wait a minute. Hello? Hello! Hwah, hwah, hwah! Penguin, why don't you try somewhere else? After all, Bruce Wayne can't have notified everyone in the world. All right, how would you like some diamonds, a couple of hundred pounds of them, huh? You like that, my dear? You're a doll. It's perfectly good money. You can't do this to me! Hwah, hwah. Here we are, knee-deep in money, and we can't even buy a stick of gum. That millionaire fink Bruce Wayne has warned everybody in the world about me. Well, he'll learn that nobody crosses The Penguin and gets away with it. Hwah, hwah, hwah. Thanks to your calls, Batman there's probably no one in the world who will accept Penguin's money. A brilliant idea. Merely common sense, old churn. If you can't spend it, money is just a lot of worthless paper, isn't it? And that's exactly what Penguin has, a pile of worthless green paper. Our main worry right now lies elsewhere, Robin. Lygerian fruit flies such as the one under this microscope pose a frightening and lethal threat. If Penguin has any more of them, and he probably does he's may be fiend enough to loose them all on Gotham City in a fit of rage when he finds he can't spend that money that he's swept up. - The weather forecast, Alfred? -I make it clear and cool, sir. Temperature approximately, uh, 45 degrees. - Are you sure, Alfred? -Sure as any weatherman can be, sir. That's probably our feathered friend. Bruce Wayne. I know all about your calls to world financiers, you fink. Now you listen to this. Unless you call every one of them back and tell them to accept my money I will let 500 Lygerian fruit flies loose on Gotham City. I refuse your ultimatum, Penguin. And I will not reverse any of those calls. All right, Wayne. You have just doomed Gotham City to 1000 years of very sound sleep. Hwah, hwah, hwah. Hop on, my little baby. Come on, my little sweetheart. Here we are. Listen to them. Maybe the money's contaminated but the diamonds and the jewelry aren't. We'll put the whole city to sleep and then we'll loot it, we'll strip it clean. But I thought Batman and Robin were with you, Batgirl. I haven't seen them since they left the bank. - Maybe that devious devil, The Penguin-- -Don't say it, chief. Don't even think it. If Batman has been harmed Thank heavens. Batman, are you all right? When we didn't hear from you, we-- Yes, commissioner, Robin and I had some important matters to attend to. Is Batgirl there? - Yes, she is. -Good. Yes, sir. Very well. Don't worry, we'll be there. We're to meet them at Gotham National Bank. The fruit flies really did their work. They're all sleeping like babies. Even this mutton-headed police chief. Of course he looks like he's sleeping even when he's awake. What have we got here? A watch. This is no more than I deserve. A very fine watch. You won't be needing a watch where you're going. - What? -You'll need a calendar. A 20-year calendar. This is impossible. You're all infected with Lygerian Sleeping Sickness. Oh, you see, that's what happens, Pengy-poo when you send out a fly to do a man's job. That's right, Pengy-poo. We're just sleepwalking. What do you say to a little sleep-fighting, Robin? Good idea, Batgirl. - Get them finks! Get them! -We'll handle this. Get them! Hwah, hwah, hwah. No! Take your fumbling fingers off my person, Batman. You used a foul trick to murder those innocent fruit flies. You murdered them, Penguin, when you let them out. My recent research on Lygerian fruit flies has proved conclusively that Gotham City's caused an inversion of air layers. Which, in turn, raised the atmospheric pressure and crushed the flies to death. - That's right, Batgirl. - I've been tricked. You tricked yourself, Penguin. Just as you did when you had that doctor give you a double dose of B-6 vaccine. So large a dose, you'll probably contract Lygerian Sleeping Sickness yourself. Me? Ha, ha. That's impose-- You know what? That's impossible. That's impo-- What? Impossible. - Well, you stopped the Penguin cold, Batman. -Cold indeed. Now, how did you know it would be cold? I consulted a very reliable weather forecaster who predicted that today would be clear and cool. Well, he was certainly right about it being cool but those clouds up there don't look very clear. After all, even the best of Weathermen is entitled to an occasional miss. It was very nice of each of you to drop by separately and unannounced. I was in the neighborhood, Barbara, and I thought you might buy me a cup of coffee. Oh, make that two cups, Barbara. I just get tired being at the office. I don't blame you, Daddy. I'm amazed your office does everything it manages to do. Foiling Penguin and his tainted money scheme and ridding Gotham City of those deadly Lygerian fruit flies. Oh, but as usual, Barbara, the majority of credit goes to Batman and Robin. - Don't forget to mention Batgirl, commissioner. -Yes, yes, a remarkable young woman. I wonder who in the world she really is. Hello. Yes, Bonnie, he's right here. Daddy. What is it, Bonnie? Warden Crichton on the other phone, yes. Calling about two women who keep visiting Shame at Gotham State Prison? Calamity Jan and Frontier Fanny? Staying somewhere in Gotham City. Tell the warden I'll look into it at once. NARRATOR". But little does Commissioner Gordon know what he's about to see or what trouble that double-dealing desperado Shame is hatching right now with Calamity Jan and Frontier Fanny in the prison visiting room and which will explode before everyone's eyes on our next episode. 
NARRATOR". Gotham City, like any other large metropolis, abounds in the quaint shop the unique store. And what could be a more bizarre emporium than Bon Ben's Box Boutique? Open early on this sunny morning almost as if awaiting some equally bizarre customers. Well, good morning, gentlemen. Something in empty boxes today? We're looking for some empty hat boxes. A lot of empty hat boxes. Well, you've really come to the right place. I have a collection of empty hat boxes unparalleled in all of Gotham City. Good, 700 of these would be fine. - Do you want them delivered? -We'll take them with us. Seven hundred hat boxes? There are three of us. Cash or charge? That is of no concern to me, madam as I don't intend to pay for them in either case. Oh. NARRATOR". Meanwhile behind the boxwood hedges and boxing shutters of stately Wayne Manor And so, Professor Overbeck as head of the Wayne Foundation, it gives me great pleasure to present to you this check which, in some small way, may help you with your fine work at the Gotham City Atomic Energy Laboratories. Oh! Mr. Wayne, it gives me great pleasure to accept this. Heh. The Batphone, sir. - Thank you, Alfred. I may need your help, Dick. -Sure, Bruce. Now, if you'll excuse me, professor, I have some other matters connected with the foundation. But of course, Mr. Wayne. It will give me a moment with this charming lady to thank her for the delightful luncheon. You know, you know, Mrs. Cooper, I really mean it. You have a certain way with a strudel. Stole 700 hat boxes from Bon Bon's Box Boutique? There's little doubt about the culprit's identity, Batman. Warden Crichton tells me the convicts were enjoying a softball game last week and the Mad Hatter stole home and kept right on going in Warden Crichton's cap. The warden was acting as umpire. Keep calm, commissioner. We'll be right there. To the Batpoles. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Roger. Ready to move out. So I'd say it's following the old familiar pattern of the Mad Hatter. - But he hasn't stolen any hats. -One hat, Robin. Or rather a cap belonging to Warden Crichton along with home plate at the penitentiary. Which they found between the prison's baseball diamond and the tennis courts. Sometimes I wonder if the warden's rehabilitation program isn't getting out of hand. And of course there were the 700 hat boxes along with the attack on the proprietress of the Box Boutique. Sure, and that all adds up to at least a little larceny. That adds up to serious trouble, Chief O'Hara. Who knows what disaster lies ahead when a man of the Mad Hatter's twisted tendencies is loose in Gotham City? And who knows what lies in store for you, Batman? He'd stop at nothing to add that cowl to his horrific hoard of headpieces. The loss of my cowl is secondary, commissioner. But not the fate of Gotham City. Right. This monster must be stopped at once. Where will we begin, Batman? The prison ballpark or the box shops? That's all after the fact, Robin. We must anticipate his next move. And I believe the Batcave is the place for that. Excuse us, please. Looking back, Chief O'Hara, it's hard to remember how we operated at all before those two masked Samaritans appeared on the scene. It's not hard for me to remember, commissioner. Things were a mess. NARRATOR". Masked Samaritans or not, it looks like things may get even messier judging by what's going on in the Mad Hatter's current hideaway in the defunct Green Derby Restaurant. It's like losing old friends, Polly, putting these hats away. Take this shako, for instance. Ho-ho! How startled the guardsman was when I lifted it during a time when he was trooping the royal colors. Wasn't that risky, Jervis? A bit touch-and-go. Especially when the king ordered my execution. But I escaped. With this noose. Hardly a hat, but in its way, a kind of headwear. Aha. And the sultan of Shargreve how startled he was when I lifted this during a tiger hunt. You certainly were asking for trouble that time, Jervis. A soupgon. What puzzles me, Jervis, is why you're packing all this heisted headgear. Times change, Polly, and people with them. Stealing hats has lost its fascination for me. You mean you're going straight? Hardly. Do you think I've blown my lid? This phase in my career will never be over until the Caped Crusader's cowl is safely in my custody. Oh, gee, Jervis. You had me worried for a minute. I mean, a hat-check girl without any hats to check is And after that I'm going to change my tactics and use hats to steal. Hats to steal? I'm puzzled again. Well, it's a plan which is better understood as it unfolds, Polly involving as it does the Headdress Ball tonight at which you will be in charge of the hat-check stand plus the Three-Tailed Pasha of Panchagorum plus this plastic gun filled with radioactive spray plus the Golden Buddha of Bergama and the priceless ruby in its forehead and finally plus that elevated water tank at the rear of this property. Down the ladder of which Benny and Skimmer are now climbing. What on earth are they doing in the water tank? Preparing a watery grave, elevated of course for the Caped Crusader. If I don't think of a trickier means of disposing of Batman first. "Sombrero. Sunbonnet Pith helmet. Tam-0'-shanter. Skullcap. Snood. " I don't see how we'll anticipate Mad Hatter's next malicious move just by getting a lot of cards from a Batcomputer, Batman. You're right, Robin. No doubt even that mechanical marvel feels the stress and strain of crime-fighting and has chosen this particular moment to letdown. Perhaps if I activated the Accelerated Concentration Switch. Holy handiwork, Batman. A new attack entirely. "The Top Hat Room. The Headdress Ball. Hattie Hatfield. " Of course. I should have made the connection myself, Robin. Perhaps I, too, have become remiss. Well, what is the connection? Gotham City's Annual Charity Headdress Ball is being held tonight at the Gotham Towers West in the Top Hat Room. And Hattie Hatfield uh, Gotham City's current grande dame of local society is the head of the event. Isn't she the owner of the famous Hatfield ruby? Right, Robin. And as I recall reading in the morning's gossip column the magnificent headdress worn tonight by Ms. Hatfield will be held in place by that ruby. Oh, that should draw Mad Hatter like a magnet. No doubt, old chum. So as we have one of our infrequent free afternoons I think we should run a check on our Batarangs and our Bat-ropes. We did that right after our last Bat-climb. Forewarned, forearmed, Robin. All the walls of the Gotham Towers West are sheer glass. NARRATOR". But even as the Headdress Ball gets underway what surprising news is this hotel manager receiving in the foyer of the Top Hat Room? The Three-Tailed Pasha of Panchagorum? Yes, he's in Gotham City incognito. And he's asked me, as First Secretary of the Panchagorum Consulate to tell you that he'd love to drop in on the Headdress Ball for a few moments. Incognito, of course. To observe the folkways and native customs. But he's a very simple man and he trusts that there will be no burden on hotel security. Oh, no, no. Assure him, sir, that it will not. No, for the Three-Tailed Pasha, we shall be most unobtrusive. Heh. EXCUSE TUE, EXCUSE me, EXCUSE me. I think I'd better alert you, honey. The Three-Tailed Pasha of Panchagorum is about to drop in on this little affair any minute. Oh? Then I'll give him a three-tailed hat check. He doesn't want word to get out, but I'd better tell Hattie Hatfield. - I hear Jervis is on his way up. -Right. Is, uh, everything set? Skimmer and the rest of the boys are at their stations. The Three-Tailed Pasha of Panchagorum? Did you hear that, Mabel? NARRATOR". But while the pasha ascends by elevator the dynamic duo make a less orthodox approach up the sheer glass wall. Looked like a fancy affair down on the 62nd floor, Batman. Just goes to show, Robin, that people who stay in glass hotels shouldn't throw parties. Eyes front. After all, we're not social climbers. NARRATOR". Meanwhile back at the classy clambake Care to check your three-tailed hat, sir? I never leave my hat with anyone. My three-horsetailed tassels are a symbol of my high rank as a Panchagorum military commander. Then perhaps your gloves. Nor my gloves, either. In this one, I have my reliable ruby retriever. But, uh, what a unique custom. Leaving articles of clothing with a pretty young lady at the door. I must initiate that in my Panchagorum harems. I'm Hattie Hatfield, Your Three-Tailed Excellency. Then word has gotten out. I really wanted this little visit to be incognito. - Who's that? -Mad Hatter, Robin. Who else? Why three horsetails on his fez? Obviously a ruse of some kind. Let's slip in and find a better vantage point. I'm sure we'll be unnoticed. In Panchagorum I travel unnoticed, and prefer it that way. Such a humble man. Oh, I love your hat. What a unique place to wear your three tails. - A concession to the changing times. -Heh. The buffet? Some champagne for His Three-Tailed Pasha. And some caviar. He's so charming. He's so democratic. Batman and Robin are hiding behind the table. Yeah, ready for action. And they'll get it. No, thank you. You mean I can't interest you in anything? Oh, I didn't say that, dear lady. That headdress of yours is very interesting. Particularly that beautiful ruby. - On your mark. -Compared to it the famous stones of Panchagorum are faded and lifeless. But it's really nothing. It's a family heirloom. Get set. But what brilliance. Go. Batman and Robin. What are you doing here? The Three-Tailed Pasha is an imposter, Ms. Hatfield. If you'll check your headdress, you'll see that your ruby is gone. It's gone. Back, citizens. And now you, Mad Hatter. Not until I toss my hat into the ring, Batman. Holy fireworks! Look out, Batman, knock-out gas. No, Boy Wonder, something much more effective. Radioactive spray. Try this on your cowl for size. You diabolical devil. Not one step forward, Boy Wonder, or you'll get it too. Don't take that step, Robin. Why, you three-tailed-- Your cowl, Batman. It's turned bright pink. A form of virulent radiation, Robin. Quickly. Back to the Batcave before it is too late. Sir, all your other cowls are in the Home Dry Bat-cleaning Plant. It's turned up to full-maximum. But even so, I'm afraid they won't be ready for another couple of hours at least. Holy self-service. What about the new cowls you've been working on, Alfred? The material I ordered hasn't arrived yet. A trend of the times, I'm afraid, sir. We've gotta do something. I know a little about radioactivity and its effect on human tissue. If you're worrying about me, Robin, don't. The Anti Radioactive Bat-pill that I took should hold me for a short while longer. Of greater importance is getting a usable cowl and to use it in apprehending Mad Hatter. Alfred, turn the Home Dry Bat-cleaning Plant from full-maximum to super-instant while millionaire Bruce Wayne makes a telephone call. - Very good, sir. -Bruce Wayne? Yes, to Professor Overbeck of the Gotham City Atomic Energy Laboratories. This morning Mr. Wayne presented Professor Overbeck with a sizable check for his fine work. Perhaps the good professor would like to return the favor by doing something for Mr. Wayne's friend, Batman. Yes, Mr. Batman, Mr. Wayne did call. And I'll be glad to help you in any way I can. But that cowl. Ach du lieber, that cowl. You know, I'm not sure that our most advanced decontaminating processes will be of help. However, we will try. I'll have my assistant bring you a hooded protective suit at once while you are waiting here. Just one moment, please. On your toes, Robin. The night has eyes and ears. Gosh, Batman, that one stumps me. I didn't have time to explain it on the outside but we were followed here at least part of the way. Mad Hatter? No doubt anticipating our every move. And what better place to retrieve my cowl than somewhere I voluntarily remove it. He may be in for a little surprise. Otto. Otto. Otto. Yes, professor? Where have you been, Otto? Look, when I call I expect an answer. I'm answering, professor. I'm answering. Now, look, Otto, I have here Herr Batman with me in a radioactive cowl which has to be decontaminated. Now, will you please bring me one hooded protective suit at once. Yes, professor, yes. Give me a hand with that hooded protective suit, and then find me another. So little is known about this radioactivity of radioactive agents. So little is known that we only know one thing, that eventually they are deadly. Gosh, Batman. I hope that pill is still working. The effects are beginning to wear off faintly. Ah, here he is. Thank you. Thank you. Now, Herr Batman, will you please slip out of your cowl and get into this? Yes, and, oh, I remember, you don't want to reveal your identity so use this, will you, please. - Need any help, Batman? -No, Robin. Just remember, eyes and ears. So your name's Otto. Oh, excuse me, Wonder Boy. I should have introduced you. Yes, this is Otto. Otto Puffendorfer. You see, he's my reliable assistant ever since I had a little laboratory way back in the old country. - Here you are, professor. - Yeah, yes-- Oh, no, no. No? Ah. Otto, Otto, take this out and have it decontaminated. - Just a minute, Otto Puffendorfer. -Unhand me, Boy Birdbrain. - Oh! -Now I have what I've always wanted. That wasn't Otto. - No, it was Mad Hatter. -Aah! Herr Batman. - How could you have two cowls? - I'll explain later, professor. - Is there another door into that room? -Down the hall. I have Batman's cowl. The crowning achievement of my career. The end of his. And the end of crime-fighting in Gotham City, boss. Oh, such sweet victory. Don't count us out yet, gentlemen. Victory and defeat are of the same price, Mad Hatter. It's some kind of a trick. That can't be Batman. As well as you can be the Three-tailed Pasha of Panchagorum. And Professor Overbeck's assistant, Mad Hatter? - I'll take that cowl. - That cowl's contaminated. Sic them! Sic them! Sic them! Herr Batman, Herr Batman. Robin is trapped in a fluoroscopic cabinet. It's a high-voltage x-ray. Oh, Herr Bat-- Aah! Otto. Otto. Somebody. Mr. Fancy-Hatter, they'll be x-rayed forever. They'll be radiated in a matter of minutes. Don't worry, my friend. You don't need to watch. Happy tin-types, dynamic duo. 
NARRATOR". A glorious morning in Gotham City. But in Commissioner Gordon's office, the Siren readies a nasty scheme. Now, commissioner, you are ready to do my bidding. Your merest wish is my ultimate command. Just say "yes," that will be sufficient, although superfluous. No man can resist the stunning note of my voice. Two octaves above high C. - I want you to call Batman. -Batman? Call him and have him meet you in some neutral place. If you desire. How about--? - How about my daughter's apartment? -Splendid. - What am I to say to him? -Nothing. - Nothing? -You will not show up for the meeting. Just be sure you know where he parks the Batmobile. In the underground garage of her apartment building. Where else? How superbly suitable. Barbara Gordon's apartment? Why there? Ours is not to reason why, Dick. We're duly deputized minions of the law Commissioner Gordon is our immediate superior and good crime-fighters always obey orders. - To the Batpoles. -Roger. NARRATOR". And now, in Barbara Gordon's apartment, the mystery deepens. I can't fathom it. This is the first time Commissioner Gordon failed to keep an appointment. It's not like him. Not like him at all. I was looking for him myself. And his secretary, Bonnie, thought he might be coming here. - I certainly hope nothing's happened to him. -Gosh, yes. But why would he wanna meet us here and not in his office? He must have had a very good reason, Robin. Commissioner Gordon does not take his responsibilities lightly. I don't know how long they'll be there, so work fast. Now, remember, your primary mission is to discover the location of the Batcave and the true identities of Robin and Batman. With that knowledge as a weapon plus the fortune that I plan to get from millionaire Bruce Wayne my plan will be complete. It's a beautiful plan. Beautiful. Heh. Would any of you care for a soft drink? No, thank you, Ms. Gordon. We might find it too relaxing. First order of business is to locate your father. Sure, and that's the truth. Perhaps the Batcomputer could be of some help, Robin. Roger. Goodbye, Ms. Gordon. And don't worry about your father. NARRATOR". And shortly, in the Siren's hideout in a subterranean grotto Batman and Robin, you're finished, I say. For hidden inside of your car, Commissioner Gordon is lurking and soon he'll tell me whoever you are. Ha, ha. Nothing quite so pleasant as a musical interlude, eh, boys? You hired us to be criminals, Siren, not critics. All we've been doing is losing a week of time while you sit around and strum the strings. Patience, I can see, is not one of your virtues, if indeed you have any. But you needn't wait much longer, my dear Allegro. The first step in my fantastic plan has already been completed. Even as we converse, my operation is rapidly coming to fruition. Like most women, you keep talking about your operation. But you still haven't told us what it is. For openers, boys, who remembers the good women of history? Florence Nightingale and Molly Pitcher they pale in comparison to Mata Hari, Lucrezia Borgia and Lady Macbeth. Evil is what makes the world go round. And I want to be evil. I'm not knocking evil, Siren. But don't forget Catwoman and Black Widow, they all went up the river because of Batman. Right you are, my musical mobster. But those amateurs neglected one thing. They neglected to expose Batman's identity. Once that's done the cowled crime-fighter's efficiency will be dissipated leaving me a clear path to ravage and pillage Gotham City as it's never been ravaged and pillaged before. I want to become the wickedest woman in Gotham City and thus, in the world. With the help of Bruce Wayne's fortune which I shall shortly control. Barbara, it doesn't look as though your father is going to show up. I'm afraid you're right, Chief O'Hara. I'll be getting back to the office. If I hear from him, I'll call you. Do that. Even if I'm out, I'll get the message. Even if you're out, you'll answer? Well, not exactly that. My phone answers for me. Oh, sure, then it's one of those tricky little gizmos that answers in your own voice and then replays the messages. Oh, sure, and it is, Chief O'Hara. At least it won't be answering in Lorelei Circe's voice or all the windows would be broken. - Whose voice? -Lorelei Circe. She's the world-famous chanteuse who's appearing in Gotham City. She has a range of seven octaves. And when she sings her highest note I'm told only hunting dogs can hear it, and are completely stunned. Well, let's hope your father doesn't run into her. Oh, I'm just spoofing you, Barbara. I'm sure he'll show up safe and sound. Good bye. Charlie, am I jumping to the world's biggest conclusion? Could my father have run into Lorelei Circe? Lorelei Circe. Lorelei, a temptress a siren who lives in a grotto. The Grotto Arms. I read that's where she's been staying. NARRATOR". What's on Barbara's mind, Charlie? Is she about to go into action as that Dominoed Dare-doll Batgirl? - What is the matter with it? -Perhaps it doesn't understand our question about Commissioner Gordon, Robin. I've never seen that light flash before. Well, that's the Batcomputer Bat-resistance Signal. Of course it doesn't understand our question about Commissioner Gordon. It can't answer it. Commissioner Gordon represents law and order. The Batcomputer is programmed to deal only with criminals. Holy one-track Batcomputer mind. I guess we'll have to figure this one out for ourselves. Not without some nourishment, old churn. The body needs food as well as the mind. Good evening, sir. Through for the day? Just going to grab a bite, then get back to business. Which is, if I may ask? Locating Commissioner Gordon, Alfred. Very good, sir. If you'll excuse me, I have a little dusting to do. You'll find your milk and sandwiches already prepared in the study. Thank you, Alfred. Commissioner Gordon. What are you doing here? YOu? You're Alfred, millionaire Bruce Wayne's butler. And that voice, the same nameless voice that often answers the Batphone. - I'm afraid you're making a mistake, sir. -Mistake? Nonsense. Obviously, this is the Batcave. Ergo, Batman is Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson is Robin, The Boy Wonder. Hmm, hmm. Batman and Bruce Wayne, one and the same. I must convey this information at once to the Siren. The Siren? I think you're making a grave error of judgment, sir. You're being very civilized about this. Most butlers would do anything at this moment to stop me. - Quite right, commissioner. -Oh. Yes, indeed. Nothing. We should get into town and survey the area where Commissioner Gordon was last seen. Perhaps we can find a clue there. You need look no further, sir. - Commissioner Gordon. -Commissioner Gordon. Sound asleep, sir. I found him in the Batcave. Sound asleep in the Batcave? But he was awake when he stepped out of the rear of the Batmobile. Thanks to a sizable dose of Bat-Sleep he is now languishing in the arms of Morpheus. Great Scott. Yes. And I'm afraid he knows the true identities of each of you. In the absence of any word from Commissioner Gordon, I shall now make a call. - Like me to do it, Siren? -Oh, no, Andante. I'm the only person in the world that can deliver my message to Mr. Bruce Wayne. The millionaire playboy? The soon-to-be ex-millionaire playboy. My next move is to relieve Mr. Wayne of his fabulous fortune. With Batman revealed by Commissioner Gordon and thus permanently impaired and with Bruce Wayne's millions in my possession, I'll be unstoppable. Information? I'd like the number of stately Wayne Manor, please. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at their handsome residence, our heroes remained puzzled. - How much Bat-Sleep did you give him, Alfred? -I should say approximately 12 hours worth, sir. What could have caused him to do such a thing? Hide in the Batmobile? Our main concern now is what to do with him. He can't sleep forever and when he wakes up, he intends to tell-- Who was it? - Someone called the Siren, sir. -Obviously, the perpetrator of this sinister plot. Hello? Yes, yes, this is millionaire Bruce Wayne. Meet me in my private office at the Wayne Foundation Building in a half hour? I'll be there. Is everything all right, sir? Everything is fine, Alfred. - Where are you going, Bruce? - That is not your concern, Dick. I have a personal matter to attend to. But you can't leave now. Something's very wrong, Alfred. Bruce never acted that way before. And right after that telephone call, sir. I'm going to see what it's all about. You'll never know unless you answer it, Master Dick. - Hello? -Robin, this is Batgirl. Batgirl. On the Batphone? I'm in Commissioner Gordon's office. No one else is here. I must speak to Batman at once. I'm afraid he's, uh, unavailable right now. Can I help you? Well, perhaps you can. A frightful thing is happening. I can't go into detail over the phone. But by some sort of sonic spell the Siren intends forcing Bruce Wayne to give up his fortune to her. So that's it. And it seems she can project this sound over the phone. I think that's what might have happened to my-- Commissioner Gordon. Meet you at Wayne Foundation Building as soon as possible. - And Batman? -He, uh, may be there too. NARRATOR". Later, in Bruce Wayne's private office in the Wayne Foundation Building You now have the Wayne family jewels. You have everything, including all my ready cash. Oh, there's still the little matter of your signing over the property, stocks and bonds of the Wayne fortune to me. Oh, yes. Do you have the necessary legal forms? Andante. NARRATOR". While in the lobby of the Wayne Foundation Building He must still be under her influence, so we'll have to deal gingerly with Mr. Wayne. You bet. Wouldn't want an innocent man to get hurt. I only wish Batman were here to help us. He may be here sooner than you think. Holy standstills. I wish this elevator would get here. No telling what they're up to. There. That should do it. I now have everything I want. Everything. Except the identity of Batman. Batman? No doubt Commissioner Gordon is back in his office by now and has probably been trying to call them. Commissioner Gordon's office. No, the commissioner is not here. This is Chief of Police O'Hara speaking. May I do something for you? Yes. Go jump in Gotham Park Lake. Ha, ha. We heard that, Siren, and you're sending an innocent man to drown himself. Well, look who's here. Batgirl and Batboy. There's no escape, Siren. Better give yourself up. - We'll soon see about that. - That won't do you any good at all. Girls are impervious to your entrancing voice. And I'm wearing Bat-earplugs that successfully screen out any sound above 14,000 decibels. Your goose, so to speak, is cooked. Not by a long shot, short stuff. I now own this building. Is that true, Mr. Wayne? She now owns this building. And I hereby order you off the premises. This is private property and you cannot come in here without a warrant. She has us there, Robin. Holy Fourth Amendment. So if you'll just make yourselves scarce, I won't have to report you to the police. This way out. Come on, Batgirl. - But there must be some-- -We're licked. You'll pay a pretty price for this, Siren. Let's get this thing over with. - What are you gonna do with him? -Bruce Wayne? That penniless fop? Now that he has no fortune he's going to do what many other bankers in his position have done. He's going to leap off the roof. I'm going to leap off the roof. Good boy. Dropping that bugging device was a smart move, Robin. Maybe not smart enough. They've just taken the elevator to the roof. She's going to make Bruce Wayne jump. - The stairway? -Yes. You're in good shape. Come on, now. Just one more step. Don't do it, Mr. Wayne. Get in there and help my men. Sorry about this, Mr. Wayne. Help me. Help. Why should I? You were willing to let Bruce Wayne leap. Can we talk about it after you pull me up? Can you get Mr. Wayne out of that spell? I-- Can you? I might try singing an antidote note. Then do it. Oh, but that's three octaves above high C. Nobody's ever done it before. My voice would be gone. I'd rather die. I'd rather live. All right, I'll try it. - Oh, Bruce, if only you were more like Batman. -Batman. Perhaps then you would have had the strength to resist the Siren's stunning spell. All right, Siren, do your stuff. Robin. - Batgirl. What's going on here? -Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Wayne. You're all right now. What about the others? Chief O'Hara. Here we go. Oh. Batman. Barbara. What's going on? You were under the spell of the Siren, Daddy. The Siren, eh? Hmm. The last thing I remember is That's funny. I can't remember the last thing I remember. Permanent amnesia apparently lasts as long as a person is under Siren's spell. I feel like Rip van Winkle. You only slept like him. Batman and Robin took care of things perfectly. Don't forget Batgirl. And speaking of Batgirl, she was on her way to fish Chief O'Hara out of-- Gotham Park Lake. And begorra, she did. But after she rescued me, she just vanished. I walked over to the office to dry off but I didn't do much drying. All's well that ends well. Particularly now that millionaire Bruce Wayne's millions have been returned to him. And Siren will be singing her stunning notes from a cage with iron bars. How right you are, Robin. Shall we go? Warden Crichton should find the Siren a model prisoner, commissioner if she doesn't open her mouth. What in the world was that? It's our newly-developed Criminal Sensor Bat-indicator, commissioner which apparently suggests that Penguin has returned to the environs of Gotham City. Lulu. Speak to me, Lulu. Don't call me Lulu, Pengy. It's Senora Lola Lasagne now. Now, I'm not here in Gotham City to be bothered by you. I'm here to enter my prize-winning horse in the Wayne Foundation handicap. We're gonna make a tidy bundle on that race, Lulu. Whah, Whah, whah. And not only Penguin, commissioner but some new female accomplice named Lola Lasagne. NARRATOR". Will Batman need more than luck with Penguin and Lola? Watch the next episode to find out. 
NARRATOR". Outside the Gotham City National Bank wealthy young socialite Miranda Fleece is about to perform an act of charity. Begging your pardon, ma'am, if you don't mind hearing a tale of some real bad luck. I know how it goes, poopsie, say no more. Have a hundred. Heaven bless you. Help, police, fuzz! Amazing. A veritable deluge of counterfeit bills. Being passed not by criminals but by well-known pillars of society. It baffles me completely. Uh, there's something funny about these counterfeits, commissioner, have you noticed? They're blank on one side and completely genuine on the other. Exactly. It's almost as if some deranged mind were trying to taunt our very sanity. Begorra, that laughter. - Where does it come from? -Nowhere, and yet everywhere. Commissioner, I have a terrible feeling we've heard this laughter before. So true, Chief O'Hara, so true, it all fits perfectly. Joker. Once again we take our poor cracked pitcher to the Caped Crusader's well. Gosh, economics is sure a dull subject. Oh, you must be jesting, Dick. Economics dull, the glamour, the romance of commerce it's the very life blood of our country's society. Frankly, I can think of nothing more stimulating than economics and commerce-- Yes, Alfred. Begging your pardon, sir. It's the telephone in the study, sir. Come on, Dick, this may lead us to a more practical lesson in loss and gain. I'm with you. So long, Aunt Harriet. Mercy alive, the way that boy changes his mind. I wonder if he's over-tired. Yes, commissioner? Words are superfluous, Batman, uh, listen. Holy funny bone, The Joker. Courage, commissioner, courage. Joker seldom has the last laugh. To the Batpoles. Saint's preserve us, there it goes again. - Diabolical, I'm being driven out of my senses. -Precisely the fiend's intention, commissioner. Batman's right. Joker knows we'll need every ounce of our sanity to outwit his filthy plot. - Hand me the Bat-Detector, Robin. -Roger. I'll turn it in for super laugh track sensitivity. - Extend your left arm, commissioner. -Pardon? Do as I say, commissioner, extend your left arm. Oh, yeah, sure. Ingenuous, this criminal mirth issues from a tiny, super-powered loud speaker built into your left cuff link. - Great Scott. -Exhibit A. - How the devil did it get there, Batman? -Joker is a master conjurer, Chief O'Hara. No doubt he brushed against the commissioner in a crowd and easily affected the substitution. Stand up, commissioner. Oh, yeah, sure. Ahem. Aha. Just as I suspected the agile crook also managed to slip an induction receiving antenna into your left trouser leg. Exhibit B. Yes, now I remember. Some oddly costumed fellow did bump into me in the subway this morning. Holy chutzpah. Planting criminal radio gear on the police commissioner. No time for emotion, old churn, let's apply our brain power to Joker's plot. This was passed by an innocent dupe? What's more, the woman had just received that bill from the Gotham City National Bank. Gosh, Batman, if we could just puzzle out how funny money is handed out by a bank. Good thinking, Robin. Time for us to go fishing, if you ask me. - Fishing? -But where, Batman? Where the fishing is always best, commissioner, from a shady bank. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, a strange scene unfolds atop this building which houses Penthouse Publishers, formerly innocent purveyors of mirth now the secret headquarters of The Joker. Oh, this continued mirth is exhausting, even for the Clown Prince of Crime. Figure he finally found the gizmo? That dunderhead Gordon, he couldn't find a haystack in a needle factory. No, you can be quite certain, sweet Josie Miller the failure of our tiny receiver means Batman is on the job. Gee, I'm not very glad to hear that, Joker. My foolish, trepidatious child, he's not headed here. Why even as we speak, you can bet he's racing to the bank and doom. Ha, ha. Mr. Yock, Mr. Boff, warm-up time. Those sure are nifty robots, Joker. Comically lifelike, aren't they? They were my manual training project last spell I did in that filthy penitentiary. Do you think they're strong enough to hold Batman and Robin? Observe. Mr. Yock, Mr. Boff practice alert, bats on the premises. There on the table. Smash them, bash them, crash them. Ha, ha! Exterminate them utterly into primordial batstuff. Robots, as you were. At ease. - What's that Joker? -The signal from the bank. Oh. Those blundering bipeds, they've swallowed our bait. Quick, let's watch! Quickly! Watch, my sweet. What's that? Counterfeit currency emanating from this bank, it's impossible. A word one must employ with the greatest of caution, Mr. Flamm. Impossible, I say. Just answer me a question, have there been any recent changes in personnel? Let's see. Yes, our Ms. Pruett left, the date was May 7th, 1951. - No, something more recent. -Nothing whatever, Batman. Except, of course, our chief teller, he went out for a sandwich at noon and didn't return. He did send in a substitute, I'm pleased to say, Mr. Glee. That's him over there. - He had references, of course? -Of course, Batman, impeccable. - Thank you. -Yes. Notice anything odd, Robin? - His rather formal attire. - That and something else. The way he counts out those bills. Holy precision. Indeed, precise to an almost inhuman degree. - Something weird about his collar button too. -Good for you Robin I wondered if you'd noticed. Now if my strange hunch is right - Good afternoon, Mr. Glee. I'm Batman. -Obviously, sir. I've been admiring your collar button. WOW! Oh. The filthy bat creature touched the lens. Tell me, Mr. Glee, why is a collar button like an old pile of burning automobile tires? Answer. Because they both choke. Holy clockworks, a mechanical marvel. I'm flabbergasted, Batman. How on Earth did you know that was a robot? Simple, Mr. Flamm, even the most infallible robots have one defect. They have no sense of humor. Batman told him a funny joke. When the creature didn't laugh that was proof. Well, you wretched ruin, I guess we'll take you back to the Batcave. One last warning, Mr. Flamm. The next time your chief teller goes out for a sandwich and sends a stranger back in his place, scrutinize him carefully. I'm sure I speak for the chairman of the board, millionaire Bruce Wayne in saying that you owe that to all of your depositors. Good day, citizens. Oh, eureka, look. Mr. Glee's retriever signal is coming in as planned. Huh! - The Batmobile. -Oh, yes, my sweet. With Mr. Glee in the trunk. Ha, ha. We'll give pursuit. We'll find the Batcave. Quick to the Jokemobile. Clear the way, you people, clear the way, please clear the way. Turn on the portable robot retriever. Pick up the signal. - Left on Mulberry. - Tallyho. Whoo! What a bat hunt. Holy honey corn, that's a tracking signal. Obviously there's a tiny transmitter built into that robot in the trunk. - You mean, you knew we were being followed? -Oh, yes. What'll we do, Batman, lure them into an ambush and bash them with our Batarangs? I have a better notion. Of course, we'll activate our trusty Bat-deflector. Right again, Robin. Turn it on. Bat-deflector activated. - How's the retriever signal? -Stronger than ever, Joker. Faster. - Right turn. -Strange, I don't see any road. Well, I can't help that, Joker, the signal says right turn. Oh, how humorous. Ha, ha. Hold tight for the bumpsy-daisy. Frabjous day, moment every super crook has dreamed of. Look, we've discovered the entrance to the Batcave. - Which way from here, Joker? -Oh, it must be around that little hill. - Get the gas grenades. -Roger. Oh. We'll gas them out of the cave and get them when they come out. Death to the blundering bats, tallyho. Ha, ha. - What's the matter? -Bizarre, the signal says the Batcave is here. Look, we've been out-tricked. "Laugh, criminals, laugh!" I'll have it. By all the saints of wicked mirth, I'll have it. The last laugh will still be mine. I regret to say, no unusual indications. We're dealing with a perfectly normal robot. Holy dead end, not a clue to where it came from. Excusing the intrusion, sir, but might I point out an oddity in this automaton's attire? By all means, Alfred. His sleeve, sir, now to my practiced eye, uh it would appear that it has been pressed by a most uncommon pressure. He's right, Batman, look. The buttons are pushed almost through the back. And here, sir, I clearly detect traces of multicolored, uh, spots which have been frequently, but clumsily sponged. Congratulations, Alfred, you're keen sartorial sense has done it again. - Thank you, sir. -Robin, warm up the Bat-Spot Analyzer while I take a sample of this affected cloth. -Roger. I'll just snip right through here, Alfred. - Bat-Spot Analyzer ready to go, Batman. -Roger. Now, let's keep our fingers crossed, Robin. Mm-hm. - What is it, Batman? -Those curious spots. They're minute traces of printer's ink. Of course, used by Joker in his counterfeiting operation. Exactly, transferred to the cloth when that Cheapskate pressed his robot's wear in his printing press. Bless my steam iron, how revolting. Revolting, indeed, Alfred, like the colors of these inks arsenic green, rotten apple red, bilious blue. I believe there's just one sort of legitimate printing firm that would employ such hues. - A firm that prints comic books. -Right again, Robin. Now to check our Business Index Machine to see if any such firm has recently changed hands. Penthouse Publishers sold one week ago to a certain Mr. W. C. Whiteface. - Whiteface? Joker. -More than possible, Robin. Too bad we have no proof. Dear me, yes, but if you were to pounce on them like that you'd lay yourself open to a most damaging suit for false arrest. - Gosh, he's got us buffaloed. -Not quite, Robin. I have a plan to get that proof. Listen, here's what we'll do. Infuriating. Here I am on the brink of the greatest caper in criminal history and the Dynamic Duo still at large. I must be dreaming, it looks like millionaire Bruce Wayne. - What? -I'm sure of it, Joker. I've seen his picture in the paper hundreds of times. Robots, amber alert. I'm ruined, bankrupt, wiped out. There's only one more chance. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Whiteface, I failed to introduce myself, I'm Mr. Bruce Wayne. - Oh, at your service, sir. -Thank you. How do you do? I hardly dare ask it, Mr. Whiteface but do you know anyone who could print me up a batch of counterfeit currency? Ooh. What a curious request to make of a legitimate business man such as myself. Yes, I know it does seem a bit odd but you see, I foolishly succumbed to the temptation of speculation with the funds of the Wayne Foundation, the results were catastrophic. Tomorrow is the annual accounting and if I don't have 1 million dollars in cash I will be headed up the river without a paddle. Very interesting, Mr. Wayne, but, uh, why do you come to me? I chanced to be thumbing through one of the comic books that you publish and it struck my eye the inks that you use are identical to the inks used by the United States Treasury. - What do you think, sweet Josie? -Smells like a trap, Joker. Indeed. On the other hand, the fellow's tale is so utterly absurd that it could be true. Uh, just for fun, Mr. Wayne supposing I did provide you with this whimsical funny money? Just what would be in it for me'? I would be happy to appoint you vice chairman of the Gotham National Bank. Oh, dear me, yes, that does appeal to my notorious sense of humor. Vice chairman of the board of the Gotham National Bank. Yes. I have here a personally signed document appointing you to the position I previously mentioned. But before I give it to you, I require proof that you will deliver your end of this unhappy bargain. - Proof? -To wit. You get the document after you run off a sample of counterfeit on your press over there. Hmm. - Josie, ink the rollers, I'll get the paper. Quick. -Yes. - Ready to roll. -Bingo. Hold it, Joker, you're under arrest. Great Scott. It's the junior half of the Dynamic Duo. Robin to Batman, while on a routine anti-crime patrol, I've caught the Joker. He's plotting with Bruce Wayne. Situation under control, no need for you to leave the Batcave. Over and out. Is that so, Boy Wonder. Robots, give him a whimsical whammy. Well, things look grim for our side, Mr. Whiteface perhaps I should lend them a hand. You idiot, you're only getting in the way. Oh, how delicious, the Boy Wonder about to be pressed flat into a comic book. Observe. Mr. Whiteface, this is murder. Well, how true, Mr. Wayne yes, and just to ensure against a double-cross, you will perform it. - Never. -Boff, Yock, seize him. Yes, force his hand on the lever. Gosh, what an ugly twist of fate. 
NARRATOR". A calm afternoon on the floor of the Gotham City Stock Exchange. And in boardrooms throughout the country. But what's this? This can't be happening. I'm wiped out. I made a fortune today. My only problem now is whether to buy amalgamated or consolidated. Cortland, you're the president of the exchange, what do you make of this? I don't know. I've never seen anything like it before. And while it's true the stock exchange has had some wild days in the past never in its history has there been anything comparable to this day. It began shortly after 2:00. At that time Good afternoon, my friends. Where did he come from? Who is that? A helpful Minstrel I When I see folks in trouble Then I come on the double With counsel both soothing and wise With counsel both soothing and wise Ooh. Isn't he attractive? So gentlemanly. For fair remuneration I'll wipe the tears from your eyes I'll wipe the tears from your eyes - Is he talking to us? -Apparently. This message is for members of the Gotham City Stock Exchange. Gentlemen, salvation is available. The Minstrel's Friendly Stock Brokers Protective Association would guarantee you immunity from a repetition of today's calamity. How thoughtful. I'm sure you'll agree the fee is reasonable for the protection provided. $1000 per week per stock exchange member. That's blackmail. Make your checks payable to account number 007 and airmail them each week to the Broccoli Bank in Geneva, Switzerland. I'll expect notice of your agreement to this in tomorrow's Gotham City Times. Let me emphasize that 100 percent participation is essential. - That's a quarter of a million dollars. -We'll fight him. Call a TV station. TV station, nonsense. I'm calling Commissioner Gordon. What are you gonna do, commissioner? There's only one thing we can do. Commissioner Gordon. Yes, indeed. I have the same thought. But who was that? That was Mr. Brook Cortland. President of the Gotham City Stock Exchange. I shall alert him to your call, sir. -It's the-- -I suspected. We were watching, Commissioner Gordon. We'll be right there. To the Batpoles. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Ready to move out. A minstrel who is also an electronic genius. - What a strange combination. -Not at all, commissioner. Music and electronic energy are both transmitted by waves. Which obey almost identical laws of nature. A logical pursuit for a musician with a twisted criminal mind. Of course, Batman, you are right. I wouldn't have thought of that. Commissioner. - Oh, Mr. Cortland. - Commissioner. Batman, this is Mr. Cortland. President of the Gotham City Stock Exchange. Glad to know you. I think we have a mutual friend, that upstanding philanthropist Bruce Wayne. Yes, I've heard him mention your name. And of course, Robin, the Boy Wonder. - How do you do? -How do you do? What happened here this afternoon? The quotations going out over the Trans-Lux went completely wild. Some high, some low, but none right. Orders started pouring in at the false prices and it was, well, it was just a disaster. Do all the quotations go out over a single transmitter? - Yes. - Hm. We better check that installation. Who is this Minstrel? Where did he come from? How did he get on the TV program? The station has no explanation at all. Apparently, he simply overrode the signal from the studio to the transmitter with a stronger one. I don't know anything about this man but I intend to know more about him before we're through. Would you show us the transmission room in the exchange building? Of course. Could your secretary place a call for me, commissioner? Bonnie. My name is Putnam, Batman. Something I can do for you? - And my name is Cortland. -Sorry, Mr. Cortland. I didn't see you. - Go right ahead, Batman. -The transmitter seems perfectly in order. -It's been constant since we had to shut down. -Did technicians check the coding circuits? - At all levels? -Yes. However, I'd like to see them for ourselves. By all means. This way. The circuits are in here. Holy transistor's bill. What an installation. Have you seen anything suspicious, Batman? - Hey, look-- No, Robin. Everything seems to be perfectly in order. No signs of tampering. I told you he wouldn't catch it, Octavia. I guess we 'll just have to keep looking. Right, Batman? Yes, Robin. We'll just have to keep looking. He does have a warm, attractive voice, doesn't he? So what? He's still a second-rate genius. You're just like all the women, Octavia. Taken in by his phony mystique and his-- His warm, attractive voice. Don't complain. I'm pretty taken in by your warm, attractive voice too, you know. Ohh, well, that's better. Ha-ha-ha. Thank you, Mr. Putnam. You can return to your duties. Some of the circuits definitely have been tampered with, gentlemen. And I wouldn't be surprised if he planted a microphone in the installation too. So he could listen in on anybody checking it. How devious and brilliant. Exactly. This Minstrel could present one of the most deadly threats we've ever had to deal with. The devil you say. How do you wish to proceed, Batman? That depends on how he proceeds. If he thinks no one is wise to him, he may be back. And we'll be waiting for him. Just tell me how many men you'll need, Batman. None. The slightest suspicion that it's a trap could scare him off. Sure, and it could at that. Oh, that stick in the head, that is. As always, we'll play it however you wish but we can't help being concerned about you. - Commissioner Gordon, after Penguin -And Archer. -Clock King -And King Tut and Catwoman. and all our other artful adversaries I don't think we'll have too much of a problem with this Minstrel. - Dinner time, sir. -Ah. A peanut butter and watercress sandwich and a glass of milk would have been sufficient, Alfred. -I know, sir. But I can't help worrying about the two of you occasionally. The long hours, the meals you often miss. I hate to see this dual life you're both leading taking its toll. Robin and I still have a few good years left. However, I do appreciate your concern. We'll dine in a moment, Alfred. But first, I'd like to get the kinks out of this bug. Kinks out of the bug, sir? It's a bugging device with which we hope to trap our latest adversary, Alfred. Oh. Would that be the Minstrel, sir? Yes, it is indeed, Alfred. You've heard of him, then? Oh, Gotham City's heard of him, sir. He seems to have most of the women swooning over his so-called gentlemanly charm. And most of the men in a state of panic. Including, if I maybe allowed the personal reference, myself. - You, Alfred? -In panic? Well, I have managed to save a tidy little sum on the side and made what I hope are some wise investments on the stock market. You too, Alfred, wiped out by the Minstrel? No. Not exactly wiped out, Master Robin. I did manage to go down to the stock exchange this morning while you two were in town and it certainly is chaos. Yes. Chaos. Whatever do you suppose the rascal's up to, sir? What he told all of Gotham City via his TV jamming device blackmail or calamity but we intend to prevent both. And how do you intend to trap the culprit? If I may be so inquisitive, sir. I suspect he planted a microphone in the transmissions room of the stock exchange building. And tonight, he'll be back to check on it. So we fight fire with fire. We plant a microphone and we check on it. There's one thing that worries me. Getting back into that building without being noticed. I'm sure that can be handled. - Yes, Batman. - Commissioner. Could you arrange with Mr. Cortland for Robin and me to return to the corridor outside the transmission room tonight? I'm sure he'll cooperate, Batman. And perhaps find us an isolated office for a short time. You mean a temporary hideout? I can't go into details, commissioner. I'm sure you understand. I'll contact Mr. Cortland at once, Batman. But let me repeat now. Please, please be careful. Who knows what devious tricks this evil balladeer maybe up to. You have my assurance. "A Wandering Minstrel. " - That's the same tune he sang on TV. -Right, Robin. - You think it could be some kind of signal? -Yes, it could, old chap. Let's take a look. Easy now. Oh. Oh! Do you always sneak up on people like that? No. That's okay. You here kind of early, aren't you? So you were expecting us. Are you kidding? They told me to expect a new replacement. I just didn't know there'd be two of you. Anyhow, you got here. Glad you wore your old clothes. This jam is a mess. Good evening, gentlemen. Holy rainbow. I'm blinded. An ingenious device. Good night, Batman Good night, Robin Good night, Batman I'm going to leave you now Ha-ha-ha! I don't understand. How could he have gotten away? Commissioner, we were half blinded by Minstrel's electronic flashes. Ah-ha! Ah. Apparently, we interrupted him before he could remove the last of these. You mean that tiny thing caused all the trouble? Yes. And there was one for each number's circuit of course. What is it? A heterodyning counter-oscillator would be my guess and a marvel of miniaturization. -Mm. To confuse the frequency. So each number has to come out anything but right. Commissioner, all Gotham City is in danger while this musical criminal is at large. He exhibits a degree of electronic sophistication far beyond anyone in the world today. He exhibits a degree of electronic sophistication far beyond that of anyone else in this world today. Except me of course. If, as I suspect, he spotted the counter-oscillators by now he knows the place was bugged. Smarter than you thought he was. You're absolutely right, my dear. He must be eliminated after all. We can count on him to come to us. All we have to do is be certain we're ready. Well, how do you mean you can count on him? He's waiting for me to go on the air again, Bass. So he can use our signal to lead him to us. So we'll work from the studio, not here. See that it's ready, Treble. But how can he use our signal? Unless he's a bird. The beam is so narrow, he can't even pick it up on the ground. He'll work out some way, you can bet on that. Fascinating bird, sir. What is it? It's a Batdrone plane, Alfred. We can direct it from here by remote control. Direct it? Yes, if the Minstrel goes on the air again and I suspect he will, if only to taunt me I think this bird should pick up his wavelength. - And locate his broadcasting studio. - Mm. There we are. Robin, let's test the drone. That could be the studio signal. Raise the level. That's it. Perfect. The Minstrel may be in for a surprise. I believe you're right, sir. Here comes the brazen fellow. I've offered the brokers a fair way out but as yet they haven't accepted that plan. In status that driven to mistrust and doubt they've turned for help to Robin and Batman. The audacity of it. Getting anything? The Batdrone's changed course. It's pick up the studio signal, all right. But I foiled the dauntless duo before. With nothing more startling than a spark and a flash. And though violence is something I strongly abhor I warned them that next time they'll land with a crash. -It's descending, Batman. -At what angle? - Eleven degrees, four minutes. -Eleven degrees, four minutes. Well, that should put the plane down somewhere over Gotham Park Lake. At the intersection of Willow and Fourth Street. There's nothing there, Batman. Except the old Willow Street Warehouse. That must be it. It's been a long night. It's going to be a big day. Let's get going. Alfred, bring the plane back. - Me, sir? -Yes. - Throw the Batdrone retriever switch. Oh! We can be expecting the Caped Crusaders any minute now. - This early, boss? -You can bet they've picked up the signal. They're on their way. Just be sure we're ready. Cameras all set, Treble? I just love suspense like this. Well, it's too bad, the suspense will soon be over, Octavia. Look, no door knobs. I know. This must be the place. And the broadcasting studio is probably on the top floor. Stand clear. Up we go. All right, men. Alert the boys in the storeroom and put Plan Low C into action. What a pity, Robin that a man of his musical talents, who could bring such pleasure to millions of people should pervert that genius to criminal antisocial ends. Especially when he could earn a good living from just records. - Look. That open window, shall we try it? -Yes, Robin. The opportunity well-taken is always a weapon of advantage. Be careful. It may be a trap. It is a trap. Pow! Wham! Look at the Dynamic Duo. They are efficient, aren't they? Do you think they'll win, Minstrel? Holy fly trap. You're making a mistake, Minstrel. With your genius, you could be a tremendous force for good in the world. Why waste it? I was regretting the necessity of doing away with you, Batman. A kindred genius, you know. But if there's anything I can't abide, it's a reformer. Activate the turnspit motor. Motor activated. In just a few minutes, gentlemen we'll be prepared to serve barbecued crusader if we have a call for it. You see, we've installed just beneath you, super units of a radar type grill. As you revolve, it can turn you from rare to medium to well done. Depending on the preference. Throw the switch. Switch is set. Holy hot spot, Batman. What can we do? Nothing, Boy Wonder. Nothing but cook. Are you sure this is a good idea, Minstrel? Good? It's perfect. Besides, my dear, there's no alternative. It's Batman or the Minstrel. The world isn't ready for both of us yet. Heh, heh. Batman and Robin Rotate and revolve As the heat grows Your bodies dissolve When it's still hotter Then you will melt Nothing left but your utility belt Is this it, Batman? Is this the end? If it is, Robin let's not lose our dignity. 
NARRATOR". So far we have seen, outside the Annual Gotham City Charity Luncheon a different kind of charity. And a different kind of hero. The Penguin. Penguin, a civic-minded citizen? Holy turnabouts, something's fishy. Mayor Lindseed, what was it? Penguin for mayor? He couldn't possibly win. Oh, yes, he could. Disaster for Gotham City. Only one hope. Batman for mayor. The Penguin campaign in high gear. Penguin posters everywhere. Batman discussed the issues to sympathetic supporters while Penguin issued champagne and other goodies. The Caped Candidate talked to the voters. But these voters wanted him out of the race. Robin, a political liability. Holy soap suds. An acid bath that could eat them clean to the bone. And a deadly set of scales. The waddling politico arrives to quack. Hang on for just one searing minute. In a few more seconds we're gonna be in the soup, Batman. It's all my fault, Robin. I should have recognized those goons as soon as I saw them. Well, here goes. Batman! Batman! - Batman, are you all right? -Yes, thanks to Alfred. Lucky he insisted on making these new costumes out of acid-proof material. Holy coffin nails, Batman, you sure had me scared. Just a second while I dissolve these thongs. Now to get you down from there, then we'll get out of here. Like them, Pengy? Never mind the buttons, Lulu. Batman is no longer with us. As of now it's a one-man race. - Then you should win it easily. -Hwah, hwah, hwah. That's very true. Thank you. Thank you. What? Hwah? Acid-proof costumes? Faugh. Faugh them. Well, he's not smear-proof. And when I get through with him on our TV debate even his own mother won't vote for him. This is ridiculous, Batman. Debating the Penguin on television when he tried to kill you not two hours ago. Unfortunately we have no proof. If I mention that, the Fair Campaign Practices Committee would accuse me of using smear tactics. I certainly wouldn't want that. You have to hold still, sir otherwise I shall be smearing the makeup on your cowl. Sorry, Alfred. There. You should look quite good under the lights now, sir. How do you do, ladies and gentlemen? Station KGOM is very happy and proud to bring you a debate between the candidates who are running for mayor of Gotham City. I believe the Penguin will lead off the debate. Friends and fellow citizens I wanna give you my solemn word that there will be no mud-slinging in this campaign unless, of course, my opponent slings it. But I intend to stick to the issues. Now, what are the issues? There is only one: Batman. Who is he? Who is this acrobatic clown who somersaults around Gotham City in that ridiculous costume? I suggest that behind that mask, Batman is in reality a dangerous criminal. Why else does he wear a mask? Why else does he conceal his past? Would you think about that a moment, my friends? Whenever you've seen Batman, who is he with? Criminals. That's who. You look in the old newspapers. Every picture of Batman shows him with thugs and with thieves and hobnobbing with crooks. Whereas my pictures show me always surrounded by whom? By the police. I am associate of the law. Listen to those lies. Oh, that Penguin, he's as crooked as a warped shillelagh. Now, which man do you want to run Gotham City? A man like myself, who is always in the company of the law or a man like Batman who rubs elbows with the worst elements of this city and who is undoubtedly a desperate criminal himself? Think about it without rancor, and remember this: No mud-slinging in this campaign. Yeah, Penguin, attaboy! Thank you very much. You bet. And now we should have a few words from the other candidate. My fellow citizens let me begin by pointing out some inconsistencies in both the logic and the substance of Mr. Penguin's preceding remarks. Vote Penguin, yes, sirree He's the vote for you and me Clean up Gotham, one, two, three What's going on? This is your doing, you waddling pat politician. Tut-tut, Wonder Midget. Can I help it if I have enthusiastic fans? Besides, now the voters won't be bored to death by Batman's babble. Hwah, hwah, hwah. We interrupt this broadcast for a special news flash. The Gotham City Convention Hall, containing $2 million worth of displays for the forthcoming Jewelers Convention is being robbed by a gang of criminals who have barricaded themselves inside Don't just stand there, get down to Convention Hall. Right, commissioner. We better get right down there, Robin. Why, you two incompetents will botch this job. Citizen Penguin to the rescue. This is Walter Klondike in the lobby of Gotham City's Convention Hall where one of the greatest robberies of all time is taking place right now. The two candidates for mayor have just gone inside to help subdue the cutthroat gang that has kept Gotham City's police force at bay. Oh, Chief O'Hara. Well, chief, how does it look to you now? Grim, that's how it looks. I only hope that Batman and Robin get out of there alive. - Mm. How about the Penguin? -Him? Why, that--! Thank you very much, Chief O'Hara. We now switch you to Chet Chumley inside Convention Hall. Come in, Chet. Thank you, Walter. This is Chet Chumley inside Convention Hall. From our post here high above the floor, we can see the battle spread before us. And Batman, Robin, and the Penguin are struggling furiously with the thugs who are attempting to make off with over a million dollars in jewels. Well, not so fakey, you fink. Not so real. Well, that's all for Robin. Just leaves the two candidates. Uh, we switch now to David Dooley down on the Convention floor. Come in, David. Thank you, Chet. This is David Dooley on the Convention floor. I'll to maneuver over to Batman to see if I can get him to say a few words to us. Is there anything at all you'd like to say to the television audience, Batman? Of course, Batman, a little bit later. Thank you. This is David Dooley on the Convention floor. I switch you back now to Chet Chumley. Take it away, Chet. Thank you, David. This is Chet Chumley high above the Convention floor. The battle is raging hot and heavy below us. Wait a minute. Batman got one. Now it looks like the Penguin is about to get one. He did. Score one more for the Penguin. Well, it looks like the Penguin is rolling up quite a lead. But it's still a tight contest. I think that, uh, David has maneuvered over toward the Penguin now so we switch to the Convention floor and David Dooley. Come in, David. Thank you, Chet. This is David Dooley on the Convention floor. I'm going to see now if we can get a few words from the other candidate. Is there anything you'd like to say to our audience? Though I'm very busy right now, David, as you can see bringing law and order back to Gotham City I always have a few words to say to the voters even when my own life is in danger. Where's the camera? Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Gotham City you've seen both of the candidates in action. And you can decide yourself which of us is better able to run this glorious city. You seem to be putting more thugs out of business than Batman. - How do you explain that? -Proves that I'm right. Batman is in cahoots with the criminal elements. - He's got one foot in the underground. -Thank you for your opinion, Penguin. - Mr. Penguin. - I'll teach you to defile our fair city. Penguin. - The Penguin. -The Penguin. What a man. What a man. The Penguin has certainly gained some political mileage today. Batman, are you all right? There were just too many for me, Robin. But somehow the Penguin was knocking them down left and right. That whole thing was a setup, Batman. That waddling weasel planned it. Perhaps, but I'm afraid we can't prove it. I guess nobody likes a loser. Well, that's the story from Convention Hall. - Good night, David. -Good night, Chet. It's a black day for Gotham City. - I just talked to Gallus, Rooper and Trendek. -How bad was it? The latest polls show That's gratitude for you. After all that Batman has done for our citizens. I think you underestimate the good citizens of Gotham City, chief. But look at the poll, Batman. Elections are not won by polls, commissioner. They're won by votes, at least in this country. Sixty-five percent is a big margin, Batman. I know it looks grim, Robin but I wouldn't throw in the towel until the votes are counted. Uh, the first returns should be coming in now. This is Walter Klondike. The first returns on the mayor's election have just come in. As usual, the northeastern precincts are reporting earliest. And the tally from the northeast gives the Penguin 12,574 and Batman 9682. - Hello? -Hello, commissioner. This is the next mayor of Gotham City speaking. What? Who is this? No, I just wanted to tell you not to worry about your job. See, I'm appointing the Riddler new commissioner of police and he's promised to give you back your old job. WW, you pompous-- Oh, that's pounding the beat on the waterfront. Why, you-- - Listen, you malignant-- -Oh, tut-tut. No harsh words, please. Commissioner, I'll put you in charge of cleaning sewers. - How dare you? -And you tell that Irish stooge of yours that his next job will be shining the shoes of the new police chief: The Joker. Terrible thing is, in a few short hours, that mangy bird may be my boss. Here's a new development, ladies and gentlemen. Although the eastern precincts went heavily for the Penguin the middle and western precincts show a very strong Batman trend. Western precincts? Batman is probably getting the Indian vote. Penguin's lead has narrowed to a few thousand, and continues to shrink. This election may still have some few surprises in it. You three blow-hards told me I couldn't lose. - What's happening? -The X factor. Random sampling error. Well, you better pray that my lead holds or you'll be taking random samplings of river water from the bottom. -It's too good to be true. -Shh. The returns. Here are the latest reports. The Batman trend is continuing. The western precincts have gone solidly for Batman. The Caped Candidate is now to within 1000 votes of the Penguin. You were the only one who really had faith in the voters, Batman. - I'm ashamed of myself. -We're all ashamed, Batman. We were ready to desert the ship, you never lost your courage. You brought us safely through. I never would've believed that the polls could be wrong. There have been other candidates who have trusted too much to the polls. And they found out that it's the votes that count. Smart politicians trust the voters, not the polls. After all, if you can't trust the voters, whom can you trust? Gotta win this election by hook or by crook. At least you have choices, Pengy. If you don't have a board of electors, you can't count the votes. And if you can't count the votes, you can't announce the winner. That s real sharp thinking. So hang the polls and hang the pollsters. I told you not to count those hobos down at the freight yards. What about the two sword swallowers and the lady wrestler you turned in? Nobody will ever listen to us again. Don't worry, we can always get a job rating TV Shows. - Ha, ha. We're going to win. -Saints be praised. You certainly taught me a few things about politics, Batman. Hello? Oh, just a minute. - For you. -Hello? The law says that the votes must be counted only by a duly appointed Board of Elections, Batman. And it so happens that I have the Board of Elections right here with me. All three of them. And unless the city council meets within one half an hour and proclaims me mayor of Gotham City they will be counting the votes in a morgue. You forget about the Bat-trace of Batman. I'm not gonna be on the phone long enough to let you trace the call. Good bye. The Penguin has kidnapped the Board of Elections, Mayor Lindseed. Holy potluck. No, Robin, not at all. Even the Penguin hasn't unlimited funds. I suspect the campaign has severely depleted his resources and he's holding his hostages in the headquarters of that venerable organization the Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks. Let's go. The half hour's up, and nothing from Batman. I think my little grandstand play has turned the tide. Turn the TV on again, Lulu. While we watch ex-mayor Hayseed or whatever his name is proclaim me mayor. Oh, I am gonna wring the city dry. I'm gonna pick the bones of Gotham City and throw the carcass to the finks. Aren't you being a little premature, Penguin? How'd you find this place? You goofed, that's how. And no good mayor ever goofs. Particularly when he hasn't even been elected yet. But I have the Board of Elections here. They can't have counted any more votes. They didn't need to. This is some sort of a trick, that's what it is. Some sort of a low, scurvy, underhanded, political sort of a trick. I'll have you reported to the Fair Campaign Practices Committee. No, PengY- You said we associated with criminals. So here we are. Attack. I thought you bought the machine to turn out your campaign literature, Pengy. Look what it's turning out now. I see it. And it's not literature. I'm getting out of here before they package me. - You'd better too. -No. Batman wouldn't dare touch me. Think what it would do to his public image. Remember, remember, I'm a candidate for the mayor of Gotham City. You lay hands on me, and I'll have the voters after you. Keep your distance. Keep your distance, I say. Keep your distance. I think it's time for us to wrap up the election. I take it you mean wrap up the candidate. Oh, exactly. Aah! Blast it, I'm a political candidate! Hwah, hwah, hwah. In case you're interested, Penguin Batman won the election by an overwhelming margin. The votes were already counted when you kidnapped the Board. Faugh, it's a fraud, I say. I demand a recount. Don't worry, you'll have another chance soon. The Convicts Committee for Clean Prison Government is having an election next week. You should arrive just in time to run for chairman. And if you need any endorsements, uh, just let us know. Hwah, hwah, hwah. I demand my constitutional rights. Hwah, hwah. Now that I've resigned in favor of Mayor Lindseed Gotham City will be back in good hands for another four years. And if nothing else, Robin got a good lesson in civics. Oh, I had enough experience to last me forever. You can never have too much experience in politics, Robin as many politicians have discovered. Yes? Why, yes, he's right here. - Batman, for you. -Thank you. Batman. Thank you very much. I'm flattered that your committee should be interested in me as a presidential candidate for 1968 but I'm afraid my Gotham City duties take precedence. Yes, I will definitely let you know if I change my mind. Well. Bulging ballot boxes, Batman, that was some offer. And you ain't even a general, Batman. Anyway, it was nice of them to call. Yes? Hold on, just a moment. Batman, another call. Yes, Batman. I'm flattered, gentlemen but I thought your party had a candidate for 1968. NARRATOR". Next week Mr. Freeze returns. 
It is midnight and Gotham City sleeps. But not everyone. . for there is evil afoot in the Gotham City art museum. What's that? Who's there? I know it was valuable. But why would they take only that and leave all those other magnificent treasures? I'm as puzzled as you are, commissioner. Uh, oh, Bonnie, come in, come in. Oddest looking man left this for you, sir, He said, it was important. Odd looking? In what way, Bonnie? I'm just not sure, commissioner, he was as jumpy as a cat. Thank you, thank you, Bonnie. A kitten. Look, there's a bit of paper under it's collar. Yes, newspaper clipping, what do you make of it O'Hara? What? Wait, that's Mark Andrews, the multi-millionaire. 'Owner of the stolen, golden cat. ' And look, one of them has been crossed out. And those two cats are only a small part of his priceless collection. Yes, now one was on loan to the museum and the other is at the Gotham City Exposition. I smell the tracks of a feline predator. - You mean? - Exactly. The Catwoman. I'm afraid this calls for more drastic methods. It's actually, quite rudimentary, Dick. You just have to think, Holy rachetskey! Gosh, Bruce. I think I'll just stick to Latin crossword puzzles. Ahem. Yes, Alfred. The phone, sir. Well, I didn't hear the phone. Oh, I. . I was just making a call, madam. Well, and there was someone on the line for Mr. Wayne. Oh, yes, that's happened to me too. We'll finish our snack later, Aunt Harriet. Yes, commissioner. 'Dreadful news, Catwoman is on the prowl again. ' We're on our way. To the bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Ta da da da Batman And we believe this is just the first of the planned robbery. Good thinking, commissioner. Obviously, the Catwoman would not be satisfied with only this. No, I'm certain this only the first stitch in the large tapestry of crime. And the clipping? There's a great deal of hidden significance in the fact that just one of the cats is scratched out. Gosh, I wish Mark Andrews, was here. I bet he could give us some more info. 'And indeed I can. ' 'Batman, we know that you would want Mr. Mark Andrews. ' 'We called him to come down to the headquarters. ' - How do you do, Mr. Andrews? - What a thrill this is, Batman. I've followed your exploits for years. Nice meeting you too, Robin. This clipping indicates that there are two golden cats. Yes, the second one is at the Gotham City Exposition. I wouldn't lend any one institution both cats at one time. Insurance, you know? Yes, I understand. How long will it be at the Exposition? Until this evening. If Catwoman is going to steal that one. - She'll do it tonight. - Correct, Robin. There's no time to lose. Will you wanting any extra police protection? No, thank you, Chief O'Hara. I certainly don't mean to cast any aspersions on the police department. 'This time I think. ' Robin and I better go at it alone. Any large contingent of police officers might create unnecessary confusion. Whatever you say, Batman. I know it'll be safe with you on the job. Let's go, Robin. It just doesn't sound right. Too easy is it, Robin? First, the cat at the museum. . then the cat at the Exposition. Thenthen. . The rest of Mark Andrew's collection. Holy trickery, you're right. But I don't understand why Catwoman wouldn't tell us what she's planning. Maybe to give us a false lead to hide the real crime. Robin, you haven't fastened your safety bat-belt. We're only going a couple of blocks. It won't be long until you're old enough to get a driver's license, Robin. Then you'll be able to drive the Batmobile and other vehicles. Remember, motorist's safety. Gosh, Batman when you put it that way. Meanwhile, in a quiet alley in the heart of downtown, Gotham City is a fur warehouse an innocent place of business. . or is it? What a beauty, I bet it's worth a small fortune. A fat lot of good that does is. She stole it but she won't sell it. Yeah, I wonder why. We should get our cut. Yours is not to reason why. Yours is to do as I tell you to. Or you'll keep tasting my cat o' nine tails. Leo, did you get the books? 'Yes, Catwoman. ' I had to go all the way down to the main library. But I got every one of them. Felix, what about the delivery? Smooth as cream, made it without a hitch. 'Good. ' I know that Batman and Robin will swallow the bait. And when they do. . I'll be rid of that dynamic duo once and for all. Others have tried but failed. The Catwoman is not like the others. I'll show you how to clip Batman and Robin's wings. I will prevail. Oh, joy success and revenge. All wrapped up into one sweet package. We're sorry, Catwoman, we didn't mean to step on your paws. Hmmdon't do it again. - Now where are the books? - I'll get them for you. Each of you know what you have to do, so do it. And remember this, once we get that other cat the key to untold riches will be ours. Yes, Catwoman. Good afternoon, sir. Trouble? The Catwoman has unsheathed her claws again. Oh, tsk itch. Will she never learn? Well the atomic reactor is recharging the Batmobile. Please help Robin with the auxiliary power channel. - Time is of the essence. - Yes, sir. All set on the auxiliary power channel. Good. Solution is ready. Increase the power to 17,000KW. Power is 17,000 KW. That's it. - All power off. - All power off. - Alfred. - Yes, sir. Please attach that high-pressure can to the outlet valve. There. That will neutralize the dangerous radioactivity and give us the proper amount of emission for our purposes. And may I enquire, sir, exactly what are your purposes? Of course, Alfred. It's a defense mechanism in case the Catwoman eludes us tonight and decides to make off with the prize. You see, we spray this radioactive mist on an object then we trace with the Bat-o-meter with in a radius of 50 miles. Remarkable. When dealing with powerful criminal elements one can never be too well prepared. Let's go. Batman and Robin, this way please. Thank you, citizens. No need for you to wait in line. You're on official business. I'd rather not say. There's no charge for you. Go right in. Well, I'd rather pay, just like any other ordinary citizen. - Yes. - 'They're here. ' - Excellent. - This place closes at six. One of the guys told me, they'll be at the Great Hall of Culture - 'and all alone. ' - Splendid. 'Is everything okay?' Purr-fect. Well, I for one, just don't like it, that's all. I mean, dealing with Batman and Robin. I don't know, it just makes me nervous. Everything makes you nervous. Well, I'd feel a lot better if I knew who he really was. The whole idea of a bat bothers me. That's exactly what I'd expect from you. Just enough time for a cat-nap. Felix, scram. And have the car parked at the corner at exactly 11, sharp. Right. There. Now we'll be able to trace the radioactivity within a 50 mile radius. Almost midnight. - Time to check the exits again. - I'll do it. No, Robin, you better let me do it this time. If you see or hear anything, let me know via bat-communicator. I'll be back in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Right. Holy cats, a cat. Help, Batman, help. What is it, Robin, answer me. A-ah. Poor little Robin Did the itty-bitty kitty ruffle your feathers? Din-ding-ding din-ding-ding You, feline devil. - What have you done with Robin? - Oh. Is that anyway to greet an old friend, Batman? Not even a "Hello, how are you?". Meow. Teach him some manners, fellas. 'Robin. Old chum. ' Come on, cats, let's get out of here. What happened? The cat. Easy now, Robin, you were drugged with cat-o-cor. A fiendish preparation designed to attack the central nervous system. Universal drug antidote pills will fix you up post-haste. Did you get the cat? Yes, Robin, it's just as I planned it. Now, the Catwoman will herself lead us to her lair and the recovery of both cats. Batman, the Bat-o-meter is functioning perfectly. All we do is follow the blip and we're on the trail. Of course I know, they're on our trail. They wouldn't be Batman and Robin if they weren't. Are we set to greet our two pigeons? They're going to get a "hello" they'll never forget. Good, just make sure nothing goes wrong. I wouldn't want to miss this opportunity. 'We're ready whenever you are, Catwoman. ' - Felix. - Yes, Catwoman. You can brush my pussy willows before you leave. 'And don't go against the fur. ' I'll treat them like they was my very own. This is it, Robin. She's in that building. How can you be sure, Batman? Look up, Robin, the sign on the door "Gato and Chat Fur Company. " Gato means cat in Spanish and Chat means cat in French. Only the Catwoman'd choose a hideout with those names. I'm glad you're upping your foreign languages, Robin. They come in handy when fighting crime. Si, si, Batman, what do we do now? There are no entrances and only one door, we have no choice. We'll use the Bat-beam and the Batmobile. Why don't we walk right in? That's the door, maybe booby-trap. We won't take any chances if we use the Bat-beam. Stand by for Bat-beam. You're right again, Batman, we might have been killed. Or worse. Now, let's go. The door. Seems, it would be more difficult getting out of here than it was getting in. 'Good evening, Batman and Robin. ' 'Welcome. ' Good evening, Catwoman. It seems as if you were expecting us. 'I have a wonderful night planned for you' 'and it starts right now. ' Where are we? 'You are deep in the inner catacombs of this building. ' 'This is the last room you will ever occupy. ' I've heard that song before, Catwoman. The last few bars are always the same. The criminal is always behind them. This is my night to howl, Batman. Because tonight you are the mice and I am the cat. The old cat and mouse game is it? 'You have a wonderful way with words, Batman. ' I couldn't have put it any better. How does it feel to be the quarry for a change, hmm? 'What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?' 'Alright, you've had your laugh, Catwoman. ' - Now what you intend to do is-- - 'Do?' Well. . First, I'm gonna give you, two a few pointers. Holy icepicks! What're we gonna do, Batman? 'Ticklish situation. Isn't it Batman?' Hit the deck, Robin, I'll get us out of this. These pointers are made of painted rubber, Robin. - The old cat and mouse game. - Exactly. 'But, it was scary for a while, wasn't it, Batman?' 'Meow. ' Your sense of humor leaves me cold, Catwoman. Felix. Perhaps, my next idea will warm you up, Batman. It's quite interesting. Almost, "cat-aclysmic". Evil is as evil does. 'Now you have to admit that was funny, Batman. ' Your childish antics lead me to believe you're a kitten not a cat. 'Leo' I'm bored with you, Batman. The time has come to separate Damon from Pythias. The cat-alogue is closed. Say goodbye to each other. 'Bye-bye, Robin. Your little bird has flown. ' What have you done with him? 'That's for me to know and you to find out. ' You, feline devil. Tsk tsk and another tsk, Batman. Why don't you just admit I'm smarter than you are and let it go at that? There's more than one way to skin a catwoman. 'Are you a betting man?' I never gamble. Well, this time you'll have to because I now have a wager you must accept. The stake's are your life. - You leave me no choice. - 'Ah, but I do. ' 'And that is the sum and substance of the bet. 'In front of you are two doors. ' 'I'm standing behind one of them. ' - And the other? - 'Ah, there's the rub. ' 'Behind the other door is a ferocious Batman eating tiger. ' - So, the odds are even. - 'Correct. ' 'If you pick the right door' 'I'm yours, Batman. ' 'If you pick the wrong door' 'you're mine. ' 'So, which is it, Batman' 'the lady' 'or the tiger?' 'The lady or the tiger?' Will Batman ever see Robin alive again? Will Robin ever see Batman alive again? Will our daring duo escape the claws of the wily Catwoman? The answer to these and many other terrifying questions tomorrow night, same cat time same cat channel. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Ta-da-da-da da-da da-da da Batman 
NARRATOR". When last we saw our beleaguered battlers they were slowly sinking in a bitter batter of Riddler quicksand. A grim and gritty end awaits them unless something awfully good happens awfully fast. Holy Titanic, Batman. We're going down for the last time. Don't be a pessimist, Robin. Many of those who survived that tragedy did so by remaining calm and treading water until help arrived. -But this is quicksand. I know, Robin. But I seem to recall a recent report on jungle survival which indicated that many victims of quicksand are victims because of their own panic. -Not doing a lot for my nerves. The specific gravity of quicksand approximates that of water. If we remain calm and motionless we shouldn't sink much farther than your lower lip. -It's working, Batman. -Yes. One thing worries me, though, how long can we keep floating? We won't have to float long, old churn. If our experimental Heel-and-toe Bat-rockets perform as well as they should. Experimental Heel-and-toe Bat-rockets? Haven't been tested yet. Let's not put off till tomorrow what we can do today, Robin. As I begin the countdown slowly reach for the Heel-and-toe Bat-rocket controls in your utility belt. Remember, any sudden movement will disturb our equilibrium, and we can't afford to sink much further. Now, on the count of zero activate your Bat-rockets. -Roger. Zero minus five zero minus four zero minus three zero minus two zero minus one. Zero. NARRATOR". Later at the Riddler's hideout in the soon to be opened Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory the magic of electronics provides the Riddler and his band of malevolent yeoman with a fascinating account of their latest criminal coup. All of Gotham City is aghast today at the daring daylight robbery in Gotham City Square Park in which $1 million of charity funds accumulated in Batman's honor was snatched from the hands of the poor by the light-fingered Riddler. - Light-fingered? - He and his henchmen Yes, that's what I am. Light-fingered, nimble, quick. Wonderful. In a joint statement issued just minutes ago Commissioner Gordon and Batman and Robin promised an intensified search for the perpetrators of this shameless crime and the speedy recovery of the charity funds. The following riddle left at the scene of the crime provides their only clue. "When is an eagle's nest blessed best?" That mealy-mouth faker. Issued a joint statement with Batman and Robin, did he? Well, he knows and we know that the Caped Crusaders are defunct, departed, demised, dead. What if he isn't lying? - What if Batman and Robin are--? -Alive? Impossible, dear Anna Gram. Even if it were possible, it couldn't matter less. One more cunning caper and I'll have the prize of Professor Charm's demolecularizer. Then let them send the regiment of Batmen against me. When is an eagle's nest blessed best? Seems to me that any nest is most blessed when there are little ones in it. - Yes. -Or nest eggs. - Riddler is after a nest egg. -Which leads me to speculate that he intends to strike an eagle's nest somewhere here in Gotham City. - Do you agree, Robin? -I agree. But there hasn't been an eagle in Gotham City in 75 years. Except in a zoo. Perhaps not, Chief O'Hara but I know of at least one eagle's nest. Where's that, Batman? A nightclub. High atop the Gotham City State Building known as the Aerie. Of course, the Aerie or eagle's nest. A favorite watering place for Gotham City's elite. And a perfect target for an aquiline attack. Aquiline. That's a very descriptive word, Commissioner Gordon. - Are you acquainted with its etymology, Robin? -Aquiline. Of or like an eagle. - From aquila, Latin for eagle. -Yes. And what Latin eagle now lives, resides or nests here in Gotham City? Anthony Aquila, the exiled dictator from South America. And a multimillionaire who's rumored to keep at least $1 million in cash in his wall safe at all times. That must be it, Batman. How could the Riddler resist such a treasure. There's treasure at both ends of the rainbow, commissioner. While Robin and I dash to Anthony Aquila's palatial penthouse apartment you and your men in blue protect the area. An ingenious tactic. Thank you, commissioner. And good luck to all of us. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in Anthony Aquila's palatial penthouse reproduction of his former plantation home the Riddler and his bearers lurk in the underbrush. Ha, ha. There it is, you nearsighted nitwits. The answer to a hard heart's dream. Don't stand there staring at it. The loot sack, knaves. Ha. Fill it. Quickly. Riddler, come out of the bush and surrender. As a duly deputized peace officer I order you to drop that sack and give yourself up. Impossible. Fifteen feet of lethal quicksand. They sure don't look defunct to me, Riddler. Or demised, departed and dead. How? - How did they survive? -Right was on our side, that's how. Get them. - The loot sack, Riddler. -And then we'll talk about the money you took from the poor and needy. -No, we don't, Boy Wonder. Because you and your deputized friend are going to watch me walk out of here. Follow me and I'll show you why. At ease, old chum. I suspect Riddler's prisoner is Senor Aquila himself. Brilliant deduction. Hold this. Yes, the eagle himself caged like a big bird. And, Batman, his life is in your hands. Thank you. I prepared this tricky cage in case the news report was true and you two showed up. In mere moments, an explosive charge inside that ticking green box will send Senor Aquila and his palatial penthouse higher than any eagle has ever flown. - Unless? -Unless you and junior here unlock the secret to these battling bars and disarm the bomb in time. Well, adios, amigos. Better get to work. Ta-ta. Are we going to let them walk out just like that? We have no choice, Robin. Senor Aquila has many friends in his home and we cannot risk an international incident. I suppose you're right. This particular puzzle cage doesn't seem to conform with the usual puzzle cage pattern. Some of the medieval puzzle cages were designed so that all the intersecting rods were dependent upon the access of only one supporting rod. Disengaging that one rod unlocks the entire cage. -Stand clear, Robin. Curious, but decidedly an explosive. "To whom it may concern. If the tail fits, wear it. " There you are, professor. Three million dollars. I must admit, Mr. Riddler, you are a man of your word. Where do we go to pick up the demolecularizer? Oh, I have it with me at all times. - This is the demolecularizer? -Mm-hm. You want me to pay $3 million for an 89-cent pencil flashlight? That 89 cents pencil flashlight, as you call it, Mr. Riddler is, in reality, a highly sophisticated weapon which took a lifetime to develop. Powerful enough to disrupt the molecular structure of matter yet so simply designed that it can be recharged by plugging it in any household electrical outlet. How does it work? Um Watch that, uh, green derby on that chair over there. Wow. It's gone. Disappeared. - That thing really works. -As I said it would. Make it come back now. It isn't yet possible. I haven't even began work on the molecular storer for lack of funds. Well, now you have $3 million and I have Gotham City right by the throat. Get Commissioner Gordon on the phone. He should be the first to know. Another crisis, commissioner? A rather enigmatic phone call from the Riddler. Suggesting that we keep our eye on Marshall Coley's statue. Do you think he would dare desecrate the statue of our revered war hero right here in Coley Square? A life of crime has worn the Riddler's moral fiber to a frayed strand, commissioner. He may have little respect for the memory of the great Marshall Coley. - This could be another of Riddler's ruses. -Quite true, Robin. Holy Houdini. Great slithering snakes. The Marshall, he's gone. Uncanny. Careful, Chief O'Hara. Whatever unknown force was employed in dematerializing Marshall Coley's statue may have left a contaminating residue on the pedestal. Begorra, you're right. Thanks, Caped Crusader. Someone here called "Batman"? Yes. I'm Batman. Telegram. Another Riddler-gram. It's an ultimatum. "Unless Gotham City is declared an open city and all criminal statutes rescinded within two hours police headquarters will disappear as surely and as quickly as Marshall Coley's statue. " That swaggering peacock. Oh, he's only bluffing. I'm afraid not, chief. Listen to this. "If the city fathers refuse to capitulate after police headquarters is gone building after building will disappear until they do. " To confound us further, the telegram ends with a riddle. "What is it that travels on all fours in the morning on two legs at noon, and three at twilight? If you intend to follow me, add the answer to the other three. " What can we do, Batman? It saddens me, commissioner but I just don't know. Gosh, Batman. I'm sure hung-up on this riddle. I'll help you just as soon as I collate these figures for the remote Bat Computer. Now, if my original premise was correct and that machine has done a man's job Man's job. Man's job. Man. That's it, Batman. Man travels on all fours in the morning of his life or as an infant. And on two legs at noon or as an adult. And with a cane or three legs in the twilight of his life. Congratulations, Robin. Now let's concentrate on the last part of Riddler's challenge. "If you intend to follow me, add the answer to the other three. " We'll select the keywords from each of the first three riddles. Page, banquet eagle's nest and man. For instance, the letter P in the word "page" is the 16th letter in the alphabet. Using numerical positions in the alphabet as a common denominator we then add the number two for banquet and five for eagles-- And 13 for man. And the total? - Thirty-six. -Thirty-six. Thirty-six inches in a yard or three feet. And who has three feet to you? No one. Or no man. I seem to recall a recent announcement of a factory opening by that name. Robin, activate the remote Bat Computer again. "Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory. " - On the corner of Shady Glade and Fifth. -Excellent. - Commissioner? -Yes, Batman. Could you arrange for the immediate delivery of four 100-pound sacks of sodium dichloride to the Batcopter? I'll explain later. Consider it done. Anything else? Yes. Do not, I repeat, do not capitulate to any of Riddler's demands until you hear from me under any circumstances. You have my word on that too, Batman. Good. What are we gonna do with four 100-pound sacks of sodium dichloride, Batman? Checkmate Riddler. Hopefully. NARRATOR". While the Caped Crusaders race against approaching doom their impatient adversary frets away the remaining minutes. How can you lamebrains play cards in a time like this? Oh, gee, Riddler. Honey, what else is there to do? Turn the television on. That fatheaded police commissioner has little less than half an hour before he starts looking for a new headquarters. Chief O'Hara, I'm Bud Furillo of the Gotham City Herald. Is there anything I can tell my readers about your investigation? Well, we've moved every piece of furniture in this building. We've looked under very rug, but nothing could be found. What is it that you and your elite squad are looking for? Well, we don't exactly know. But we'll keep right on looking till the very last second. BUD". Thank you, chief. Poor Chief O'Hara, knocking himself out looking all over the building for the demolecularizer when it's hidden in the commissioner's office. - It is? -When did you manage to do that? On my way back from Marshall Coley Square I plugged it into an ordinary electrical outlet behind the commissioner's couch. If the commissioner follows my instructions and issues a capitulation proclamation in precisely 4:55 p. m I'll call him and tell him how to deactivate the automatic trigger. - How? -Simple. Turn the wall switch to the off position. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, the Dynamic Duo wings across the city with their cargo of sodium dichloride. The moment is almost at hand now when the city must announce its decision. Capitulation will amount to official sanction of wanton lawlessness. Standing fast will prompt unholy destruction. We understand that Commissioner Gordon has refused to leave the building. Wonderful. Let him go down with his building. There's very little time left now. No time to use the stairs. We'll have to try the Bat-rope. Stand clear. MAN". Our telephoto lens is providing the view of police headquarters which you see on your screen. Except for Commissioner Gordon Chief O'Hara and his elite bomb squad, the building is empty. All we can do is watch and wait. Watch and wait, Gotham City. There's more to come. As the seconds tick away the clouds above police headquarters seemed to be darkening as though a storm were imminent. Just five seconds to go. Four three, two one. - What happened? -The demolecularizer. It didn't work. I knew it was a cheap flashlight. Flashlight. Flashlight! - Try again. -Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with electricity? -You two, how did you do it? The supercharged electrical power of that lightning neutralized the effect of your weapon. How did you know the lightning would strike at the right time? We arranged for it. Cloud seeding. With 400 pounds of sodium dichloride. Fortunately, my calculations proved correct. As usual, your riddles led us right to you. You've made the mistake of being predictable yourselves with your legendary window entrances. Riddle me this. When is a floor like a puzzle? Help! Batman! - Nice catch, chief. -Let go of me, you blue-footed baboon. I'll bet she's the toughest one of the bunch. - She's the only one still kicking. -Ow! Coming forward voluntarily with the stolen charity money should tip the scales of justice in your favor, professor. No man can live with the wails of the hungry children in his conscience. Professor, when you've paid your debt to society you'll be able to continue your scientific studies under the wing of the Gotham City Science Institute. I don't know how to thank you, Batman for arranging my membership. -You can thank our friend Bruce Wayne. Mr. Wayne persuaded the membership to lower the customary educational requirements. Robin, we should take this money to the Wayne Foundation before the close of business hours. -Roger. Amazing man. Do you know who is under that mask of his? To ask, professor, who he is is nowhere near as important as where he is at all times. 
NARRATOR". Sunday afternoon in Gotham City. A day of rest for everyone, including crime-fighters. . . or so it seems. I was very glad that you could accompany me to the accordion recital this afternoon, Barbara. There's nothing I like better than hearing "Lady of Spain" played eight times. That is beautiful. Daddy's been wanting us to get better acquainted for some time now. Indeed. Mm. Time passes very swiftly with pleasant company. Would you like to watch the television news broadcast together? That's why the shades are drawn, isn't it? And on a local front, this news is happening now. The anonymous informant who has correctly predicted two prior robberies has added a third. And this station now knows who that informant is. For that live story, we switch controls to Mobile Unit Number 7. Ah! Hello out there in television land. This is King Tut speaking with yet another prediction of a crime to come. The police, those sometime guardians of your life and property have chosen to ignore my prior prognostications and the results were two successful criminal actions. Heh. With that in mind, here is my third prognostication. Andrew's Hockey Puck Factory on West 20th will be robbed before I finish my next sentence. Yes, commissioner. He's not in, but I can get him in a hurry. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Be right there. What's that? Oh, it's my wristwatch alarm. I'm sorry, Barbara, I'd forgotten I have a meeting at the Wayne Foundation later today. Oh, don't mention it. Business before pleasure. Oh, but you might drop me at my beauty salon. It's right around the corner. Thanks, Alfred. Goodbye, Bruce. Dick, Bruce here. Commissioner Gordon called. Our friend the Yale professor was hit by a brick at a love-in. He's become King Tut again and apparently he's up to some nefarious scheme. Where is the scoundrel currently situated? Well, he set up shop in a tent in a vacant lot at the corner of 6th and Albert. I've been informed he intends predicting another crime this afternoon. Let's go, Robin. The longer we tarry, the more dire the peril. NARRATOR". Shortly thereafter in King Tut's current habitat the scurrilous scalawag is plying his newfound trade to an interested assemblage. Oh, mystical, magical Prince of Darkness . "ooh,hoo". I invoke your name and call upon your spirit. I beseech you to tell me the time and place of the next robbery. - In the name of everything that's nasty -Pardon me. give me your answer, do. Ladies and gentlemen here is my next prediction. Come off it, Tut. Your predictions are nothing but phony, fatuous flimflam. Who dares impugn the veracity of Tut Nabob of the Nile, Moon God of Thoth, and stuff like that? By the instep of Ramses, I'll have his head! This is all part of some dastardly trick, Tut. Why don't you come with me and let us have your head examined? Stand back, you Caped Crumbum. I'm now on your side of the law now. I'll bet you are. He is. He's on all sides of the law. What is going to happen, Tut? In less than one hour the box office at the Soccer Stadium will be robbed. As a citizen of Gotham City, I would like to see that crime thwarted. This town can be a better, safer place to live. I just love better, safer places to live. Ha! Whether or not you care to act on this information is of little consequence, my Dynamic Dum-Dums. I have cleared my conscience by reporting to the law. The rest is up to you. - Let's go, Robin. -You mean you really believe him? Robin, the Constitution provides that a man is innocent until proven guilty. And the Constitution is the cornerstone of our great nation. We must abide by it. Gosh, when you put it that way, Batman, how can I help but agree? Excuse me. Good day. All right, crime fans, that's all for today. Come back tomorrow for some brand-new predictions. Ah! Wasn't I magnificent? Again. Ha, ha. Shirley, fan me. Oh, I am, Tutsy-poo. These feathers sure came from a heavy ostrich. Osiris, I want some fruit. Nubis, peel it. You still haven't told us what your plans are. Prime your ears. Your fabulous pharaoh has given all this free information to the police in order to worm his way into their confidence. When the propitious moment arises, I'll send them on a wild flamingo chase whilst I commit the crime of the century. Toast it. Give up without a struggle, we'll make things easier for you. If not, you may be severely pummeled about the head and shoulders. Hello, Robin. A nice bracelet for you. And a little something for you, Batman. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent idle bystander is neither innocent nor idle. Congratulations. We heard about the skirmish and rushed right over. Your timing, as usual, is flawless, commissioner. Only a little more time, vassals. A bit of watchful waiting. That little blip is the Batmobile. When it disappears, the Dynamic Dingbats will have gone into the Batcave. And as soon as that happens, we'll know exactly where that accursed place is and have a direct line on their true identities. Ah! It's disappeared. Quickly, coordinates. - Forty degrees longitude - Longitude. - 12 minutes north. - Twelve, north. - Forty-three degrees latitude - Three in the-- eight minutes east. East. Carry the four. Ha! Oh, I'll be a son of a Byzantine king. - Do you know where that is? -The zoo? The Batcave is directly under stately Wayne Manor. That means that Bruce Wayne and Batman are the same and one. - Where's Alfred? -He's probably out shopping. Today is market day and he likes to take advantage of the specials. Hello. Hello, Batman. This is your monarch speaking. King Tut, and he asked for Batman. Holy heart failure. You have the wrong number. There's no one here by that name. Come off it, you Caped Cockamamie. Give it to him, Tutsy. You've got him by the cowl now. Ha, ha. Be a good sport, Batman. Admit you've been outwitted. My name is Bruce Wayne and you're calling my residence. - Now will you please--? -Of course, you're Bruce Wayne. You're also Batman. And Tut's gonna tell it to the whole world at a press conference tomorrow. Aren't you, sweetheart? Yes, indeed, my little delta lotus. Batman will make you look like a fool. He and I have met, but that's the extent of our relationship. Balderdash, say I. Stuff and nonsense and phooey. The only way you'll convince me that Batman and Bruce Wayne are not the same person is let me see them both simultaneously. Or both at the same time, whichever comes first. NARRATOR". In the Batcave the Caped Crusaders discover the cause of their dire dilemma. What happened? Ah-ha. I'm afraid we've been bugged, Robin. Of course, he's probably the best-known Egyptologist in his field. Unfortunately he was hit by a-- accuse. Poor deluded man. Ladies and gentlemen of Gotham City I put it to you that Bruce Wayne millionaire playboy and man-about-town is none other than the one the only the original Batman. I sincerely appreciate the compliment, King Tut. I'm not so sure whether Batman would. Why don't you tell him? He's just outside. It'd be quite a joke on me, Charlie, if Batman really were Bruce Wayne. Perhaps if I move closer -the question might be more easily resolved. -it's a trick. It's a trick. As you can see, we don't look a bit alike, do we, Batman? Not a bit, Mr. Wayne. Not a bit. He's not-- He's-- He's fake. Fake. Tut, why don't you forego this foolishness and submit yourself for observation? Once rehabilitated, I'm sure you will become a valuable member of the community. He's Batman, all right. Who else in this present-day dynasty could be that square? Goodbye, everybody. Robin and I must pursue our relentless war against evil. - Goodbye, Batman. -Anyhow, you have to admit it, Charlie the chance of Bruce Wayne being Batman was a very long shot. I can't think of two more obviously opposite people. Agh. It is written: "He who knows he has lost has had it. " Goodbye, Mr. Wayne. - Goodbye, Tut. -Yes. Thank you, folks. That masked moralist thinks he has me, does he? He'll soon learn he can't escape the wrath of the sun king. We now swing into phase two of our operation. - Which is? -Purloining the priceless collection of Egyptian scrolls nestled in the Gotham City Library. - Ha-ha-ha! -Scrolls? I thought it was something good, like crocodile skins or jeweled scorpions. Button your lip, my little desert partridge. I said they were priceless, didn't I? For hidden somewhere within them is the secret of the whereabouts of a statue hidden since the age of lmhotep. So, what's with the statue? The great golden statue of the god Osorkon. Whoever possesses it, my AswÃ¢n damsel, possesses the universe. That's a lot of land. Mama told me to pick a nice Egyptian girl. Hmph. Wow, you came down that pole like a pro, Alfred. I bet you always wanted to do that. Indeed I have, Master Robin, but once is enough. Next time I'll use the elevator and leave the Batpoles to you. Any problem with the ersatz Batman, Robin? - Holy Gemini, it worked great. -it's the same principle as a dummy, Alfred. I used my pocket Bat-synchronizer to operate the lips, throw in a bit of ventriloquism. No one was the wiser. Batmobile drove itself after being programmed to stop at red lights and intersections. Was that ever a weird experience. Alfred, would you put my twin brother in the Bat-Dummy closet please? Very good sir. - Yes, commissioner? -King Tut has predicted another crime. - The charlatan. -He insists all available police surround Gotham City Penitentiary as a massive escape is in the offing. Certain forces will attempt to spring Penguin, Riddler, Egghead, and the Siren. Get your men out there. We can't afford to take chances. But that means the remainder of Gotham City is wide-open for evildoers. Robin and I will protect the balance of the populace. Eight million people? - Trust me. -Of course, Batman. Get all your men up to Gotham City Penitentiary at once. Shouldn't we leave a skeleton force, commissioner? Batman suggested it. Charlie, did you hear what King Tut said? Well, it was something very interesting. If the quote he quoted is the quote I think he quoted I may just have figured out Tut's entire plot. It was a mistake only an Egyptian bibliophile would have noticed. Lucky I'm an Egyptian bibliophile. NARRATOR". Luckily for us, she's an Egyptian bibliophile. And even luckier, she's Batgirl the supremely feminine scourge of all that is criminal. Did you believe that prediction? Say it isn't so. I take whatever Tut says with a ton of salt, Robin. But there was something he said which may be a key to his ultimate caper. He said it to Bruce Wayne. It had something to do with a quote of some sort. - I was in the Batmobile at that time. -Oh, yes, I remember, sir. What's it all about, Alfred? It was to the effect that a man who knows when he has lost has had it. "Had it. " Of course, it's staring us right in our masks, Robin. That quote is on line 769 of chapter 14, scroll 32 of the 13th section of the works of Ramses the Bold. One of the many ancient and irreplaceable scrolls at the Gotham City Library. How could I have missed that one? And with Gotham City's police out of the way, he thought he'd have clear sailing. Let's go, Robin, and let's hope we're not too late. The Gotham City Library closed five minutes ago. We can still catch them. Robin, look out. This librarian has been bound in the ancient thuggee tradition. She won't live a minute longer in that position, Robin. And when faced with the prospect of choosing between the apprehension of a criminal and the saving of a human life, one must always save the life. Gosh, Batman, you're right again. - What happened? -That big hulking brute raced in here and stole our most expensive scrolls. All the police that usually guard the library were ordered out on another job. They said you'd protect us, Batman. Don't worry. We'll get those scrolls back. - Doesn't Barbara Gordon work in this library? -Today is her first day off in a month. Batman, you've just got to get those scrolls back. They are ancient and irreplaceable. Yes, I know, my dear. Let's go, Robin. Frankly, Batman, I'm stumped. Perhaps a clue will turn up. Ooh, Tutlings, we have performed the most marvelous theft. The golden statue of Osorkon is almost within our grasp. Osiris, Nubis, gather up these scrolls and let's make tracks. The only tracks you'll be making are straight to the penitentiary. - Batgirl. -In the flesh. You know, it's against my principles to beat up on ladies but in your case, I'll make an exception. Get her. Agh. How did you figure out my plan? Simple. I recognized a quote from the works of Ramses the Bold and realized then it was the scrolls you were after. I got to the library as you escaped and followed you here. You know, I can always use a smart girl in my line of work. The ones I've had lately are rather inferior. Would you, uh? I'm afraid not. Batman and Robin will be here momentarily. I blazed a trail for them. Consider your criminal career kaput. Well, heh. Goodbye, Batgirl. You're not going anywhere. No, but you are. To dreamland. Defeated by a mere wisp of a girl. Now, for the second time, let's make tracks. The only tracks you'll make are to the penitentiary. There's some sort of delayed echo in here. As a duly deputized officer of the law, it's my duty to advise you of your rights. You'll have to catch me first. Get him, get him, get him. - So it was you who blazed the trail. -I was just doing my duty as a citizen. I like that kind of talk. Perhaps we could get together some evening and discuss crime-fighting techniques. No one knows where you live. Yes, that does constitute somewhat of a problem. Look out. Here they come again. Batgirl never stays around long enough for us to thank her. She's probably very modest. I wonder who she really is. I wonder who he really is. I'm afraid it will be a long siege of analysis before you realize who you actually are. I've lived a thousand years, so I'll live another thousand. - Hi, Daddy. Hello, Bruce. -Hi. Good to see you again, Barbara. I wonder if we could, um, continue that date we interrupted this weekend. Hey, you mean you actually had a date with this socialite lump? Yes. Why? Because he's so deadly dull. Deadly dull, that's what it is. Just deadly dull in Gotham City. What did I say? Deadly dull? Yes. What? You don't say. You don't say. You don't say. - Who was it? -Who was it? He didn't say. What his name was, that is. But it was the patrolman at the corner of Plat and Green Street. And he just saw that notorious gangster Louie the Lilac drive by in his Flowermobile. Well, that's my cue to leave. Yeah! Ha-ha-ha! That's what I said! He's gonna go straight to the Batcave and put on that corny blue outfit. Actually, I had something more mundane in mind, King Tut. I've had so much crime in the last two days, I don't care if I ever see it again. - Goodbye, Barbara. -Bye. Commissioner Gordon. Bye, Bruce. Nice young man, isn't he? I think I'm gonna be sick. Bruce Wayne's nice enough, Daddy. But he's certainly no Batman. You wanna wager a sphinx or two? Commissioner, weren't you gonna call somebody? Was I? Ah, uh, Batman. 
NARRATOR". When last we saw the Caped Crusader he was at the altar about to be married to the diabolical Marsha, Queen of Diamonds. Only the words "I do" stand between him and the bonds of wedlock. l. l. Say "I do. " - I - Stop the wedding. This is no time for pranks, my good man. We are in the midst of a sacred ceremony. I assure you, sir, this is no prank. Who are you? Ethelbert Soames, solicitor at law with the firm of Soames, Stillwell and Thistlewaite Liverpool, England. My card. My card. My card. - What has this to do with the wedding? -Allow me to present my client. Formerly Miss Henrietta Tillitson of Morton in the Marsh, Gloucestershire. What do you mean "formerly"? I mean that for the last seven years, she has been Mrs. Batman. Mrs. Batman? Yes. If you'd care to examine the wedding certificate. Duly attested by the registrar at Morton in the Marsh and, uh, dated seven years ago. Why didn't you tell me about this, Batman? - Eh, uh-- It slipped my mind. -Slipped your mind, indeed. I am not in the practice of marrying bigamists. Why, you two-timing Batfink! How dare you leave a poor, defenseless girl waiting at the altar? Not poor, I hope, madam. We are instituting a lawsuit for $1 million for the alienation of the husband's affections. Ah! Let's get out of here. Mrs. Cooper. Why, I wasn't sure you'd remember me, Batman. Of course I remember you. I've always treasured our brief meetings. And I certainly wanna thank you for the help you gave me here today. Oh, I'm glad. I was afraid you'd be angry with us for stretching the truth the way we did. Not under the circumstances, believe me. If we can be of any further service, sir. - As a matter of fact, Mr -Alfred will do, sir. As a matter of fact, Alfred, yes. Robin is out of commission, I'd appreciate it if you would accompany me in the Batmobile. Certainly, sir. I've always wanted to ride in that ingenious vehicle. Good. Again my thanks, Mrs. Cooper. You were truly superb. Oh, Bruce will never believe it when I tell him. We'll have to get to Robin as soon as possible. We'll have to drive it as it is. Anticipating an emergency, sir, I've brought along a kit of Bat Antidotes. Good thinking, Alfred. Incidentally, I forged the marriage certificate on the Bat Printer. A remarkable invention of yours, if I may say so. Yes, it did the job this time. The sleep potion I gave before the wedding is still in effect. Good. Pump another potion into Boy Wonder there and he'll worship me forever. Then I'll make him lead me to the Batcave, and the Bat Diamond will be mine. Hurry, hurry! Before that Bat Bigamist partner of his shows up. Yes, Your Highness. Where are my Guardians? They were held up in traffic, Your Highness. Forget the Boy Wonder. Out this door. Never mind about them, Alfred. Our first concern is Robin. Quickly! The Bat Antidotes. We'll use the general all-purpose Bat Antidote and hope that it takes effect. Robin. Robin. It looks like it's working, Alfred. What happened, Batman? How did I get in here? It's a long story, Robin. I'll explain later. Alfred, give Chief O'Hara and the commissioner each one of those tablets. - Tell the commissioner to meet me at the office. -Yes, sir. - Think you can make it, Robin? -I think so. - I feel woozy. -I know. We'll take you to the Batcave where you can get some rest. And we can try to deduce the Queen of Diamonds' next move. She'll stop at nothing to get her hands on the Bat Diamond. Can't an old lady take a bath without being interrupted? Your potion failed, darling. Miserably. A good hot bath does wonders for the arthritis. Please, darling, pay attention when I'm talking to you. What is it, deary? The potion? Oh, yes. Well, I knew it wouldn't work. Those newts I've been getting lately are very poor quality. Well, you're going to have to think of something else. I have to get inside that Batcave. I've been in dozens of bat caves, deary. They're very dull. This is a very special Batcave. Take it from me, when you've seen one bat cave, you've seen them all. Suppose you let me worry about that. You're going to have to think of something to put those caped clowns in my power. Oh, all right, darling. All right. Fetch me my recipe book. It's over there. Is this the one? Is there a buzzard's tongue lying next to it? Yes. Ew. Then that's the one, deary. Ah. How about a potion to make them vanish? No, no, no, darling. I want them to lead me to the Batcave and the Bat Diamond. Just put them in my power. Here's a nice little potion that turns them into tigers. Too large, darling. Mosquitoes? - Too small, darling. -Ha-ha-ha. Here's an old potion I haven't used in years. It turns them into nice fuzzy little rabbits. That's the one. Unless, of course, they have type-O blood in which case it turns them into giant boa constrictors. Find another potion, darling. The Bat Diamond. What about it, Robin? To think it's the cause of all this trouble. People call it many different things, old chum. Passion, lust, desire, avarice. But the simplest and most understandable word is "greed. " Why would Marsha want that particular diamond? She can't wear it. You can't wear Michelangelos. You can't wear vintage cars or old stamps or coins. But to certain collectors, they're a way of life. In fact, life itself. Cars and stamps and coins I can understand. But where would she find a place to put that diamond of that size? That's an academic question, Robin. She's not going to get it. Gosh, I hope not. When you got me out of that bird cage, you said it was a long story and you'd explain it later. Just what happened? To you? The same thing that happened to me. A cupid's dart. I felt it. But she said it wasn't poisoned. Probably not in the true sense of the word "poison" but certainly it contained some secret ingredient by which your sense and your will were affected. We were shot by the same type of dart and it didn't affect you the same way. Oh, it did, Robin. it did. I just called on all my resources to combat it. I called on all mine too, but all of a sudden, there I was on my knees, worshiping her. Oh, it's merely the difference of a few years, old chum. An older head can't be put on younger shoulders. Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara have older heads, look what happened to them. Yes, I know. It wasn't pretty. But first things first. If you're back in fighting form, let's have a go at the Batcomputer. Instead of Marsha finding the Bat Diamond perhaps the Bat Diamond can lead us to Marsha. We know she's surrounded by diamonds, and perhaps if we set the Batradar at the emanating frequency of diamonds we could calculate the reflection pattern of the diamonds. Make them show up on the Batradar screen and then figure out the coordinates. Right. All set, Batman. What are the numbers? Got it, Batman. The coordinates are four, six, seven and nine, eight, one. Four, six, seven. Nine, eight, one. Elevation? Holy stalactites, Batman. The elevation is minus 80. Minus 80. - Just as I thought. -Where is it? Yes? -It's good to hear your voice, commissioner. -And yours, Batman. If it hadn't been for you, the chief and I would be singing love songs to that woman. And if it hadn't been for that resourceful citizen who saved me at the altar I'd be on my honeymoon right now. I'd like to send that wretched creature on a honeymoon to state prison. And I think I know where she is. It wouldn't be that basement of the building we were in, would it? Why, yes. She made a remark about visiting her aunt there. But how could you possibly know? Occasionally, we men come up with a few tricks too, commissioner. Robin and I are on our way there. Be careful, Batman. She may be waiting for you. Don't worry, commissioner. We'll be ready for her. There is no mystery that man can't solve. Be careful, Batman. There are some mysteries no man can solve. As Batman said, if it hadn't been for you, he'd be on his honeymoon right now. The Caped Crusader is too kind. After all, I only did what any citizen of Gotham City would have done. And lucky you did, sir. Yes. Good thinking, and very inventive, I might add. Producing a past wife of Batman's who never existed. Ha, ha. Oh, but she very definitely exists, sir. Batman's ex-wife? No, no, no. The lady who played the part, sir. Mrs. Harriet Cooper, Dick Grayson's aunt. In fact, it was her idea. I'm giving credit where credit is due. Now I know where I've heard your voice before. Aren't you Alfred, the Wayne butler? Yes. Yes, sir, I am. Well, Alfred, if I ever need a wife on the spur of the moment, I'll know-- Begorra, I forgot. Bonnie said that my wife called when I was out and I haven't called her back. The same with me, Chief O'Hara. For the same reason, Commissioner Gordon? Well, being a wife, I'm sure she wonders about my temporary absence from the office as well as from home. And being a husband, what do you plan to tell her? The truth. What else? That you were hit by a cupid's dart? That you pleaded for the Queen of Diamonds' love on your knees? That you were locked in a gilded cage? It does sound rather far-fetched, doesn't it? Sure, and I couldn't have made up such a story myself. The wife never would believe it. If I may interject a thought. - Please do. -Please do. My experience with women has been that they tend to believe what they want to believe. So knowing you both to be conscientious gentlemen and faithful husbands I'm sure that if you just tell both your wives that you were involved in some special and, uh, confidential assignment that will suffice. Have you ever been married? Eh-- Well, no, no. Alfred, at the risk of sounding pompous experience with women and experience with wives are two vastly different things. Amen. Well, we've all learned something from this little escapade, have we not? And now if you'll excuse me, I must be getting back to my duties at Wayne Manor. - Of course, Alfred, and thank you again. -Commissioner. Chief O'Hara. If you care to use my private phone to call home, Chief O'Hara. - After you, Commissioner Gordon. -Oh, no, no, no, please. After you. No, sir. No, sir. It's your office and your phone. You go right ahead. Are you sure this potion will work, darling? I think so, deary. Of course there's always a certain amount of luck in these things, you know. Once, when I was a chemistry professor at Vassar, I-- Darling, please, enough of your academic past. Let's concentrate on the present. Now, Batman and Robin have already tripped the outer alarm. They should be on their way down here right now. Ah. Our guinea pigs have arrived. Holy trolls and goblins. Welcome, darlings. Welcome to Aunt Hilda's little den. - She has a surprise for you. -Careful, Robin. I'm sorry, Batman, but I'm afraid I must turn you and Robin into mice. - Mice? -Mice? Whee! What is it, Batman? I can't tell, Robin. It seems harmless enough. - You bumbling old hag, you failed again! -That's no way to talk to an old lady. You mind your own business, Boy Wonder. You're going to be in enough trouble as it is. Yes, Your Highness? Dispatch them. Yes, Your Highness. A caldron of creeps, Batman. Well put, Robin. I'm sure this one will work. It's guaranteed to turn them into lizards. You said the last one would have them running around on the floor squeaking. This time I'll add a little more, just to make sure. Missed again. I don't know what's wrong. Nothing seems to be working today. This one has to work. It's one of my best potions. It better be, darling. My Guardians are falling like ninepins. Oh! Another zero. Playtime is over, darling. Let the grownups take charge. Diamond dozing gas, Batman. Try not to breathe. This is my most powerful potion. It's never failed. Like all the others? I'll guarantee this will turn them into a pair of toads. I'll stake my reputation on it. You haven't much to lose. A pair of wriggling little toads. No word yet from Batman. L-- I'm getting worried, chief. Me too, commissioner. That felonious female is a devilish customer, all right. Batman and Robin can handle any male criminal in Gotham City but when it comes to women-- When it comes to women, Batman's the big loser, darling. A very big loser. What kind of trickery is this? - Where are Batman and Robin? -Right here. Say hello to the commissioner, Bat Toad. The woman's gone daft. She's taken leave of her senses. I'm afraid it's true, commissioner. We're right here. She's got us. Saints preserve us. The whole world's come unhinged. I'll take Circe. Say something to Chief O'Hara, Robin Toad. Holy hors d'oeuvres, Chief O'Hara. Keep that cat away from us. Robin, you poor boy. Commissioner, is it possible? Chief, I just don't know. But you remember what she did to us with that love potion of hers. She's diabolical, all right. The Dynamic Duo a pair of toads? Oh, what will become of Gotham City now? I don't know about Gotham City, darlings but Batman and Robin will become cat food unless I get my hands on the Bat Diamond. Oh. Batman what should we do? Better do what she says, commissioner. Otherwise, Robin and I will end up inside that fat cat. Gosh, Batman, I'm too young to be eaten. Don't worry, Robin. I'm sure Commissioner Gordon will cooperate with the Queen of Diamonds. But, Batman, I don't know where the Batcave is. That's right, Batman. Nobody does but you and Robin. I'm sure you could find out if you use that darling red phone. Should we do it, Batman? Yes, commissioner. - Oh, commissioner. -Yes, Batman? Never mind the phone. - Who said that? -Not me, Your Highness. The real Batman said it. Look over here. The Dynamic Duo themselves. Saints be praised. You're not toads after all. No, we're quite human, Chief O'Hara. But, Batman, how could those two toads talk just like you and Robin? Oh, darling, it was a simple little prank. - Some prank. -The Queen of Diamonds was relying on the Grand Mogul's ability as a ventriloquist to deceive you. But, Batman, the Bat Toad talked in your noble voice just a moment ago. So it did. You see, Batman knows a trick or two about ventriloquism. And a few tricks about getting out of barred cells. I was wondering how you managed that, darling. Thanks to the extraordinary transmitting powers of the Bat Diamond which you've been after we were able to carry on some long-distance computations in the Batcave. After we wired the bars of the cell to convert them to a radio aerial. You see, the tumbler lock on the cell door only had 3,724,521 possible combinations. Child's play for the Batcomputer. That was very clever of you, darling. Take care of them. Take care of them, I said. - Pinned like a wriggling toad. -So Well, I suppose this is the end of my little romp, eh, darlings? A one- to 10-year end, at least. I just hope it's taught you that diamonds aren't necessarily a girl's best friend, Marsha. Oh, Batman, darling you are so divinely square. Now, girls, after you've added the baking powder and salt throw in a dash of ground lizard to give it flavor. Ground lizard? Did I say ground lizard? I meant garlic, of course. Then a teaspoon-full of oregano. All the time Aunt Hilda was a frustrated cook. Yes, I think she'll be much happier with her recipes than with her potions. I just hope she doesnât turn the students into toads. Bruce, would you believe it if I told you I have a wart on my thumb? Yes, I'd believe it, Dick. But who else would? NARRATOR".

Batman A small theater inside Washington center. Gotham City's new palace of the arts. Wednesday afternoon the silent film festival draws to its close. This tittle is incorrect. It is not the end, but the beginning. The cue for one of the most baffling crime waves ever to confront the dynamic duo. Good afternoon, Mr. Van Jones. Ah, how do you do? On behalf of the committee I want to thank you for loaning us these rare films from your matchless collection. My pleasure, sir. Always delighted to do my bit for the lost art of the silent film. What the devil is this? Where did you come from? Well, I'm afraid, you're not allowed in here. Sorry, it's against the. . Your idea, Mr. Van Jones? Certainly not. I've spent a fortune collecting prints of old movies. But I'm hardly impressed by an amateur group who takes all the attention from them. Good day, sir. - The Riddler? - Correct, Chief O'Hara. The Prince of Puzzlers, that master of criminal conundrum. Our hopes for his reform have been blasted once again. Let's hope our unknown friend behind the mask is home. Yes, commissioner. We'll be right there. - What is it, Bruce? - The Riddler. Holy Triple Feature! Will that crook ever learn? That's a good question. While we pounder itto the Bat-poles. Excuse me. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na Batman "Why is a musician's bandstand like an oven?" Hmm! The manager found that, at the scene of the crime? - Right, Batman. - I just can't figure it out. All that thieving devil got for his trouble was 200 bucks. Make anything out of that riddle, Robin? I think I do. It depends on digging musician's slang. What do you mean, Boy Wonder? "Why is a musician's bandstand like an oven?" Because that's where he makes his bread. - That's it of course. - Makes bread? Precisely, Chief O'Hara. "Bread" in the musician's vernacular means money. Astonishing! But where can this clue point? - To an oven. - A bakery. Sure. Mother Gotham's Bakery. The biggest one in the city. I'll bet you a dollar the Riddler is after a fat roll. - The Riddler? - After a roll? Yes, commissioner. A fat and tasty roll. Mother Gotham's payroll. Come on, Robin. Let's race there fast. - Camera loaded, C. B. - Ready to roll, Riddler baby. Set it up. Remember everybody, stay in the range of C. B's camera. Mr. Van Jones has commissioned me to make him the greatest silent films since the days of immortal Charlie. Oh, I hope his budget is big enough to take care of us all, aye, Riddler? Silence, Von Bloheim. As I tried to tell you our silent film is merely a diversion, a clever ploy essential to our real crime. Ah! You mean, heisting the payroll? I do not. I do not. . Petty cash this payroll, a red herring for the dynamic duo. - Wolf, ready with the pies? - Ready. C. B, ready with the camera? Paulineprepare. Do your stuff. Oh, please, sir. Please, you must help me. - Help you? - Oh, yes. I must have some bread, to save my poor starving mother. Oh, well, I'm sorry. We don't sell bread back here. It doesn't matter. For I have no money with which to buy. Therefore I must beg. Oh, charity, kind sir. Charity. Well. I've had to sell everything I own. All except this torn, tattered shall. - Take it if you must. - Oh, no, no. . No, I insist. - Hold it. - What's wrong? - You can't come in here. - Why? We have pies to deliver. Take those pies down to shipping. That's at the other end. Ah, but these are special pies. Whipped sleeping cream and nuts. Whipped sleeping cream and nuts? Nuts to you! Ah! Von Bloheim, the explosive eclair. Quickly, quickly. Back to the truck for our new camera set up. I'll be with you, soon as I've decorated this place a bit. - How'd it go, fellows. - Oh, wunderbar. - Even the Oscar undoubtedly. - Inside, inside. Pauline into the front with me. Aim your camera through the slot, C. B our stars should arrive any moment now. 'Ready when you're, Riddler baby. ' 'Hey, here they come now. ' Action. Action. No sign of crime here, Batman. Looks like business as usual. We could have been deceived by that tricky clue. On the other hand. . Let's race inside and take a look at that payroll office. 'Got it all, Riddler baby. ' Good. Hold tight, everybody. On to the next location. Mother Gotham never baked this pie. It's topped with sleeping cream. We're too late. Look at that blow safe. Look at that wall. "Batman! As one baker to another. "How do you make a dishonest shortcake?" "Dishonest shortcake?" - There's strawberry shortcake. - And blueberry shortcake. - A dishonest shortcake. - I've got it. A lie-berry. That would make it a dishonest shortcake. Right, Robin. Lie-berry. Clearly a corrupted version of the word library. "As one baker to another. " Hey, isn't there a branch library on Baker Street? Of course and Aunt Harriet goes there all the time. We haven't a moment to lose. Let's race to the Batmobile. Gotham City Library, Bakers Street Branch. Right again, dynamic duo. Be careful. - Roll on, C. B. - Roll on. Look at that crump. 'Right in a well marked, no parking zone. ' He's within his rights, Robin. Observe. Diplomatic plates. The heart of diplomats in our city is a small prize to pay for world leadership. Now, let's check out that library. "Baker Street Branch closed on Wednesdays "because of lack of funds. " Shocking, shocking. Looks like this lock has been tampered with, Batman. You're right. We'll use the Bat-key. - Cut. - Cut! Quickly now, before the duo awake. Back to our screening room to see how this crime develops. - Oh! - Holy headache! What hit us? A clever booby trick. A bash on the head by this weighty tome. "A Pictorial History of Silent Films. " Here it is. It's the same theme that's run through this entire caper from the outset. Look, Batman. Two more riddles on the flyleaf. Tough ones too. Let's race back to the Bat-cave. This needs more research. Meanwhile in the abandoned cutting room of a bankrupt movie studio the new secret headquarters of the Riddler and his felonious filmsters. So, this rough cut is ready. Roll 'em, Von Bloheim. Roll 'em. . First sequence in Mother Gotham's Bakery. Wow! What a gasser. Our stars. Our unwitting stars, Von Bloheim. - Where are they? - Oh, just a moment. They make their appearance in the picturenow. 'Action. ' Now comes the topper! Oh! Watch. Watch these costume clowns dance to my tune. Oh! But we have an even more dazzling one to film. My tricky brew. All ready for the fatal party. Are you sure Batman and Robin will be there, Riddler baby? Of course they'll be there. On the flyleaf of that book, I left them the clearest clues conceivable. "Riddle number one. "What do you find in a kitchen cabinet "that is not alive?" I should hope, sir, that in the cabinet of a properly run kitchen one would find nothing whatever alive. Alfred's right, Batman. In a clean kitchen cabinet, everything should be dead. Dead knifes, dead forks, dead spoons-- Dead pots, dead pans. . Deadpans! - Beg pardon, sir. - Don't you see, Alfred. It fits right in with the criminal theme. Deadpans, like those comics used to use in the old silent films. Deadpan expressions. Riddler's telling us his next will be a deadpan caper. Ah, yes. Most ingenious. Now, let's apply our brain power to riddle number two. "When is a new car considered to be seedy?" Holy kindergarten! That's almost too easy. A new car is seedy when it's a lemon. - Right. - You don't fancy, sir. That this famous desperado intends to stoop to the robbery of a lemonade stand? You've hit it! It fits like my glove. What, Batman? Mr. Van Jones is a famous collector of deadpan silent films. He's also a noted Temperance leader. And he's invited Bruce Wayne to a party this afternoon in which nothing will be served but lemonade. Wow! Will Mr. Wayne attend, sir? Send his regrets, Alfred, he will not. But Batman will. Come on, Robin, we may still have time to spike Riddler's punch. Watch what this liquid does when it is introduced into the drinks, you will see a Temperance Party shot intoa Temper Party. Alas, too late, for even as the dynamic duo speeds towards the residence of Millionaire Van Jones someone else is in Van Jones' pantry first. Spiking the punch. That should bring out the temper in these Temperance fellows. Got the camera handy, C. B? Where I can grab it in a jiffy. Happy shooting. Enjoythe comedy to come. Maury Wills is better than Honus Wagner? Fifty times better. You're an ignorant oaf, Chief O'Hara. I wonder why I keep you in my department? Your Royal Highness, often I wondered why I don't resign. Oops! You clumsy brut, did you bump into me on purpose? I'm sorry. Terribly. I didn't think Batman was on your guest list, Mr. Van Jones? Considering these louds who were, dearie. 'I'd say that's entirely in his favor. ' Pretty sour lemonade, Van Jones. You don't like it, lump it. Personally I think, it's unusually sweet. The boors a man in my position has to tolerate. Is it worth it? Nah! Batman to Batmobile. All quite here, Batman. Any sign of the Riddler? Not a trace, Robin. But there's something strange going on here. Everyone seems to be in the most incredibly bad temper. - 'It's pink. ' - In fact. . Say that once again, stupid. Your dress is pink, color blind. I'll call you back. Give him a solid. . Oh, sir. Sir, please help me. Please. What's the matter? A horrible man dressed in green tights just leapt out of the bushes and seized my little brother. What? Dress in green? Yes. And he shouted the strangest thing. He said, "A clue. " He shouted at me and "When is a bonnet not a bonnet?" The Riddler. And that clue's a snap. A bonnet is not a bonnet, when it becomes a young woman. Oh, how clever you are. Citizens! Stop it. Stop it! Stop this. Have you all lost your senses? The Batman spots us. Batman to, Robin. Batman calling, Robin. 'Do you read me, Robin?' 'Robin. ' Riddle me this, my criminal crew. When does a Boy Wonder, rhyme with bubble? When he's in trouble. Wrong. When he's double. Split in two halves. . right down the middle. Camera ready to roll, C. B? Rollin, Riddler baby. How would you like your sideburns, Boy Wonder? Long or short? Batman will get you for this, Riddler. - Oh! - 'But will he get you?' I believe you said, he'd be here in no time? Question? Is no time, in time? Uh! After many gassers here's the real buzzer! Is Robin going to wind up as his own double? Incredible but true. Batman will not arrive in time! Will we see the Boy Wonder sawed in two? Tune in tomorrow! Same Bat-time! Same Bat-channel! Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". Another crystal-clear day in Londinium. Though things are getting a bit thick in Superintendent Watson's office in venerable Ireland Yard. Before we left Ffogg Place, we had ample evidence that Lord Ffogg and Lady Peasoup could be the culprits you called us here from Gotham City to uncover. The Delayed-Action Knock-Out Fog Capsule that exploded in the Batmobile cinched it. Luckily, our General Emergency Batextinguisher took care of that. Do you suppose those highwaymen might have planted something similar on Batgirl's Cycle, Batman? Batgirl's Cycle? Yes, she turned up outside Ffogg Place. Don't ask me how or why or where she went. We never really saw her Batgirl Cycle. Remember, old churn? She may have escaped completely unscathed. But how can Lord Ffogg be involved in these robberies, Batman? With his gout so bad? You saw his foot yourself. Possibly an act. Well, was it an act too that Lady Peasoup invited Ms. Gordon, the commissioner's own daughter to join the faculty of Ffogg Place even for a short while? I strongly recommend she does not accept. And I strongly recommend that we do not offend one of the most aristocratic families in the land. Holy gullibility. Pardon me, commissioner, but she's headed for trouble. Lady Prudence, Lord Ffogg's daughter Barbara, your ears must be burning. We were just talking about you. Favorably, I trust. Your secretary asked me to bring this parcel in to Batman, superintendent. It just arrived and she said I needn't knock-- Huh! Look out, Batman, it's smoking. Yes, it seems about to explode. You better all stand back. Three silver bells. Holy tintinnabulation. They're pretty. But what could they mean? It could be a clue of some kind. Or a come-on. Exactly, Robin. Superintendent, isn't there a famous pub somewhere in Londinium named the Three Bells? Oh, indeed there is, Batman. On the river in the dock area. Many's the pint of wallop I have there. Ha, ha. Or had, I should say, before the hippies took over. - Hippies? -The mod set. Barnaby Street. They've taken over the Three Bells. Is there some kind of objective there that a canny criminal might be interested in? Well, uh, ships loading and unloading in the dock area nearby. But wait. There's a ship due to leave the dock near the Three Bells late today. With a cargo of materials and patterns from Barnaby Street, bound for our dominions. Holy rising hemlines. Are we being dared to stop a robbery of miniskirts, Batman? NARRATOR". And shortly at Ffogg Place Our possible hostage is arriving any minute now, Marmaduke. And I don't see why the girls and I are expected to go down to the docks and be by the Three Bells. It was your idea, my sweet, to lift that cargo bound for the dominions from Barnaby Street. Yes, but that was before we decided to fog in on the Crown Jewels in the Tower of Londinium. A master plan involves various stages of preparation, Penelope. This stage involves not only the purloining of a shipment of material thereby controlling the fashion world of Londinium but getting rid of Batman once and for all. Batman, who, if he has received my pungent parcel should be in the Three Bells. Ms. Gordon, Your Ladyship. How nice to see you again, Ms. Gordon. But I'm afraid we've had a slight change of plan. The girls and I have to run into Londinium and Lord Ffogg has an appointment in the city too. I'm so glad to see your gout is better, Lord Ffogg. MY gout? Oh, yes. It always improves with the change of weather. Well, I'll have a chance to meet the rest of the faculty, anyway. I am the rest of the faculty, Ms. Gordon. Along with Lady Prudence, of course. Speaking of Lady Prudence, sister dear, I think she should remain here with Ms. Gordon. I think she'll show Ms. Gordon everything Ms. Gordon should be shown. And now that we've gotten you all the way out to Ffogg Place, we're not going to let you go. Meanwhile in Londinium's dock area This is the pub, old chum. And that appears to be the ship. With its cargo from Barnaby Street. Let's go. Not you, Robin. They have strict licensing laws in this country. A boy of your age is not allowed in a tavern. But if it's been taken over by the hippies and mod set You're far from mod, Robin. And many hippies are older than you are. Why don't you wait by the Batmobile? I have a hunch that you'll be of good use there. You'll know where to find me if you need me. Right, Batman. A far cry from the old days, Your Lordship. It was more fun when the Three Bells was full of foot pegs and cutthroats. - Aye, me folks used to come here then. -The world changes, fellows. Skirts go up and beards grow out, but a pound note still does its job. Yeah, you're right. Sure. Batman. Batman, indeed. Delighted to see that your gout has cleared up, Lord Ffogg. You're the second observant person I've met today. - Would you care to join us in a tankard? -I don't drink. Not to drink, old boy? What are you doing in this pub? I suspect you can answer that better than I. No doubt I can. Very agile, Batman, but hardly observant. Otherwise you'd have realized that every person in this pub knows where his next meal is coming from. NARRATOR". And while the Caped Crusader is cornered - Oh, it's Robin, the Boy Wonder. -Oh. I'm out of my skin. You're out of your mind. He's cut the boat loose. It's drifting away. With all those crazy mod materials. Use your wits, girls, as you've been taught. - You too, Duchess. -Groovy. You 20th-century witch, Lady Peasoup. You know I wouldn't fight a female. Even a small army of females. Spoken like a true gentleman, Boy Wonder. Gosh, what marvelous threads. Now, now, now, girls, stop gushing and pick him up. We must get out of here. NARRATOR". Back in their rendezvous outside Ffogg Place I don't understand that Lady Prudence, Alfred. Lord Ffogg's daughter. But I strongly suspect Lady Peasoup is running a school for gentlecrooks not gentlewomen. - She told you that? -Not in so many words. But I think there's strong feeling between her and her aunt. And Lady Prudence could be playing all sides against each other for reasons of her own. - How did you get away? -It wasn't easy. I'll explain later. Now, back to the city to report to your father? No, back to Lord Ffogg's Cricket Pavilion. It's the only place she didn't show me, and I may learn something from it. Lord Ffogg allows no one but his sister and himself inside it. And I'm not at all sure that I can allow you, miss. Batgirl can take care of herself, Alfred. But you can do something for me. Get a message to my father telling him I'll be staying here later than I'd expected. And ask him to alert Batman. - Can you do that? -I can certainly try, miss. NARRATOR". So it's back to being Batgirl for Barbara Gordon. And in due time slipping into the forbidden Cricket Pavilion at Ffogg Place. "Count of Claremont's coin collection. " "Duchess of Desborough's diamonds. " "Her Majesty's priceless snuffboxes. " And "Lady Easterland's jeweled Easter eggs. " NARRATOR". But whose side is Prudence on? While in the Three Bells pub By now, Lady Peasoup should be in control of the boat's cargo. She should be in control of Barnaby Street and the Londinium world of fashions. A step closer to the king of crime mounting a suitable throne and wearing the Crown Jewels. So we may leave and leave Batman here. Here, Your Lordship? Aren't you asking for a spot of trouble, sir? - Blimey. - Don't worry, mates. Dynamic Dolt will remember nothing of what has happened when I get through with him. Thanks to this remarkable device which when fastened to his skull and activated will reverse the recollection center. I know nothing about your remarkable device, Lord Ffogg. But your grisly game is almost up. Proof of your villainy is inscribed indelibly on my mind. Which will shortly be erased. Hold his head still. Behold. No man has ever been more fogbound than Batman at this very moment. You may untie him. He may not be able to move for a moment or two but when he does, his mind will be completely blank. A pretty puzzlement for our friends at Ireland Yard. Toodle-loo, old boy. Good gracious, sir. What's happened to you? I don't know. Who are you, sir? Who am I? I better get you to the Batcave at once. Batcave? Yes. You know, the Londinium Batcave. Whatever's happened to Master Robin? Robin? Well, never mind that. We'll talk about that later. Now, you just get into this car. Come on. That's it. I'll drive. It appears, sir, that you're suffering from a severe loss of memory. Fortunately, however, I packed the Recollection Cycle Bat Restorer for this little overseas trip. Now, sit down, sir. It won't take a minute. Here we go. I don't know about this. You may hear a bit of a buzzing at first. Aah! Of course. I remember everything now. You're Alfred, I'm Batman. But what could have happened to Robin? I remember leaving him in front of that pub to guard the boat with Barnaby Street's materials. There was no boat by that dock, sir. Yes, I remember. I remember not seeing the boat, I remember not seeing Robin, I re-- Possibly he's got in touch with Commissioner Gordon at venerable Ireland Yard. Good thinking, Alfred. I'll place a call right now to Superintendent Watson. Sure, and it was a fine flight I had over. And it's a beautiful city you have here too, superintendent. I'm only sorry I have to turn right around and go back home. Better for you to convey the minutes of the last meeting to Mayor Linseed in person, Chief O'Hara, rather than trust them to the mails. I can't argue about that, commissioner. There's nothing like an Irish carrier pigeon. Venerable Ireland Yard. Superintendent Watson here. Oh, hello, Batman. Oh, yes, of course. -It's for you, commissioner. -Yes, Batman? That perfidious Lord Ffogg trapped me in the Three Bells pub, commissioner. While, somehow, the boat for the dominion's mysteriously vanished. The boat vanished? With its cargo of mini cloth'? I'll get the river patrol on it immediately. Along with Robin? No, Batman, I haven't heard a word from him. But are you all right? Never better. I'll get back to you. Nothing. Nothing. How did you find me, Alfred? It concerns Batgirl, sir. Uh, she's discovered that the finishing school at Ffogg Manor is for girl criminals. She's now investigating the super-secret Cricket Pavilion there. She thought you ought to know. - But how did you--? -And to answer your first question, sir I tracked you to the dock area by the Batmobile Bat-tracking Device. Good show, Alfred. About Batgirl Ah. So she really is a Batgirl. Still paralyzed by that paralyzing gas you turned off, Lady Peasoup. She'll recover shortly. And when she does, perhaps she should find herself in the dungeon with her young male counterpart, Robin. - You ogress, you vixen. -Heh. Yes. Well, the dungeon is immediately below our gallery. Ladies first. That must be His Lordship. He's the only one who knows this number. Hello, Marmaduke? Where are you? At my club in Bleet Street, Penelope. Did you get that mini material off the Barnaby Street boat? No. All we got was the Boy Wonder. He cut the hawsers on the boat and it drifted down the river. What are you doing in Cricket Pavilion? I tried every phone at Ffogg Place. I'm putting him and Batgirl in the dungeon. Batgirl? Bats come in both sexes, Marmaduke. And this female of the specie broke into your treasure trove. What happened with Batman? We've taken care of him. But I have a much better idea for Robin than that dungeon. All right, Alfred, I'll respect your reticence concerning Batgirl. Thank you, sir. - Finding Robin is the first order of the day. -The Batcomputer, sir. We have no choice. There. âWench. Wench. Wunch. " It doesn't make sense, Alfred. Well, perhaps in moving, the Batcomputer is a bit off-kilter, sir. "Winch. " It still doesn't make sense. It may, sir. The most prominent winch in Londinium is in the winch room inside the Tower Bridge which operates the mechanism which raises the arms of the bridge to let ships through. Which wind you to death when the next ship comes along. Torturer, sadist. You're worse than your sister. A high compliment. Well, let's go outside and watch the Boy Wonder die. - Pip-pip, chin-chin, cheerio. Ha, ha. -Ha, ha. NARRATOR". As an approaching ship starts activating Tower Bridge Robin has good reason to look horrified. If that ship gets closer to that bridge, Robin's done for. Quickly, Alfred, the Anti-Mechanical Batray in the Bat-glove Compartment. To save his life, we'll have to zero the Bat-ray in on the mechanical apparatus and render them useless. Something's happened. - The blooming bridge has stopped moving. -Blimey. Oh, we'd better get back to the winch room, governor. Tally-ho, away we go. - Batman. How'd you get here? -Down a bascule. - Bascule? -Yes, an escapement in which the detent is mounted on a pivotal axis. The Dynamic Destroyer. About to destroy you, Lord Ffogg. That pipe. Exactly, Batman. My pipe of fog. NARRATOR". What's this? Batman and Robin fogbound in the winch room of Tower Bridge? And Batgirl still paralyzed by paralyzing fog in the dungeon of Ffogg Place? By Jove, it's disturbing. By Jove, it's exciting. By Jove, it's mystifying. By Jove, watch the next episode. By Jove. 
NARRATOR". A sunny Wednesday morning in Gotham City. The sort of Wednesday that makes you wish it were Sunday. And at Gotham City City Hall a stream of tourists wend their way in to see the curios and trophies on permanent display. And this, ladies and gentlemen is the original charter of Gotham City. And due to its excessive age and delicate condition it has been sealed in this guaranteed burglar-proof display case which has been vacuum sealed to protect such a valuable document. Oh, guide, are you absolutely certain it's burglar-proof? Absolutely. And now, if you step this way, please. Your eggspert has much to learn. No material can resist my incomparable eggsplosives. And now, let us make our eggsit. Impossible. That a criminal could march in and purloin Gotham City's most priceless possession right under our nostrils? But why, commissioner? That's what I can't figure out. Nor can I, O'Hara, nor can I. What did the witnesses say? Oh, there's no doubt about it. They all agreed on one thing: His description. - It was Egghead, all right. -The rottenest egg of them all. Any suggestions, O'Hara? Well, it isn't so bad facing thieves, murderers, run-of-the-mill crooks, but-- I know it seems we call on the Caped Crusader pretty often. There's no other way to handle it. NARRATOR". And in stately Wayne Manor, home of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward Dick Grayson: If you'll hold the line a moment, sir I will gain his attention for you. You see, Dick, many years ago Gotham City was founded by three families who landed at Gotham Rock. - The Savages, the Tylers and the Waynes. -Right. The original land was leased from the Mohican Indians for the price of nine raccoon pelts. Wow, what a deal that was. Every five years, the lease has to be renewed. The city charter is very specific about honoring that debt. Tonight is the night to make payment, so Pete Savage, Tim Tyler and I the descendants of the original settlers, have to deliver three raccoon pelts each to Chief Screaming Chicken in order to fulfill the obligation. Gosh, where did you get the pelts? I had to buy a whole raccoon coat from a very popular crooner of the 1920s who'd fallen on hard times. Had to pay a pretty price for it too. This one's held up very well for a raccoon. A matter of grave importance has arisen. Your attention would be appreciated. A contract to be, ahem, read. - I will take care of it immediately, Alfred. - I'll go with you, Bruce. Honestly, Alfred, those two are so busy. I'll wager Batman and Robin don't get around as much as Bruce and Dick. I, uh-- I rather doubt that, madam. - Yes, commissioner. -Dire news, Batman. Egghead is back with a carton full of crime. We'll be right there. To the Batpoles. Why go to all that trouble to steal the city charter? Who knows what evil lurks. He's a tough egg, Batman, the smartest man in the world. The second-smartest man in the world. Present company excepted, of course. He's assuredly the smartest villain we've ever faced. Any evidence left at the scene of the crime? None, Boy Wonder. Frankly, we're stumped. The Gotham City Charter. What does it say? Aside from its constitutional edicts its purpose is to act as a treaty between the Mohican Indians and the founders. Holy Bill of Rights. Maybe Egghead wants to start a war between the Gotham City citizens and the Indians. I rather doubt it, Robin. There's only one Indian left. He'd be outnumbered ten million to one. I think it has something to do with the leasing conditions. That probably means Egghead will make a deal with Peter Savage, Tim Tyler or Bruce Wayne. Egghead does not make deals. Oh, where is Peter Savage now? Undoubtedly at his home here in Gotham City. He spends most of his time in Paris. He's something of a bon vivant and patron of the arts. But he's always here for the Raccoon Ceremony and to distribute the pelts. And I think I know where Tim Tyler is. Probably at Tyler Stadium, watching his team play baseball against the Pets. That leaves only Bruce Wayne. I, uh, wonder where he is. Unquestionably, out doing something inconsequential with his youthful ward, Dick Grayson. You know how those millionaire playboys are. - Let's go, Robin. -Where to? To the teepee of Screaming Chicken, last of the Mohicans. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, behind the doors of an apparently legitimate import firm: Eggscellent. I might even go so far as to say eggsquisite. What you got in mind, boss? This just looks like some old piece of paper. That's because you have no foresight, Benedict. Not everybody is as smart as you are, Egghead. Not anybody is as smart as I am, Foo Yung. Ha, ha. Please, don't talk so fast. What's she following us around for all the time? I don't like dames on capers. Fortunately, not everyone thinks like that, Mr. Benedict. Hi, Eggybaby. Please, it's Mr. Egghead before other people, not Eggybaby. My eggsecutive secretary, Miss Bacon, is taking down my every thought. That way posterity will have on record the working of the most brilliant criminal mind of all time. If I do say so myself. You gonna publish a book? Well, now, let us eggsamine this more carefully, huh? There must be a loophole in this charter that will enable me to eggstort control of the city. Here it is. Look at that, my rotten eggs. "Whereas, and to wit if the price of nine raccoon pelts is not paid to the Mohican representative by the descendants of the Savage, Tyler and Wayne families and whereas, if it is not paid on time said land will revert back to its original owners and/or their legal representatives. " Oh, we've got them this time. We've caught them with their eggs post facto down. - What's he talking about? -Search me. - A little slower, please. My fingers hurt. -Eh, mm? Don't you know who the representative of the Mohicans is? Oh, you mean that little guy that's got the blanket concession out on the highway? Eggsactly. Chief Screaming Chicken the last of the Mohicans. - How? -What? - When? -Where? You, you are only person in Gotham City who know traditional Mohican greeting. I've long been a student of your tribal customs, Chief Screaming Chicken. What you want with Screaming Chicken? Tonight's the night when you receive payment on the Gotham City lease renewal. Me think price too low for Gotham City. Nine raccoon pelts, cost of living go up and up. Me want 12 raccoon pelts. The contract was for nine. Indian poor businessman. My cousin, oh He sell Manhattan for 24 dollars. Could have got 35. Be that as it may, Chief Screaming Chicken I'm here to make sure you're present at the ceremonies tonight. It's imperative that you attend. Absolutely. Thank you. Ciao, Chief. A magnificent eggshibition, Chief Screaming Chicken. When I'm done with you, you will be able to eggsercise your most eggstravagant desires. If you give me an eggsclusive lease on Gotham City. Me no give you lease, not until tonight. Me honor-bound, if paid nine raccoon pelt. - And if not? -Me deal with highest bidder. But don't worry, they pay me pelts. They always do, it is tradition. Ah, but tonight, one of those men won't show up and then the lease will eggspire. You make mighty big talk, kemosabe. Kemosabe? I thought I heard just about everything but. - Yeah, Screaming, what's that mean? -Me no know. Me hear it once on radio. Very old word. It's no use, Robin. Not a single new egg company has opened in Gotham City in the last few weeks. I can't understand. That's his usual modus operandi. Egghead always has his hideout associated with some sort of egg outfit. Obviously, he's changed his way of thinking and if that's not enough, he's probably changed the way he-- Oh, well, that's it. Of course. What kind of company sells eggs that you can't fry, scramble or boil? - A fish egg company. -Right, Robin. Let's see what that brings. Look at this. A new egg firm has just opened on Point View Street. "The Ghoti Oeufs Caviar Company. " "Oeuf" means "eggs" in French, but I don't get this other word at all. The word is "fish," Robin. -"Ghoti" is "fish"? -See here, English phonetics. G-H becomes F as in "tough" or "laugh. " O becomes I as in "women. " T-I becomes S-H as in "ration" or the word "nation. " Holy semantics, Batman, you never cease to amaze me. No time for compliments now, Robin. We must thwart some criminals. To the Batmobile. Oh, you're making a fine deal, Chief Screaming Chicken. One hundred dollars a month for life and all the eggs you can eat. Me 60 years old now. Me need them pension. You 60? I hope I look that good when I'm 60. Well, I have great eggspectations for our relationship, chief. I tell you what I'll give you as an added bonus: You may have the import-eggsport concession for all genuine American Indian blankets made in Japan. Oh, heh. You are one heck of fine pale face. Mm. Yeah. - You no Indian giver? -Oh, no. Eggybaby never gave an Indian anything. Well, I for one am eggshausted. It's been a trying day, and I must rest my fantastic brain for tonight. There'll be no rest for the wicked today, Egghead. Boy, do you guys have egg on your faces. All the king's horses and all the king's men won't be able to put you together again. Oh, Batman, you're so lyrical. Well, that's enough eggsercise for one day, Batman. You no stop, me give Boy Wonder very short haircut. You, Chicken, turn chicken? Have you joined the enemy camp as well? This is an acid egg, Batman. One move and I'll drop it on Robin's head. Nobody could be that rotten. Don't tempt me. Ow! You put all your eggs in one basket, Egghead, a fatal mistake. Prepare yourself for an eggspeditious defeat. - That's very apt, Robin. -Oh, glad you liked it. Well, see how you like this. - What is it, Batman? -I don't know. Whatever it is, it's awfully funny. The yolk's on them, it's laughing gas. Ha, ha! It's the funniest trick anyone's ever pulled on us. - Yes. -Ha-ha-ha! It's even funnier than the Joker. I can't stop laughing. And you won't, not until the gas wears off. - Let's go, boss, before we start laughing too. -An eggscellent idea. - Let's go after them. -No, no, no. Not now, old chum. In our condition, it won't do us any good. Here, here. Here, take this. It's a sad pill to neutralize the laughing gas. Ha-ha-ha! It'll clear our minds. Well, he may have won the first round but we're going to fight fire with fire. Robin we'll never beat Egghead with brute strength. We must-- We must out-think him. That poor, misguided redskin, Chief Screaming Chicken is obviously under Eggheads influence. Therefore, it stands to reason that the lease to Gotham City must be close to being in Egghead's greedy hands. How do we stop it from happening? Egghead must prevent either one or all three of the millionaires from delivering their pelts in order to break the lease. - Shall I call Tim Tyler and Pete Savage? -I'll do it. The machine is attuned to Bruce Wayne's voice. Klondike 57589, please. Gosh, Batman, I've never seen you use a telephone directory. - How do you remember all those numbers? -Elementary, my dear Robin. I simply transpose the numbers into letters. For example, Pete Savage's number is the name of a girl that he and I used to date. Holy IT&T. Hello? Hello, Pete, Bruce Wayne here. I'm calling to see whether you'll be attending the anniversary celebration tonight. It's the Raccoon Ceremony, you know. Certainement, I'll be there. You're grand marshal this year, aren't you? Heh, yes, it should be fun. It's nice to have you back in town, Pete. Be it ever so humble, there is no place like Gotham City. Au revoir, Pete. Very good, Mr. Savage. Everything sounds good there, let's try Tim Tyler. Quentin 65701, please. You can't make a word out of that one because of the one and the zero. Things don't always work out like we want them to. When that happens, I simply depend on my well-developed memory. When was the last time you called that number? - Yesterday. -Sally, you're a whiz, Batman. - Tim Tyler speaking. -Hello, Tim, this is Bruce Wayne. Bruce, how are you? - Are you attending the ceremony tonight? -Wouldn't miss it if it meant my life. - Oh, that's swell. See you there. -Right. You demonstrated uneggspected good sense, Mr. Tyler. What do you want from me, Egghead? I am just a poor major-league baseball team owner. How about season tickets? I love halfbacks. How eggsasperating. Oh, what a beautiful night. Mercy alive, do we look sharp? Have a good time, boys. And don't stay out too late, you know how I worry. I wonder where our official escort is. - Dick, do you have the pelts? -Here they are. But I doubt if Chief Screaming Chicken will be there to claim them. Not after all he's done. Still, we must live up to our part of the bargain and deliver nine pelts before midnight. I'll never understand why Chief Screaming Chicken decided to put in with Egghead. He told me once that he worked for a while as a bottle washer. He had an argument with a boss who told him to go back to his own country. - But this is his country. -Ha-ha-ha. Exactly. And you wonder why Chief Screaming Chicken is dissatisfied. - Your escort, sir. -Thank you, Alfred. - So they got you too. -What do you mean? This is a trap, Bruce. Egghead is driving this limousine. And we walked right into it. We can always get out. - There's no handle on this door. - That's correct. So get ready for an eggsotic eggsperience. There are several reasons why I called this meeting, gentlemen aside from the obvious one of keeping you all from the anniversary ceremonies when Chief Screaming Chicken appears to collect his raccoon pelts. It has occurred to me that one of you is Batman. - How exciting. -Yes, you see this fiendish machine? Well, it's one of my own inventions. For lack of another name for it, I call it an electro thought transferor. It sucks every shred of information from the mind of the person sitting under that apparatus and places it in the brain of the one under this one. - How ugly. -How disgusting. How eggshilarating. Long ago, my superior intellect deduced that Batman must be a person who was a millionaire and didn't have to work because crime-fighting is such an eggspensive hobby. - Which one is it, Eggybaby, hmm? -Please, please, Miss Bacon. All of you are approximately the right age, in your early 30s but I have eliminated you, Mr. Tyler, because you are left-handed. No, the Caped Crusader is not a port-sider. And you, Mr. Savage, are out because of your accent. So aside from a couple of aging rock 'n' roll singers you, Mr. Wayne, are the only Gotham City millionaire who is athletically inclined with eggsessive agility. Therefore, you must be Batman. You realize this is all a waste of time. Not at all, Mr. Wayne. My machine has a rather eggscentric and ugly side effect. In removing all of the knowledge from your brain it will leave you an empty-headed fop. There's no use struggling, Mr. Wayne you're being held there by an electromagnetic force. I'm leaving. Things like this give me a headache. All right, Benedict, turn on the machine. It will take a moment or two to warm up and then we shall see if my eggseptional logistics are correct. But even if I'm wrong about your being Batman, Mr. Wayne your brain will be utterly destroyed. 
Gotham Park Racetrack. . . the day before the Bruce Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap where two fancy fillies are meeting the press: A high-spirited horse and her proud-spirited mistress. Can you say "cheese," baby? - it's not "baby. " It's Lola Lasagne. - Senora Lola Lasagne. -Can you get that nag to crack a smile? If you're referring to my prize-winning filly with that wonderful white stripe on her forehead she'd much rather be called Parasol. A most appropriate name, I believe. Haven't you got the corner on the world's supply of shower sticks? Shower sticks? You must mean my famous collection of parasols. Hold this. Priceless, you know. Shape up, Parasol. Looks and your legs are all we've got left. NARRATOR". But what's this strange bird doing in the royal surroundings of a queen of the turf and the sport of kings? You waddling bird. Ah What is this? You can't just barge in here cut open a locked case, and walk off with a priceless folio of famous parasols. -Why not? Among other things, it's a felony. Faugh, I'm a tax-paying citizen and this is a public library. That shouldn't have been locked in the first place. I'm gonna call the police. - Your beloved father, I presume? -Exactly. Stay where you are. I'm putting you under citizen's arrest. A tax-paying citizen's arrest, I hope. Dad, Barbara. The Penguin just waddled in here, cut open a locked case and tried to waddle off with-- Just a minute. He's gone. But he left an umbrella in the umbrella stand and it's Ticking? Ticking? The umbrella handle is ticking. Holy time bomb. Lucky we happened to be here. Boy Wonder, you took the words out of me mouth. Tell her not to remove the umbrella. Penguin will want to escape alive, which should give us time to get there. Come, Robin. Batman and Robin are on their way now, Barbara. You better leave there quickly. Leave the library? Dad, I'm not going to let a ticking umbrella handle frighten me off my job. If you say so, but don't touch that umbrella. Brazen bird. I'll wager there's a connection between this and that parasol he stole from Lola Lasagne today at the racetrack. You wager, Chief O'Hara? A public servant and upstanding chief of police betting? Uh, can I call it a hunch, commissioner? Well, with the Dynamic Duo on our side, I think "hunch" is most appropriate. Haven't you some Anti-Percussion Asbestos Bat-flax in your utility belt? No time for that now, Robin. Let's get this offending article out into the corridor and under the Bat-bomb Machine. No need for concern, Miss Gordon. Just a practical joke. Well, some practical joke. The umbrella handle was loaded with explosives. And you say Penguin left it in the umbrella stand because you prevented his stealing a priceless folio from a locked case? Yes, of famous parasols. Ah. Hardly a reason for an attempt on your life, Miss Gordon. You may remember he once tried to force me to marry him. - Ah - Gosh, yes. But thanks to Batgirl, that wedding never took place. Yes, thanks to Batgirl. Hm. And I can understand a man like Penguin harboring jealousy and revenge but murder and locked cases priceless parasols, famous folios - Wanna give the Batcomputer a crack at it? - Good idea, Robin. NARRATOR". While in Penguin's Bookshop or to be more accurate, Penguin's bookmaking shop Penguin's Bookshop. Yeah, Apricot Soup in the sixth at Pimlico. Ten grand on the nose. You got it, Frankie. - Ten grand for Frankie. -Right, Penguin. Ha-ha. I received a note. I might find my priceless stolen parasol here. It's not as priceless as all that. A little research has proved to me that it is a fake. Just as you are a fake, Lulu Schultz. And I didn't need any research to prove that. Ha-ha! - Lulu Schultz? -Mm. I am Senora Lola Lasagne. Horse feathers, Lulu. I knew you back when. I knew you when you'd steal the braces from other kids' teeth. - While you stole their teeth. -Ha! But you're still very clever, Pengy. I thought I had the whole world fooled. Now, now, what about the other Parasol, the four-legged one? Is that also a fake? Do you mean my prize-winning filly with the white stripe in the middle of her forehead? -Eh. That's the only thing I have to show for my three weeks of marriage to Luigi Lasagne. What? The billionaire South American playboy? Not exactly a playboy, Pengy. - Luigi's almost 80. -Oh Instead of dying, as any adoring young wife might reasonably expect he divorced me. -Ah. Can you imagine? He thought I was after his money. Ooh, what slander. Faugh. And that stingy old judge. - All he gave me was one horse. -Ew. Yes. Why, I even had to sell my real priceless collection of parasols for eating money. -Mm-mm. But if my horse, Parasol, should win the Bruce Wayne Handicap tomorrow think of the purse. What purse? It's an empty purse. All the proceeds in that race go to the Bruce Wayne Memorial Foundation. I think we've given the Batcomputer sufficient time and a thorough enough dusting, Alfred. It must have heard you. "Umbrella, parasol. A sunshade coming under the general category of covering, such as veiling, curtaining blanketing--" -Blanketing. Blanketing. That may be the clue we've been looking for. Wet blanket. Blanket of snow. Or perhaps something in the bedding department. An eiderdown or counterpane. No, I doubt it very much, Alfred. Blanket, blanket Wet blanket. Blanket of snow. Plaid blanket. Horse-- Horse blanket. Of course, Parasol is the name of a horse entered in the Bruce Wayne Handicap by Senora Lola Lasagne. Look, the Bat-correction Signal. "Lulu Schultz. " Lola Lasagne must be a pseudonym. - That's a sticky one. -Sticky. Paste, mucilage, glue-- Gluten. Another card. "Glu Gluten's Glue Factory. " We start outwith parasols and come up with a glue factory. - Holy non sequiturs. -I don't think so, Robin. We all know that we're dealing with a devious bird of prey in the Penguin. And we certainly know, sir, that the Batcomputer is above any practical joke. So? So now that night has fallen I propose that we pay an unexpected visit to Glu Gluten's Glue Factory. Remain alert, Alfred. Who knows what trouble we may run into? Robin. You can depend on me, sir. - Hello? - Miss Gordon? Oh, hello. I've just heard that Batman and Robin have taken off for Glu Gluten's Glue Factory on an errand of deep mystery. - I thought you might be interested. - Well, yes, I am. But how did you hear of it'? Erm, actually, I overheard it. The Dynamic Duo were to be dinner guests at stately Wayne Manor tonight. Now, their tricky mission -could concern you, Miss Gordon. - Me? Yes. It seems that, uh, Penguin his exploding umbrella and a rare book on parasols are involved. Thank you. I appreciate the tip, Alfred. And, as always, your secrecy. Charlie, I thought I was going to spend a quiet evening with you. Instead, I'm off to Glu Gluten's Glue Factory. NARRATOR". Once more, from Barbara Gordon, librarian and police commissioner's daughter to that dominoed daredoll Batgirl in a matter of seconds. Well, so I'll give up the purse. I can still keep the cash. - Parasol would win as the favorite. -Yes but favorites just pay peanuts. You know that, Lulu. Oh, wait a minute. What if Parasol wasn't the favorite? Wasn't? Yes, what if we had another horse that looked like Parasol and we put him in the same race? And then took my horse and a dab of paint and a new name We're working on the same wicked wavelength, huh, Lulu? Here, hold that a minute. - What's that? -It is a radio. I did a little research at the library and left a souvenir. I wanna see if it's exploded yet. Ha! - Exploded? -Yeah. You're still up to your naughty little tricks, aren't you? That's right. Come on, come on. And thus the Dynamic Duo really earned their name this afternoon when they successfully detonated a bomb ingeniously planted in an umbrella handle at the Gotham Library. And now for the-- The dynamic dunderheads. Faugh. Double faugh. Triple faugh. Why are you so anxious to bomb the library? No, not the library, somebody in the library. Somebody who had the miserable taste to turn down an offer of marriage from me. You, Pengy, scorned by a woman? -It's incredible, isn't it? -Yes. Well, let's get back to the horse-switching. Before those caped crumbums get on my tailpiece again. Hey, you feathered finks, let's go. NARRATOR". But even as the Dynamic Duo head for their dubious destination and Batgirl zooms through the night for her own surprise appearance in Glu Gluten's Glue Factory, Penguin and Lola are completing a deal. Or trying to. You're out of print, buddy. Dead as a dodo. - The parade has passed you by. -Faugh. Look, glue isn't made out of horses' hoofs anymore, you know. - Then what's that horse doing here? -Horse? Yes, this four-legged thing with a long nose. Oh, this horse. Well, you see, I always keep a spare one here just in case of an emergency. Well, We'd like to buy it. If you're not gonna use it for glue, how about making a deal? - What's the deal? -The usual. Nothing down and a little a week. Nothing down? What kind of a deal is that? Why, you're out of print, buddy. Dead as a dodo. The parade has passed you by. Don't you know anything about the economic structure of this country? It's always nothing down and a little a week. That is the cornerstone of our financial security. - How little a week? -Which week? They're making a deal in a glue factory for a horse. Mm. What can we do? What's illegal about buying a horse in a glue factory? Something, all right, or Penguin wouldn't be in on it. But planting a time bomb in a public library is a felony. Come on. Let's nail him. Drat. Double drat. Triple drat. - Expletives will get you nowhere. -Except back in the cooler. The cooler? Because I was conducting a little private business? No, because you've been misconducting some public business. Like bombing libraries. Faugh, that was a whimsical prank. What other whimsical pranks are you and your charming conspiratress up to? You do have a way with words, Batman. They wanna buy a horse. Senora Lola Lasagne, the owner of that fine filly, Parasol? - Well, you see, I-- -Cool it, Lulu. Now, grab that nag and paint a stripe on his forehead and make the switch at the track. I'll meet you back at the bookshop. Hey, I ain't got a deal. A deal? You've got a full house. Armband, Visor, you other finks, attack! Batman! Batman! Batman! Batman! Come along, little Pengy. Faugh, struck out by Batgirl. - Good show. -Gosh, Batman, they sure hit the tape. They certainly did, old chum. We usually don't need help with our fights, Batgirl. But this time your presence is certainly appreciated. Oh, thank you. I couldn't ask for a greater compliment. Oh, but the Penguin got away. I'm sorry. We'll get him back. I certainly hope so. I pray for the day when Gotham City's safe from such mocking mountebanks. Cleaning up crime is the dream of every good citizen, Batgirl. But one thought intrigues me. How did you know Robin and I might be in trouble with Penguin in this glue factory? Through the one thing you couldn't possibly have in your utility belt, Batman. A woman's intuition. What are we gonna do about these goons? I'd say their fate is sealed, Robin. At least for the present. Perhaps we should offer Batgirl a ride back to the ci-- She's gone. Like a shadow. Like smoke. Like a shooting star. Who knows where she goes? Who knows where she comes from? Who knows who she is? - Let's try to catch her. -No, Robin. We must allow her her anonymity and freedom of action as we demand ours. Whatever is fair in love and war is also fair in crime-fighting. And there's something Something very sinister about Penguin and Lulu Schultz trying to find another horse the same color as Parasol. To the Batcave. Nothing down, nothing a week. A nothing factory. What a deal. Courage, Robin. We'll get that slippery bird. Holy mucilage. Yes, Robin, things are getting even stickier. You pulled it off, Lulu. You switched bangtails at the track, and this hay burner is the real palooka. The real Parasol, Pengy. And I wish you wouldn't call her a bangtail, a hay burner or a palooka. And the refugee from the glue factory is in Parasol's stall, right? With a beautiful white stripe right down the middle of her forehead. I combined my pancake makeup, my eye shadow, my eyebrow pencil my lipstick, my nail polish and some elbow grease. Let's hope the elbow grease is the right color. Ha-ha! - Nobody got wise? -Of course not. After all, I am Senora Lola Lasagne. Besides, nobody saw me. That's right. Yes, yes, you're the great horse. We're gonna give you a nice new paint job and give you a nice name. What about Bumbershoot, huh? You'll be the most famous and richest long shot in history. - Ha! -Just one thing worries me, Pengy. How is our long shot gonna pay a big price if everybody bets on the other horse they think is Parasol? Because all our money will be on Bumbershoot. What money? Well, let's say Bumbershoot pays 100-to-1 that means we'll make $200 for a $2 ticket. - But that takes $2. -Yes, Lulu. And we should have $10,000 down on Bumbershoot. - That's a nice round figure. -But where's it all coming from? Don't you have any old family heirlooms you can pawn? I told you, Pengy, my old family heirloom divorced me. That's right. And you've sold all your priceless parasols, hm? They weren't as priceless as I thought. Priceless parasols. What about a priceless folio of famous parasols? Yeah, what about it? There's one at the library. If it's that priceless, I can get a good price for it on the black market. Ha-ha. And after all, you are in the book business. Well, sort of. Pengy you're a genius. -Yes. Go get it, right now. No, no. The library isn't open yet. Since when has that ever stopped you? That's right, it never has and it never will. I'll go there right now. You go and paint up Bumbershoot and I'll go and try to snatch a folio of famous, priceless parasols. NARRATOR". Is Lola right? Can't Penguin be stopped? Is he really stealing a priceless folio to finance his crooked coup with the Dynamic Duo pasted to the Batmobile outside the glue factory? And Barbara Gordon, minus Batgirl's trappings asleep in her apartment? Or is she? Dad, Barbara. I'm sorry to be calling you so early in the morning but the Emergency Library Prowler Signal just rang. I'm sorry we worried you, Alfred. But even the Batmobile's Library Paste Bat-dissolving Switch got stuck. Look, Batman, the red phone. NARRATOR". But are they all too late? Will Penguin and Lola succeed in pulling off the foulest race-fixing scheme of all time? For more, tune in the next episode. 
Batman In last night's Bat adventure we saw Gotham City dignitaries gather. An unveiling. A ghastly travesty. The Riddler at large again. Pandemonium. A riddle for a clue. A call for help. To the rescue. Riddle solved. On to the library. A ring of wax. A rare old book stolen. A strange discovery. It's a clue! Batman grabbed the gauntlet. Was it a trap? Watch out, Batman! Too late. Helpless. A fatal dip! And in just one bubbling minute. . But wait the most terrifying is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman Holy paraffin, Batman! This is going to be a close one. Too close. Oh, this is my dream come true. With you two out of the way there is nothing that stands between me and the lost treasure of the Inca's. And it's worth millions. Millions. Do you hear me, Batman? Remember, Riddler, you can't buy friends with money. With money who needs friends? Riddler, honey, these fumes are terrible. Can't we go below? I want to watch this to its glorious finale. Can't we watch it just as well from your candle-scope? Well, alright. The fumes are getting to me too. Huh! Keep smiling, you two. Remember, I'd like nice expressions on your faces when we deliver you to the wax museum. Bye. Let's go. They're going, Batman. They're going. Good. Now, to find a way out of this predicament. - Wait a minute. What's that? - Where? That barrel over there 'with a chemical formula written on it. ' 'I can't see all the formula' but unless I miss my guess that's the solution for treating candle wax. It's highly explosive when it's exposed to heat. I can't see how that's gonna do us much good. Matches, down scope. The candle scope is working beautifully. Oh, let me see, let me see. Alright. Just for a second. Oh, it does seem a shame. Moth. . if you expect to get anywhere in this arch criminal game you can't be soft. You must learn to control your emotions. Uh-oh! We're getting awfully close to that wax. Those fumes are getting pretty strong. Don't give up, Robin. Remember, where there's a will there's a way. If only we could ignite that barrel of chemical solution down there I feel certain it would blow us free. I don't know whether it'll work, but I think it's worth a try. I can't see what you're doing. There's a shaft of sunlight coming through the roof. If I can just twist around a little and reflect it in my highly polished belt buckle with a little bit of luck maybe I can direct it at the barrel. What are they doing up there? Something nearly blinded me. Let me take a look, boss. 'I don't see nothin' wrong, boss. ' Somethin' is awfully bright up there. Hmm. I think I've got the right angle now. Hold perfectly still. There. I'm right on the mark. Prepare yourself for the shock. What are they doing up there? Was that an explosion? Could the explosion have blown them to bits? Be still. . my throbbing heart. My fondest dreams come true. Batman and Robin dead. Dead! Dead! My cup runneth over. Up scope. Can we forget about them now and go find that lost treasure? Oh, let me savor this moment. So divine. Seeing Batman and Robin dead is more important than any treasure. More important than all those Incan baubles, bangles and beads? Not to me, it ain't! Impatience thy name is woman. First, I must call Commissioner Gordon and tell him the good news about his beloved caped crusaders and then confound him with a little riddle. Oh, why take time for that? Crime is no fun without riddles. I'll have you know that's the main reason I took up this crime game. All of you in the truck. Ain't you taking the Batmobile, boss? Would be too conspicuous where we're going. I'll be with you in a minute. Go on. Commissioner Gordon here. This is the Riddler. I have some news for you about the late dynamic duo. Late? I'm sorry to be the one to break this unfortunate news to you, commissioner. Batman and Robin dead? I can't believe it. 'If you had anything to do with this, Riddle' I'll track you down to the ends of the earth. And that's a solemn promise. While you're at it, commissioner ponder this riddle. What has four legs, runs day and night but never gets anywhere? Now, see here, you cheap scoundrel-- By the time you figure it out it'll be too late. Are you alright, Robin? Gosh! We were almost goners. Those guys mean business. It's a miracle we were blown free by that explosion. Let's just be thankful that my calculations were correct. I don't know how you do it. There's no time for that now. Good! They didn't take the Batmobile. I think we better call Commissioner Gordon. - Commissioner Gordon? - Who is this? - Why, this is Batman. - 'Batman!' Your caped crusader. Is something wrong? The Riddler said you were dead. Wishful thinking on his part. We're alive and raring to go. Well, I must say this is good news but back to business. What do you make of this clue the Riddler left? 'What has four legs, runs day and night' but never gets anywhere? That's the riddle. Word for word. We'll get on it right away, commissioner. What has four legs, runs day and night but never gets anywhere? This isn't going to be easy, Robin. - A river runs day and night. - Yes, but it gets somewhere. It runs to the ocean. But a fountain. It could be a fountain. I think you're on the right track, Robin. But that four legs business, that stumps me. An animal has four legs. Wait a minute. Maybe the fountain has an animal in it. The famous lion fountains in front of the Gotham City Museum? Gosh, Batman, I think you're wrong. The lion fountains aren't running at all. The water shortage remember? That's what that cheating devil wants us to think, Robin. I'm sure I'm right. And that's where the Riddler must be going and we must go without delay. Hold tight. How could a sarcophagus be so hard to find? Gee, boss, I don't even know what an esophagus looks like. You numbskull, you're no help to me here. You and Matches go upstairs. Keep a lookout. Sure, boss. Oh, Riddler, honey. . this place gives me a nice case of the jitters. What are all those nasty-looking things? Ooh. A few little fun things from the middle ages. . my little Moth. That tub there. That sweet little thing was called the maiden's bath. And this. . the exquisite iron mask. And this the beloved stocks. Oh. And that wheel over there. . that beautiful ingenious wheel of death. And last but not least the rack. Oh, those were the good old days. I'm sorry I asked. Is it possible this has some connection with the lost treasure of the Inca's? Aunt Harriet was reading about it this morning. It's in all the newspapers. They can't exhibit it until they build an airtight display case. If it's exposed to air, it will crumble to dust. It's beginning to make sense. The lost treasure of the Inca's must be hidden inside that sarcophagus. I'd stake my life on it. So that's what he learned from that old book. - I hope we're not too late. - So do I, Robin. The Riddler and his gang may be destroying one of the world's greatest archeological treasures and for a mere million dollars worth of jewels. It's locked. They must be closed today. How do we get in? Batman, look, that window. It's open, but it's too small. I'd never make it. But I could. I could, Batman. - It's dangerous. - Let me do it. I promise I'll come right down and open the door for you. - Please, Batman. - Be careful, Robin. Don't try to capture the Riddler and the gang by yourself. Come immediately downstairs and open the door for me. I'll handle it. Do you understand? - Roger. - Take your Bat-communicator. And keep in touch. Stand clear. Grab it. 'Keep in touch with me on your throat communicator. ' Golly, Batman, I hope we're not too late. I join you in that hope. I shudder to think how it might effect our foreign relations if anything happened to this exhibit. How do you mean, Batman? Can you imagine the reaction of our good neighbors to the south should we allow their national treasure to be destroyed? Gosh! I see what you mean. Take care, Robin. - You! I thought you were dead. - I'll show you how dead I am. Ow! Hey, Matches, give me a hand. I. . Ow! Now, you're making me mad, kid. Robin? Robin! Do you hear me? Is something wrong, Robin? Robin! Come in, Robin. - Hey, boss, look what we found. - Huh? - But you're dead. - No thanks to you that I'm not. And Batmanhe lives too? No, you fiend, you've destroyed the finest man that ever lived. And I'll get you for it. You pernicious pipsqueak. You're in no position to threaten anyone. Put him on the rack. If he doesn't fit, stretch him to size! But don't hurt him. Robin, if you can hear me I'm coming in after you. Commissioner, I'm at the Gotham City Museum. Robin's inside and I'm going in after him. You'd better send some men over. Right. You may think you have the upper hand now, but wait. Hey, boss, I think I found it. What? The sarcophagus? - Yeah, it's over here. - The sarcophagus! Just think, think. In a few short moments the vast treasure of the Incans shall be mine, mine! Ours, honey, ours. Who said you can't take it with you? Lucky for me the Incan emperor's dead. At least their jewels. Ooh, the sarcophagus! Oh, it's too bad Batman's dead. If only he could see me now. Ahh! Again it's Batman! It can't be. I saw you dead with my own eyes. You lied to me, Boy Wonder. A little white lie is excusable when dealing with the likes of you you black-hearted scoundrel. Well, don't just stand there. Get him, men! This is gonna hurt me more than it does you. Get him, Matches! Get him! I don't know about you, Riddler, honey but I'm gettin' out of here. Ooh! Alright, Riddler. Now, it's your turn. No, no. No. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - 'Batman. ' 'Batman. ' Holy smoke! The candle is still burning under the wax. Put it out before it eats through. Good thinking, Robin. Just in time. Watch out, Batman! Oh! Ah! Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with knives? Can we talk this over, Batman? Ah! Ooh! Let me give you one last word of advice. Give up your evil ways. When you've paid your debt to society and pay it you will start life anew as a respected citizen. I'll give you anything, anything you want. Just name it, Batman. Name it. Ahh! Ooh! Oh! Aww! Batman, that smarts. Ooh. Robin, are you alright? I'm just a little sore, Batman, that's all. Well, one of Aunt Harriet's good, nourishing meals will set everything right again. I sure worked up an appetite, I'll tell you that. You're all under arrest. Now, no monkey business. We got you covered. There's no need for guns, Chief O'Hara. There's no more fight left in them When Commissioner Gordon told me to go to the museum naturally, I thought he meant the wax museum. O-otherwise, we would've been here sooner. Anyone can make that mistake, Chief O'Hara. There's no harm done, chief. The Riddler and his accomplices are ready to be delivered into your capable hands. Oh, Batman, honey, Moth's learned her lesson. Really she has. Crime doesn't pay. Unfortunately, you learned your lesson too late, Moth. A moth that plays around candles is bound to be burned. Oh. Oh! Oh, Batman. You may have won the battle. . but the war isn't over yet. This is certainly a very educational way to spend an afternoon. Yes, and it's going to come in so handy at school. I think I'll do my end-of-term report on it. Very good. Most Americans don't realize what we owe to the ancient Incans. Very few appreciate that they gave us the white potato and many varieties of Indian corn. Now, whenever I eat mashed potatoes I, for one, will think of the Incans. Mercy alive! Have you ever seen such beautiful jewels? They must've cost a king's ransom. It says here that they found the jewels in a secret panel in the sarcophagus. They were hidden to guard against grave robbers who were very prevalent in olden days. Well, thank goodness we don't have anything like that to worry about today. Well, I think we should be leaving now. Oh, Bruce, I want just one more peak at this old Incan emperor. Will you look at that? Isn't he preserved nicely for all those thousands of years. It's remarkable. The old boy nearly didn't make it. Next week, Batman jousts with the Joker again. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman 
NARRATOR". When we last saw the Boy Wonder he was about to be printed into a horrible human comic book and Bruce Wayne was being forced to push the switch that would stamp Robin's doom. What way out? Frankly, this observer fears there's none. The answer in just one moment. NARRATOR". But on the street below the doomful scene, trusty Alfred per a Batman plan. Master Robin, Mr. Wayne, sir, do you read me? Do you read me, sir? Oh, dear. Bless my vertigo. Quick, my humorous robots, exert yourselves. Conclude this comical charade. Sorry, Boy Wonder I'm doing my very best against this infernal robot super-strength. Mr. Wayne, I know you're doing your best. - What the devil? -it's Batman. Unhand Mr. Wayne. Here comes the Batgas. Robots, now hear this: We who laugh and run away live to laugh another day. - Quickly, Alfred, the Batfan. - Very good, sir. - Well done, Alfred, and bravely too. -Ha, ha. You were great, Alfred. You even sounded like Batman. Small wonder, Master Robin. That was my own voice, Robin. Remember those lessons in ventriloquism? Gosh, yes. I should have thought of that. No, don't blame yourself, Robin. It's sometimes difficult to think clearly when you're strapped to a printing press. Joker and his bad luck gang escaped down that secret elevator. Who cares? Now we've got proof that Joker was back of that counterfeit operation. "Was" is right, Robin. I'm afraid all we've succeeded in doing here is frightening him into another criminal endeavor. -Any notion what that might be, sir? No, but I have an ugly hunch, Alfred. As part of my charade, I prepared a document appointing Joker as an officer of Gotham Bank. Unfortunately, in the ensuing melee he snatched the document and made off with it. - Holy bankruptcy. You don't mean--? -Alas I do, Robin. Under the alias of W. C. Whiteface Joker is now the legal vice chairman of the board of the Gotham National Bank. Look, he's got his criminal robots installed as tellers. Ominous indeed. Bruce Wayne is chairman of the board of this bank. Can he fire them? Regrettably not, Robin. Vice chairman has complete control of personnel according to the charter however we could not anticipate such a pass as this. Well now, it's Batman and Robin. - Good afternoon, Batman. -Good afternoon. And what can I do for you? Perhaps a small Batcave improvement loan? No, thank you. We're here in search of criminal activity. Ooh! Ha-ha-ha! That's priceless, priceless. Oh, the blind blundering bats are getting funnier and funnier. Anything amiss, Mr. Flamm? Nothing, Batman. Mr. Whiteface has this branch in apple pie order. Holy stomachache, some sour apple pie. Are you aware that your new tellers are actually a pair of robots? Oh, well, yes, I did suspect that but our customers find them positively charming and our mid-day audit was correct to the penny. Come on, Robin. That twisted mocking fiend. What's he up to? All too obvious, he's playing honest to set the stage for a criminal coup that will stagger our imaginations. -Sure, Batman, but what? That's a good question, Robin, I wish Wait a minute, here he comes with that deluded moll of his. If we play our cards right, perhaps we can cull a clue. Hello there, Mr. Pasty Whiteface, going somewhere? Ho, oh! Don't they wish they knew. We'd better follow them, Robin. From the look on his face, they're off to rob a church poor box. Why, you impertinent flying rodent Miss Miller and I are off to see my associate millionaire Bruce Wayne, on a most important matter. Ha! Well, well. It looks like we're getting closer to the heart of this criminal artichoke. - We could run him in, Batman. -What? Look at that crazy Joke-mobile. I bet it violates 50 sections of the Gotham State Vehicle Safety Code. Don't be foolish, Robin. Far better that we eavesdrop on his unscheduled meeting with millionaire Bruce Wayne. Let's go, Robin, no use hounding these innocent citizens. Let's take the Batmobile in for a safety check, shall we? You're right, Batman, it's long overdue. Good afternoon, sir. I hope it will be, Alfred. We're expecting callers. When they arrive, show no emotion, but usher them in. The next voice you hear will be your own, Mr. Wayne. Ha, ha. Remember? But, you see I foolishly succumbed to the temptation of speculation with the funds of the Wayne Foundation. The results were catastrophic. Tomorrow is the annual accounting and if I don't have - Stop at once. -Ho-ho-ho. Gosh, Bruce, how could you? Temptation, Dick. A sudden drop in the stock market a search for an easy way. It's ruined stronger men than myself. So, Mr. Whiteface, what's the point of your gloomy reprise? Blackmail, Mr. Wayne. You ungrateful devil. Isn't it enough that Bruce appointed you vice chairman of the bank? Don't dip your oar in this sordid sea, Dick. You might get besmirched. All right, it just burns me up. The filthy greed of some people. As you were saying, Mr. Whiteface? Imagine my ghastly situation, Mr. Wayne. Legally installed in the bank but watched like an insect by that infernal Caped Crusader. If I misappropriate a dime, the Bat will pounce. Yes, I can understand for someone of your dubious character that might prove annoying. Yes, my demands, Mr. Wayne: Unless you want that taped confession sent to the authorities you will lure the Dynamic Duo into a trap deliver me the lifeless corpse of Batman and the Boy Wonder. That is impossible. Bruce Wayne may be a crooked embezzler, but he's not a killer. - Right, Bruce? -You phrase it well, Dick. Since the murder of my parents by dastardly criminals violence has been anathema to me. We've been foiled, Joker. - That guy's a milksop. -Uh-huh. Very well then, we must be content with our humorous alternate plan B. - Plan B? -Plan B? Oh, Brucie pie, yes, yes, yes! I beg your pardon? Oh, you're a lucky chap, Mr. Wayne. Ha-ha-ha! My pretty protÃ©gÃ©, Miss Miller, has just consented to marry you. I'll be faithful forever in my fashion. I'll love you until the oceans are hung up and dried. Oh, and by the way, here is the marriage contract. Oh, let me commend you on your generosity. The initial settlement is 3 million dollars. Hello, society editor? This is Mr. Whiteface of the Gotham National Bank. Yeah. I have an announcement which might be of interest. Oh, darling, you're yummy. Read all about it. Millionaire Bruce Wayne to wed reformed gun moll. Banker's pretty protÃ©gÃ©. Extra, extra, read all about it. Monstrous. - This alliance all but beggars belief. -Saints preserve us. And the bride has a record longer than both my arms and both my legs stitched end to end. What's on your mind? Batman, have you read the dire news about Bruce Wayne? Love is blind, commissioner. Bruce Wayne is over 21. I fear there is nothing we can do. She's a fetching creature, Robin. Bruce might find it not without certain pleasures. Holy madness, Batman, I don't dig this. Bruce Wayne didn't embezzle, that was just a ploy. Joker's blackmail threat isn't worth a tinker's darn. Yes and no, Robin. The way I set the caper up I'm afraid I couldn't explain that tape without compromising our secret true identities. Gosh, yes. Ouch, I hadn't thought of that. Luckily for us, however, there's one weak link in this criminal chain. - Where? -Think, Robin, think. Rehearse this curious affair from the very beginning. You should see one gigantic foothold which we haven't even laid a hand on. A foothold we haven't laid a hand on? - Gosh, you have me buffaloed, Batman. - I'll give you a hint, Robin. Our secret weapon is a dead stranger in this Batcave. Dead stranger in this - Holy remote-control robot. -Exactly, Robin. Joker's Mr. Glee, whom we captured earlier in this adventure. If we could just solve the secret of his control mechanism we'd have the other two robots dancing in our control. NARRATOR". Watch out, Bruce Wayne, for as the Caped Crusaders toil a strange meeting takes place in Commissioner Gordon's office. - Well, Dr. Floyd? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's no doubt, from the symptoms you describe me "Bruce Wayne is victim from the well-known second childhood syndrome. Sufficiently so to commit him to some mental institution? Yeah, yeah, yeah, naturally. One other vital point, doctor. How long would you say Mr. Wayne has suffered from this condition? Well, uh, the incubation period is slow. Perhaps three months, surely not less than two. - Saints be praised. -Yes, Chief O'Hara, we're free to act. Wayne was definitely mentally incompetent when he appointed the Joker to his bank. So, uh, what do we do? We have no choice. The poor fellow's irrational behavior threatens the entire financial structure of Gotham City. - Chief O'Hara? -Yes, sir. Alert your Anti-lunatic Squad. If Batman won't help us, we'll do it ourselves. Bring in millionaire Bruce Wayne in a straitjacket. Yes, sir. Well, I think we have his wavelengths analyzed. Shall we give it a spin? - Ready, Robin? -Ready. Mr. Glee, in the name of justice, I summon you back to life. Rise, please. Holy Frankenstein, we've done it. Now the fun begins, Robin. With Joker's nasty robots at our command, we'll-- - Alfred here. - Yes, Alfred? It's Chief O'Hara, sir. He wishes to see Mr. Wayne on a matter of urgency. Tell him to wait, Alfred. I'll be right back, Robin. Meanwhile, here's the plan. - Hello, chief. -Wrap him up, boys. - Chief O'Hara, what's the meaning of this? -it's a court order, Mr. Wayne. Don't worry, you'll have a nice long rest in Happy Acres. Come on, boys. I'm a personal friend of Commissioner Gordon! What? Bruce taken off in a straitjacket? I observed it myself, Master Robin. Holy stewpot, and I've just transmitted Batman's orders to those robots at the bank. -indeed. - This blow does seem ill-timed. -We haven't a minute to lose. - Quick, Alfred, put on your trusty Batman suit. -Roger. I believe that's them ahead, Master Robin. It's them, all right. First I'll give that wagon a little touch of Batray. - Good shot, Master Robin. -Thanks, Alfred. Now for the super-powered Batmagnet. With any luck, we'll latch onto the metal buckles of that straitjacket. - Good thinking. -Are you okay? Yes, I rolled with the fall. Now get me out of this overly tailored jacket. - Your spare Batsuit, sir. -Thank you, Alfred. I'll be back in a moment. Quickly, Robin, to the Batmobile. The medical findings, my dear Mr. Whiteface. Bruce Wayne was not of sound mind when he appointed you to this position. - Vacate these premises at once. -Fraud, frame-up! Joker, never mind, we've still got me and Brucie. Hey- My dear wife, Josephine, I've been looking for you everywhere. So that's your game, aiding and abetting attempted bigamy. Holy wedding cake, wait till we tell Bruce Wayne. - You creep, I'm not your wife. -What? Have you forgotten our honeymoon at Niagara Falls? Oh, boy, he's following our secret orders perfectly. Why, you mechanical moron, what's gotten into you? Help, stick-up! Empty your purse, madam. Hand me the contents. Your wallet, sir, or a bullet between your eyes. What is this madness? Am I dreaming? Joker, our robots must be getting orders from someplace else. - Ooh. -Don't look at us, Joker. We just dropped in for that small Batcave improvement loan that you mentioned but in view of the strange criminal activity that seems to be transpiring here - Let's rack them up, Batman. -Good idea, Robin. Robots, Boff and Yock and Glee, reprogram, ignore all previous instructions. Get the Dynamic Duo. Wow, we're double-crossed. That's the trouble with robots, Robin. They lack even the most minimal sense of loyalty. Now let's conclude this ugly little charade, shall we, Robin? Get them. Ugh. Where am I? You're about to start a journey you should know well by now, Joker: up the river. Here's the biggest joke. It was all a bluff, Joker. We didn't have one darn thing on you until you ordered those robots to try to kill us. Fantastic, Boy Wonder, what incredible brain work. Batman, if ever you see Bruce Wayne, tell him Tell him it might have been fun. I'll tell him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, stand clear, everyone. I declare Herr Wayne's mental recovery is complete. Capital. Uh, without doubt, the bump on the head when he accidentally fell from the paddy wagon restored him among us sane peoples. - Thank you very much, doctor. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. If only I could make a similar examination of the head from the Fledermaus Mensch. - The what? -The Fledermaus Mensch. How's your German, Dick? Fledermaus Mensch. - Why, that's German for Batman. -Right you are, old chum. What wonders there must be in the Fledermaus Mensch 's head. Oh, I don't know. Oh, come now, Bruce, don't joke. The brain of Batman, oh, miraculous. I'll make you a bet, doctor. If you were to have the opportunity to study Batman's brain with all its myriad flaws I think you'd find it not terribly unlike my own. Mother of mercy, get the smelling salts. Mr. Wayne is having a relapse. 
NARRATOR". So far, we have seen: Ma Parker come to town Batman and Robin call a little old lady surrender treachery capture of Pretty Boy Parker Machine Gun Parker caught Mad Dog catchers Legs give UP--- . . . wheelchair whiz the Parkers in the pen deception Ma take over engine of destruction. On the road. Going on 60. Was the Batmobile blasted? Boy Wonder bombed? Batman blown to bits? Better not budge. That's right, warden. When the Batmobile's speedometer hits 60, that's the end of Batman and Robin. Gosh, I'm hungry. I hope Aunt Harriet has a good meal waiting. Let's go faster. You see that sign, Robin? "Speed limit, 55 miles an hour. " A good driver always observes the speed laws. It's the best way to stay out of trouble. You're right. What worries me is what that trustee said. What was that? That Warden Crichton does 70 miles per hour on this road. The warden wouldn't break the speed laws. Maybe he wanted us to drive faster. Maybe he wasn't just looking at the Batmobile engine. Just as I thought, dynamite. There, that was it. We've just dynamited the dynamic duo. Now there won't be any interference with my plans. We got everything here we need: The personnel, the talent, the weapons and the perfect hideout. -Hideout? Sure. When we start pulling our jobs who'll think of looking for the culprits in the penitentiary? Heaven help us. It might work. Sure, it's gonna work. And you know why, warden? Because the pen is mightier than the sword. Ma, you're a riot. Yeah, a prison riot. All right. Now let's get down to business. Legs, you go take down those curtains. Oh, Ma, why take them down? They make the place look real nice. Whoever heard of a warden's office looking nice? I want everything here to look business-like and functional. - When did you learn them words? -Never mind. We're gonna save the homey touches for the cell block. Now, I wanna talk to that cook about the chow. We serve the best food in the penal system. Maybe so, warden. But from now on, every night is gonna be steak and potato night. - Oh, yeah! -Yeah! When we've got this place policed up real good we'll start getting down to real business. Yeah! Why would a trustee put dynamite in the Batmobile, Robin? He certainly isn't someone you could trust. A prison is full of social outcasts, Robin. Some of them seeking revenge, and one can hardly blame them. Maybe one of the prisoners put him up to it. - Maybe even Ma Parker. -Mm. - What next, Batman? -We're heading back. Sorry to disturb you again, warden but I wanted to make sure everything was all right. Why, of course everything is all right. Why shouldn't it be? I note some changes in your office decor. It seems a trifle drab. It's, uh, just being renovated. And someone almost renovated the Batmobile with dynamite. That's why we're worried. Probably an unfortunate mistake. Still, I can't help thinking that Ma Parker had something to do with it. Why,nonsense. I can show you that Ma Parker is safely put away. Oh. You see, snug as a bug, Batman. You're keeping Ma Parker and her daughter in the same cell block with the boys? Uh, yes, it-- it's what I call my family plan, Batman. It's my theory that the family that dorms together, reforms together. Let's see the children. Mm-hm. There, you see'? Everything is fine, Batman. Thank you, warden. Everything looks A-okay. All right, Robin. Let's go. Nice work, warden. One peep out of you and it would have been curtains for Batman and Robin. This is certainly a black day for Gotham City. All right, you, open these here doors now. Not that way, Knucklehead. These doors only open and close electrically. Pull the master switch. Now, boys, you listen to me and you listen to me good. It's taken me months to organize this here little party and now we are in business. We got everything we need right here. But most of all, we got some of the top talent in the country. Oh, it's true, boys. Most of you were brought in by Batman and the Caped Crusader only deals with top-echelon talent. What about The Penguin and the Joker? They're still in solitary. They can just cool off there until they find out who's number one around here. How do we make sure Batman won't spoil everything? Don't you worry about Batman, Catwoman. Batman and Robin can't hurt us now. They can only help us. Help us? How? Because the dynamic duo won't bother with us. - We're already in prison. Ha, ha. -Ha, ha. That's right. All they'll be doing is rounding up other criminals. More talent for the Gotham State Pen gang. Oh, that's beautiful. It's almost poetic. The harder they work, the more they'll help us. So I say, long live Batman and Robin! Batman, you really think there's something wrong with the crime computer? Something's wrong, but I don't know whether it's the crime computer or me. But everything worked out swell. Wham! We got Pretty Boy, Machine Gun, Mad Dog. Zap! We got Legs and Ma Parker. It was the easiest job we ever did. That's just it, Robin. It was too easy. Commissioner Gordon said that Ma Parker was the most dangerous adversary we've ever faced. Yet she played right into our hands. I have the strangest feeling we've been duped. Big shipment today, Mickey. Half a million dollars in cash. All right, you men, let's have that cash! Our aim's bad enough. Theirs is worse. Four guns, they can't even hit this truck. All right, Tiger, give them a bomb. - What was that? -The seismograph. The needle jumped. - There's an earthquake in Gotham City? -It didn't register a blast of that intensity. But it does mean there's been an explosion in the vicinity of the Gotham City National Bank. Back! Get back! Back! - Back, back. Back. -Get back. Get back. - Get back. -Batman. - What are we gonna do now, Ma? - I'll tell you what, let's buy them off. - Huh? -Here! Come on, get out of the way! Move! Get out of my way! Citizens, citizens, please. Let us through. Let us through. This is official business. Please, citizens, let me by. - They got away, Batman. -Yes, thanks to all that interference. - I wonder who they were. -I don't know. But the last one left us a souvenir. Mm. Just as I thought, Robin. There's no doubt about it. Just looks like a piece of ripped sleeve to me. Ripped prison cloth. One of the criminals must be an escaped convict from the Gotham State Penitentiary. Holy jailbreak. We haven't heard of an escaped prisoner, have we? I suspect there may be a number of things we haven't heard about. Let's call Warden Crichton to see if we can get some additional information. I wish you'd let me go with you, Ma. It's dull just being left behind in prison. Legs, I don't think it's gonna be dull much longer. Don't answer it. Hand me that extension, Machine Gun. Hello? This is Batman, Warden Crichton. Do you know anything about an escaped prisoner? Escaped prisoner? It's that meddling Caped Crusader. Go tell him to take a bat jump in Gotham Lake. Warden Crichton -is there something wrong? - Yes, there's plenty wrong. Ma Parker has taken over the prison. She and her boys-- Warden Crichton! There's trouble at the penitentiary, Robin, and Ma Parker must be behind it. You think she's trying to break out of jail? I don't know. But this is time for us to try to break in. Stand clear. Hold it. Hold it. There's easier ways to getting in here, like robbing a bank. - We'd hoped our arrival would go unnoticed. -Yeah, well, I noticed it. I guess I'm gonna have to shoot you, both of you. Instructions from Ma Parker? Yeah, she left orders. She said anyone can get out, but no one can get in. Sorry. - What a shame, Left. -What do you mean? - Jeopardizing your entire future? -Jeopardizing? Only 48 more years before your parole. Gee, I never thought of that. Forty-eight more years and I'm a free man. BOY- A wise decision. You won't regret this, citizen. - We've gotten this far, now what? -Try to cross the yard without being spotted. You've been spotted, Batman. Hello, Kelly. Nice to see you. Warden Crichton tells me you're doing a fine job. He does? Well, welcome to the pen. Let's take them to Ma. Here you are, Ma, a present. Well, well, well. At last, Batman and Robin in my power. Boys, I think the dynamic duo look hungry and tired. Let's give them a good supper and then find them a comfortable chair. - You feeling nice and comfortable, Batman? -Very. The dinner was excellent. My compliments to the chef. And I do appreciate your not rushing us. Well, I also have some time to kill. Until midnight, you mean? You savvy, Batman. Why midnight, Ma? Why not right now? Mad Dog, Gotham City will be sound asleep by midnight and nobody will notice the extra drain on the power. Mama always knows best. Be careful of those straps, fellas. They're connected to the electrical circuit. Let's get going. boys- There's a couple of last-minute odds and ends I gotta attend to. Legs, you stay here. Even a girl ought to be able to watch those two now. Holy rheostat. Look at the time. I know, Robin. He who hath life hath time. A proverb worth remembering. Legs? What's a nice girl like you doing in a situation like this? I'm as good as any boy, even if Ma doesn't think so. It does seem a little unfair. Girls are more sensitive, have more brain. You can say that again. And you weren't fooled for a minute, were you? When Ma left you here with us even though we can't get away? Wasn't I? L-- I mean, did she? Well, why? I have a suspicion, Legs that Ma and the boys have something else cooking. Something they maybe didn't want you to know about. Well, they can't pull that one over on me. What's that all about? A psychological experiment, Robin, and it worked. Now, if I can just break this wire and make contact with the Transistorized Shortwave Bat-transmitter in my Utility Belt. But that only connects to the receiver in the Batcave. That's right, Robin. If I can just send a signal to Alfred. We don't have any power source. The power is in this chair itself. If I can just break this wire loose. Now, to send a message in bat-code. Ahem. Yes, Madam? Alfred, I know Bruce's study is his private domain, but those sounds He's having some work done on the wiring, madam. - A new television unit, I believe. -Oh. Well, don't tell him I was curious, will you, Alfred? You think you got through, Batman? I don't know, Robin. Oh, now look at the time. It's almost midnight, Ma. I know, Mad Dog. You let your mother handle this. - Oh, no, Ma, I wanna do it. -No, me. - No way. -Quiet! Quiet, quiet! Ma Parker, I don't care about myself. But in the name of decency, I ask you to spare the life of Robin. Very, very touching. Something must've gone wrong with the electricity. - I guess the power failed. -I can't see, Ma. All right. Why don't you light a match? - Here you are, Ma. -Batman's loose! Get him, get him. - Are you all right, Robin? -I've never felt better, Batman. I noticed an emergency generator switch here-- Yes, there it is. Wow, these infrared eyeglasses really worked, Batman. - I could see perfectly in the dark. -Yes, they came in handy. - I still don't understand what happened. -Simple. The message I gave to Alfred was have Gotham City Electric Company shut off the power at precisely midnight. Holy Edison. You're a wiz, Batman. But what about all the loose convicts out there? Snug in their cells. The doors open and close electrically. When the power was shut off, they were locked in. Well, Ma, I hope you've learned your lesson at last. Have pity, Batman, on a poor mother. I didn't mean any harm. I was just trying to make my children happy. Look out, Batman! Looking for this, Ma? I took the precaution of removing it from your hair during the fight. You're very clever, Batman. It isn't easy to foil the greatest mother of them all. Once again we're in your debt, Caped Crusaders. Just doing our job, commissioner, and with some reluctance. Committing a mother and her four children to prison is not a pleasant assignment. Even Ma Parker. Anyway, you'd better make sure that she and her progeny are safely tucked away. For some time to come, Batman. - What's that, warden? -No need for alarm, Batman. That's merely the call to Sunday chapel service. Oh. Excuse me, warden. Yes, what is it, Riley? This package just arrived for Ma Parker. I thought you'd better see it first. Careful, warden, you know her tricks. Yes. It might be some more dynamite. Let me see that, warden. It was ordered on your telephone, warden, by her four children when they had control of the prison. Easy, Batman. I don't think there's any danger, Robin. Flowers, gentlemen. Do you know what day this is? - What day? -Mother's Day. 
We have already seen icy pavements in July. Shivers! It must be. . Mr. Freeze strikes again. He's after big ice cubes. He cooled the guard. He gave everybody the slip. Will the real Batman please stand up. Curses! Foiled again! But wait! A new clue. A princess in distress. The dynamic duo to the rescue. Blow hot! Blow cold. Horrors! Frozen stiff. But wait. The most chilling is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman, Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na Na-na na-na na-na Batman Midnight, in the super hypotherm deicefyer chamber mark 7 of the Gotham City Hospital two lonely figures lie quiet. Peaceful. Serene. Instant freezing. - Deadly! - Oh! If I could only get me mitts on that dastardly Mr. Freeze. . Patience, O'Hara. No public official elected by the people can allow his emotions to overrule his dedication to duty. And carrying out the due process of law. - Is there a chance? - What do you want? Miracles? I'm doin' the best I can. The best I can do. - And that's all I can do. - Easy, now, Vince. This has been tough on all of us. If I can just raise their body temperature, gradually enough. There's an outside chance, but it's tricky. One degree too muchtoo soon. It'll be a long and worrisome vigil, I fear. Two such magnificent specimens of manhood. Why? - The saints be praised! - Look! We interrupt our regular program to repeat this earlier bulletin. Batman and Robin are alive. Repeat, are alive. 'After the almost fatal and most mysterious attack' 'on them last night. ' The dynamic duo were instantly frozen by an unknown assailant who robbed Princess Sandra escaping with the famed Ghiaccio Circulo diamond. 'The would-be killer is still at large. ' 'And now, back to Gotham City stadium for the ceremonies' 'preceding today's game between the Eagles' 'and the Windy City Wildcats. ' - Uh, Boss. - Come in, Mole. I-I can't. Oh, I'm sorry. How did it go? Operation Big Diamond accomplished. - Good. - Where do you want it? In here where I can see it. And tell airplane to zoom-zoom-zoom. Right, boss. Ah, Batman, you still live. But only for a short time. I now have the most precious diamond of all in my possession. And to get it back, you must die. Die! Die! 'From Bruce Wayne's private box in Gotham City's new stadium. ' 'Princess Sandra of Molino is getting ready to toss out' 'the first ball at this great charity game between' 'the two deadliest rivals in any baseball league. ' 'It's a beautiful day. A b-eautiful day. ' 'But no more beautiful than the lovely princess herself. ' May I? Well, I'm-I'm sure I can't pitch like your great Paul Diamante but, why, I do have a few curves. Play ball. Oh, I'm so excited. And part of it is seeing you again. I'm just sorry the circumstances couldn't have been more favorable. Losing the Ghiaccio Circulo diamond last night. Oh, that. Well, just be thankful that my servant and those two simply magnificent creatures, Batman and Robin are still alive. I'd give anything to meet them someday. - Socially, of course. - Perhaps you may. . someday. I'm dying to watch Paul Diamante pitch. Is he really as good as they say? Better! Like real cool, ma'am. . I mean, Your Royal Highness. 'Attention, your attention, please. ' 'Change in the line-up. ' 'Pitcher for the Gotham City Eagles, number 77' 'Denny Allen for Paul Diamante. ' 'Apparently, Paul Diamante is. . ' 'Well, we're not sure what happened. ' I don't understand. I'm beginning to. Diamante means diamond in Spanish. Mr. Freeze. I thought Batman was out of danger. What does this mean? Uh, if you'll excuse us, princess. I'm sorry. I've forgotten that we have a board meeting at the Bruce Wayne Foundation scheduled for this afternoon. Can't miss a board meeting. Well, I never. . Our only clue. According to Diamante's landlady These three rather disreputable men visited Diamante's apartment this morning. When she up to clean the apartment . . no Diamante, only this note. "You will soon hear my terms. " That's all? - And this. - Mr. Freeze. Who else? Afraid you're right. Commissioner Gordon speaking. 'Ah-ha-ha, commissioner. You still there?' We're all here, listening. Chief O'Hara, Batman, Robin. 'Batman, perfect. Absolutely perfect. ' 'You are there and I am here with your most precious diamond' 'from the baseball diamond. ' 'Clever, yeah? Diamond from the diamond. ' - 'Speak to them. ' - 'This is Paul Diamante. ' 'This kookie character has me holed up out here' 'in the wildest pad. ' - Where, Paul? Where? - 'Who knows where?' 'Some creeps chloroformed me this morning, brought me here. ' - Mr. Freeze. - 'Yeah. ' How much do you want for Diamante's release? 'How much I want? Ha ha ha. ' 'Nothing, not one single mark. ' 'I mean, uh, cent. ' - 'No money. None. ' - Then what? 'Simple, very simple. ' 'I will trade even. One baseball pitcherfor. . ' 'one Batman. ' Absolutely out of the question. As protector of our city, I cannot allow you to deliberately jeopardize your very life. Over me dead body you'll go. Sorry, Diamante is the idol of millions of impressionable young lads who look up to him. He must live to inspire the youth of today who will be the men of tomorrow. I accept your terms. Where and when do we meet? 'Alone?' Alone. You may speak freely. No one's listening in. I'll be there. Robin, this is one time I'll have to go out alone. I gave my word. A hot flash for the chilly Mr. Freeze. Will Robin just stand by? If Muhammad won't come to the mountain, Master Dick the mountain must come to Muhammad. Time for afternoon tea. Holy interruptions. Who has time for afternoon tea at a time like this? Wellington did. Even at Waterloo. Well, I suppose a little extra energy wouldn't hurt. - Uh, where's Mister Bruce? - There. What? I secretly planted a homing device on him. Secretly? Master Dick, am I to understand that you've been shadowing the master without his knowledge or approval? Holy Sherlock Holmes. How can I help him if I don't know where he is? - He's in danger then. - Plenty. - Where? - There. Right in the middle of nowhere. You okay, Paul? Take it easy. I think so. Batman? Take it easy. I'm prepared to fulfill my part of the bargain. Do with me what you will. Mr. Diamante, you A-okay? What happened? Robin, the boy wonder. Take it easy. They've got Batman. I've been following 'em. I secretly planted a homing device on him. Watch that pitching arm. Later, in the super refrigerated hideout of Mr. Freeze Batman is gradually recovering after the cowardly attack behind his back. My utility belt. Is this what you're looking for? Very ingenious, this utility belt. Bat-rope, Bat-arang, explosives gas pellets and other things. Such imagination. A most useful thing to have. When you have it. If I were you, Batman I would not try to move from your nice heated area. It is not only foolish to go from a nice warm to a 50 degree below zero temperature. It is also very dangerous to the system. You see, even through your glove the cold air penetrates like a thousand needles. Am I not right? - I am right. - You're right, you cold fish. What next? That depends. It depends, uh. . Ultimately of course, you will die, but how, when, where. Mercilessly fast or agonizingly slow. - Depends. - Depends on what? - On you. - Me? And me. On how you act and how I feel when the time comes. I-It depends. You fool. You fool! I warned you against sudden changes in temperature. The air freezing your lungs. Yeah? Cold, frigid, frosty air freezing your lungs solid like icicle. Now you know how I fell when the air is warm and I cannot breathe like you cannot now. You are freezing, yeah? If I choose I can make you freeze to death. But not yet. Not yet. You must not die too easy. Now. Press a button. Nice warm 76 degrees temperature. With this, I control your every move. I can decide where you can go and where you cannot go. Now, you follow nice hot path to dining room. Did I forget to mention that we have another guest for dinner? Somebody who just decided to drop in. Come-come, you two. You've scarcely said two words to each other the whole meal. What's the matter? You don't like me roast beef? Oh, I know. It's the spinach. Let the boy go. He's never done you harm. His only crime was disobeying my order not to fallow me by planting that homing device on me. You have my deepest sympathy, Batman. Unfortunately, the boy now knows this hideout so what can I do? Ah, Baked Alaska. My favorite dessert. We will have with it, uh, some of this very special liqueur. Chilled ever so slightly. Uh, 10 seconds in my hands. . cools it properly. Uh, 30 seconds for champagne, and one minute for martini. - Nice and cold. - None for me, thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you do not drink. Then have your Baked Alaska. You know, in some ways I-I'm so sorry that I have to destroy such charming people. - It is a great pity. - Mr. Freeze. . give yourself up. We can get help for you. Medical help. In prison? This I do not believe. 'No, you must pay for what you did to me. ' For forcing me to live like this. Never again to know the warmth of a summer breeze. Never to feel the heat of burning logs in winter time. Revenge. That is what I need. Revenge! I will have revenge! Now! Batman! The cold! Sorry, slipped on the Baked Alaska. You tried. That's the true measure of a man. Whether you win or lose, to try. And now, you will know what it feels like to freeze to death. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Ha ha ha. Charming, isn't it? Yeah, very charmed. Now, I press the button and there's only room for one. - Stay! - No, Batman. That's an order, boy. This is fun. Now, Robin will be able to watch you die first. Batman. . In a few seconds you will not be able to move at all. Now, tell me, Batman, how does it feel? How does it feel to freeze to death? Right, on the button. Turnabout is fair play. Naturally, you didn't know I was wearing my special super thermal B-long underwear for extreme cold. You mean, you pretended to freeze? It'll be a colder day than 50 below zero before you beat Batman, Mr. Freeze. Help me! Help me! Freeze him an area jail cell size. That should hold him till we get to the cooler. Batman! Up! Up, up! The guns, drop them. No-no! Wait, wait! Back to the cooler, Dr. Shivel. Now, gentlemen. Two against three. I'd say the odds are even. Ah! This is. . What took you so long? I phoned you before I came in here an hour ago. We took a wrong turn off route 49. 'Say "cheese. "' Oh, get hip. Not cheese. Mr. Freeze. Alright, one more, one more. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Well, commissioner. . Bruce. Oh, you old stick-in-the-muds. Off to a silly board meeting in the middle of a baseball game. How could you? Work before pleasure, princess. How do you feel after your ordeal, Paul? Great! Feel like pitching tomorrow. We can sure use you, especially against those Motor City wheels. Oh, I wish Batman and Robin could've been here. I would love to have thanked them personally for this. And for this. On behalf of all the loyal Gotham city fans of course. Oh, there you are, boys. You're just in time for the dessert. Gabriel, bring it in. Baked Alaska! Next week, Batman versus Zelda the Great. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman, Batman Batman Batman, Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman 
NARRATOR". Another sparkling day in Gotham City. Look sharp, O'Toole. With the Queen of Diamonds back in town, we've gotta be on our toes. Look up, O'Rourke. The diamond-dizzy dame has been after the Pretzel Diamond for years. She's bound to make a go for it. Goldberg, look alive. Chief O'Hara's instructions were to stop the Queen of Diamonds no matter what the cost. - Chief O'Hara. -At ease, O'Leary. Any trouble in here? No, chief. Everything's fine. - The Pretzel Diamond's still in there, is it? -Yes, sir. That's all I wanted to know. The Queen of Diamonds. Thank you, darling. You're doing very well so far. All I ask is the chance to be near you, Marsha. To bask in the light of your adorable presence. Yes, yes, darling, later. Right now the diamond, remember? Of course, my dear. Uh, oh. Bring your men and follow me. Yes, chief. O'Toole, O'Rourke, Goldberg, follow me. The Queen of Diamonds. That's enough of that. Don't you recognize me? Why, it's Chief O'Hara. And she's-- She's No guided tours today, darling. Chief, darling, the diamond. Oh, yes, my dear. - Bring us the Pretzel Diamond. -But-- Or perhaps you want to be arrested for obstructing the law. There, my lovely. Now you can't doubt my sincerity. This is proof of my devotion. It's a start. Alas, 'tis a pale thing beside your own beauty. Let's take the rock and let the rhetoric go, shall we, darling? Do you have a bag? O'Leary, see that these two don't make any trouble. Yes, chief. Anything you want in Gotham City is yours, my lovely. Take my life. Take my love. Take my all. Do be careful, sir. There's no danger with the power off, Alfred. - You think we'll have to replace it, Batman? -I certainly hope not, Robin. There. You may turn the power on, Alfred. - Yes, I think it's going to work now. -Lucky for us. It takes six months to manufacture another Bat-diamond that big even with a giant hydraulic Bat-press. Yes, it would be difficult, especially since, for our purposes it has to be far more pure than a natural diamond. One moment, commissioner. -It's Commissioner Gordon, sir. - I'll take it on the Bat-extension up here, Alfred. Yes, commissioner. Well, there must be some mistake. We've all known Chief O'Hara for years. He'd never-- I see. The Queen of Diamonds. Yes, it is serious. Perhaps far more serious than any of us yet realize. We'll be right down, commissioner. What's wrong with Chief O'Hara? That, Robin, is a question I hope we'll be able to answer. That's right, commissioner. Good bye. Was that all right? Did I do it right? Just fine, darling. You're not going to keep me in here, are you, my love? Just for a little while. Please, let me be near you. I don't mind the cage, as long as it's near you. Don't worry, darling. I'll visit you once a week. Please, Marsha, it's too cruel. Don't go, Marsha. Don't go, Marsha. It isn't fair, Marsha. Stay near us, Marsha. Marsha, please, come back. - Marsha! Marsha! - Come back! Your report, Grand Mogul. The usual, Your Highness. One of your admirers attempted suicide as proof of his devotion. He threw himself into an automatic dryer and tried to tumble himself to death, but failed. How boring. What have you found out about the Bat-diamond? We have ascertained that the Bat-diamond is used as a power source for the Batcomputer. It is well over 10,000 carats in size. Magnificent. Where is it kept? In the Batcave, Your Highness. - But no one knows where the Batcave is. -I will know where the Batcave is. In fact, I will be inside the Batcave once I've sprung my little trap. Is Cupid loaded? I will attend to that now, Your Highness. Be quick about it. We're expecting a guest. Ready, Your Highness. Good, good. Now Cupid will plant his little arrow where it'll do the most good. Holy Houdini, where's the commissioner? I don't know, Robin, but it's not like him. He knew we were coming. Looks like Queen of Diamonds is dealing from the bottom of the deck. I'm afraid you may be right. But all we can do is wait till we hear from him and hope that he's not walking into a trap. Where is Chief O'Hara? What have you done with him, you diabolical Mata Hari? If you've harmed a hair on O'Hara's head I'll have you in jail for the rest of your life. -Don't be tiresome, darling. Here, sit down next to me and relax. Your hanky-panky won't work with me, young lady. I want O'Hara. You don't find me the least bit attractive? Your charms are useless, you evil temptress. I'm not gonna dance to your little tune. Really? My only concern is Chief O'Hara. Where is he? Ooh. Oh. Oh, my Oh, my You are my only concern, Marsha. You beautiful creature. I'm yours to command. That's better, darling. Tell me more. Commissioner Gordon's office. Yes, commissioner, we'll be right there. Don't worry. The Queen of Diamonds has added Commissioner Gordon to her list. Holy hypnotism, what are we getting ourselves into? I don't know, Robin, but with Chief O'Hara and Commissioner Gordon in her clutches we have no choice. Now, don't be difficult, commissioner, darling. Don't leave me, Marsha. I just want to gaze at your beauty. I'll do anything. I'll roll myself into a ball, you can use me as your footstool. Just don't ever leave me. I'm sorry, darling. I have to pay a visit to my dear old Aunt Hilda in the basement. She's mine. Mine. Never, O' Hara! She's mine! - Come back, Marsha! -Come back, Marsha! Double, double, toil and trouble. Bubble, bubble. Ah. Ha-ha-ha. A notion, a potion, for making a commotion. Ha-ha-ha. I have a potion that will do anything you want it to. Really, Aunt Hilda? Don't you think you're carrying this thing a bit too far? Can't you let an old lady have a little fun? You go right ahead, darling, and have all the fun you want to just as long as your potions keep getting results. Remember, I was a chemistry professor at Vassar for 20 years, deary. I remember. I also remember they fired you. Yes, I tried one of my potions in the college cafeteria. And it turned the entire student body orange for a week. That was before I completed my research. My potions are much better now. Yes, they have been getting good results but now I need a very special potion for a very special purpose. This is my best batch. My very best batch. It's just lovely, and I've even added a pound of dugong blubber. Is it powerful enough to work on Batman? Ooh. Batman is a special case. Bats have a very strong resistance to occult powers. But if anything will work, this will. Pass me the salt, deary. Cupid is loaded, Your Highness. Good. Leave me now. I'll clap if I need you. Yes, Your Highness. Come in. Watch out, Batman. The powers of darkness reside in this room. Holy harem, Batman. What a nest. There's more here than meets the eye, Robin. Welcome, darling. Welcome to my little flat. Sit down. Make yourselves comfortable. We're not here to be comfortable, Marsha. This is strictly a business call. How very rude of you, Batman. Batman's never rude to a lady, but you're no lady. She may not be a lady, Robin, but she is a woman and as such, she deserves some courtesy. How very gallant of you, Batman. Let's dispense with the mutual flattery, Marsha. Where are Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara? -How very irrelevant of you, Batman. They're unimportant. Let's talk about you and me. We have nothing to discuss in that area, Marsha. We will, darling. - We will. -Watch out, Batman, she's up to something. Ouch. Unh. -It's a dart. -Poison. Oh, not poison, darling. Merely a disposition improver. It's some kind of a drug, Robin. It's bending my will. - Batman. -Marsha. - Batman. -Oh, Marsha. - Batman. -Marsha. Fight it, Batman. Come. I'm trying. Robin, it's some kind of love-inducing drug. It's trying to bend my will, Robin. Ooh. To make me fall in love with Marsha. Batman. Holy fate worse than death, you've got to resist it. I am trying. I'm trying, Robin. Don't try to fight it, darling. Relax and worship me. Worship me, I said. On your knees. I prefer to stand, Marsha. Your drug didn't work. You did it, Batman. It wasn't easy, Robin. It took every last ounce of my willpower. You mean you're not in love with me? I'm not even mildly interested. Outrageous. How dare you reject Marsha, Queen of Diamonds? This is insufferable effrontery. Bah! Carve them into camel food. Yes, Your Highness. No. He's mine. You adorable creature. I'm yours to command. Oh, no. Robin. Here's your first command, my young worshipper. Stop that annoying fellow in the blue cape. Stop it, Batman. Marsha said, stop it. Do you hear? Do you hear? Robin, it's me, Batman. Batman, Batman. What do I care? You're annoying Marsha. I'll fight you to the death. All right, I'll stop. Well done, darling. Grand Mogul, take him to the suitors' quarters. - Don't touch him. -Ah, ah! One false move and your young friend remains at my feet forever. Only I can release him. If he had more experience, he might have been able to resist your drug but you took advantage of his youth. Cooperate or Robin remains in my power forever. All right, you win. No, let me stay near Marsha. I'm hers to command. No, let me stay! Don't worry, Robin, I'll get you out of this somehow. Well, Batman, what is he worth to you? This is not a joke. I'd give my life for that boy. Oh, the price isn't nearly that high, darling. I merely want the gigantic Bat-diamond that powers the Batcomputer. It's yours. But first you'll have to give Robin the antidote for that drug. No, no, no, not so fast. I want to appropriate that diamond myself personally. I wanna go into the Batcave and get it. That's impossible. Remember what's at stake. I couldn't do that, not even for Robin. I made a sacred vow that no stranger would ever enter the Batcave. And knowing you, you'd never break that vow, would you? Absolutely not. In that case, we'll have to figure out a way to get me into the Batcave without breaking your vow, won't we? That can't be done. Oh, where there's a will, there's a way. Now, let's see. You made a vow that no stranger would enter the Batcave. - What if I weren't a stranger? -What do you mean? What if I were Mrs. Batman? Marry you? Why not, darling? As your wife, I'd have every right to go in the Batcave. You must be joking. I never joke, darling. Besides, one vow deserves another. Now, think of Robin. Not to mention Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara. Unless we become a happy couple, those three will spend the rest of their lives following me around on their knees. I have no choice. Wonderful, darling. Yes, Your Highness? Batman and I are to be married this afternoon. Make all the necessary arrangements. Yes, Your Highness. Marsha, Queen of Diamonds. Mrs. Batman. Ha-ha-ha, how marvelous. This has been quite a day in Gotham City. First, the unexplained disappearance of Police Chief O'Hara. Followed by the disappearance of Commissioner Gordon. And now to top it all off the announcement that Batman will marry the Queen of Diamonds this afternoon. Who knows what will happen next on this strange and baffling day? Who knows indeed? As if anything could possibly matter after Batman has married that woman. I'd venture to say, madam, that Batman has been coerced in some fashion. He'd never submit to such a thing of his own free will. Oh, I quite agree with you, Alfred. I'm sure there's skullduggery afoot. - Question is, what to do about it. -You mean we should do something? Uh-- Why, yes, of course, madam. After all, we are citizens of Gotham City. Heaven knows Batman has done enough for all of us in the past. Oh, more than enough. But what can we do if Batman himself couldn't stop it? Well, we must try and think of something. Oh, I wish Bruce were here. I'm sure he could think of something. I'm not at all sure that he could. - I take it you're the best man? -Yes. It's time for the groom. In case you've forgotten the ring, Batman, I have six extras. I made a bargain and I'll stick to it. Anything is better than to let Robin go through life the way he is. It's natural to be a little nervous, darling. Everyone is, the first time. Robin had better be all right. Oh, he's perfectly safe as long as you cooperate. By the way, have you decided where we're going to spend our honeymoon? Not a very cheerful groom, are you? I'll be perfectly happy to spend my honeymoon in the Batcave. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today NARRATOR". Batman, to become a henpecked husband? And Mrs. Batman, Gotham City's arch-criminals? Do you, Marsha, take this Batman to be your lawful wedded husband? To love, honor, and obey as long as you both shall live? I do. And do you, Batman, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? To love, honor, and cherish as long as you shall live? I. -I -Say, "I do. " l 
NARRATOR". What's this? An ambush outside the home of millionaire Karnaby Katz? Where Catwoman, the Joker, and their evil cohorts lie wickedly in wait for Batgirl and the Caped Crusaders. Where will we get in touch with you in case we find more clues? Where can I get in touch with you, Batman? Yes, that has been a problem, but we'll manage. We have before. Looking for something, Batgirl? Like this spark plug, perhaps? So you didn't leave. Not only didn't we leave, but neither did our dependable Cats Paws. Won't she break through that thin twine, Catwoman? I think not, Joker. Those Cat's Whiskers, a fiendish invention of mine they automatically contract when placed in close contact with the heat of the body. So in seconds, Batgirl will be strangled to death thereby ridding Gotham City of one-third of the Terrific Trio. You see, when I do a job, I do it right. And why didn't we attack them all while we were at it? There are only four of us and three of them. The odds would be most perturbing. Finished? Yes, Catwoman. Soon, so is she. Ha-ha-ha! Let's get back to the novelty company and plan our next cataclysmic move. NARRATOR". Free at last as the sprinkling system has caused the Cat Whiskers to expand . . . rather than contract. You both look a trifle harassed, sir, if I may say so. Perhaps this snack will help. No, thank you, Alfred. You know I never mix crime-fighting with eating. Besides, I don't think it'll help us solve our problem with Catwoman and Joker. -I could force myself to take a bite. - Yes, commissioner? -Batgirl just called me, Batman. She wants you to meet her at the intersection of Cattail Lane and Ninelives Alley. That's behind the novelty manufacturing center of Gotham City. -She's on the other phone. - Shall I tell her you'll be there? -By all means. Right. Cattail Lane, Ninelives Alley. The Grimalkin Novelty Company is on that corner. Grimalkin? What kind of a name is that? An obscure, but nevertheless acceptable, synonym for "cat," Robin. Let's go. NARRATOR". While the Dynamic Duo race back to Gotham City Catwoman and Joker have already put their plan into motion. This is the map which will lead us to the gunpowder hidden over 200 years ago by Gargon Maltese, the famous crook. This nightshirt is a map? It's perfectly obvious, Joker. And thanks to it, we shall steal the gunpowder then blast our way in and out of the federal depository. Well, it's a funny map without any printing on it. It's the shape that's persuasive. This is a chart of Phony Island, located on the southern tip of Gotham City. Oh, and that X mark's the leeward end, and that's where the stuff is, right? Wrong. X does not mark the spot. It's the starting place. To find the exact location, we must look at the crib. It's written backwards and, heh-heh, in French. Giggler, get my mirror. Laugher, get my French dictionary. Ooh. That's the first time I ever heard a cat purr in French. Skip the flattery, Joker, and give me the translation. Oh. "From X on the map, walk 50 meters north, then 50 feet right then try to find the wrong stone. " Now, what's that supposed to mean? Exactly the opposite of what it says. The poem said it's a fib. Therefore, we walk 50 meters south, then 50 feet left to find the right stone. Oh, it's easy when you know the key. Well, shall we go? We shall, Joker. - How about rushing the place, Batman? -Shh. I think not, Robin. All they've done so far is stolen a few items, attempted to kill you, me and Batgirl. No, I think they plan something really big. Here they come. Meet us there, boys. The Kitty Car only holds two. - They're getting away. -No, Robin. I've adjusted the radar on the Batmobile to allow us to trace them. By tuning in on sonic emanations from their motor we'll be able to stay up to five miles behind them and still know precisely where they are. We'll stay out of their sight until they reach their destination. Then and only then will we pounce on them. To the Batmobile. What about my Batgirl Cycle? It's hidden around the corner. We'll pick it up later, Batgirl. It'll be much faster if we all go together. Hmm. Cozy. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, Catwoman and Joker arrive at the Phony Island Lighthouse. Formerly, a busy bastion of light, but now almost inoperative. Look for something marked with an X. I found it. I found it. I found the rock with the X mark. Aha. Good. From here on in, it should be a piece of cake. Now, 50 meters south and 50 feet left. You know, the only trouble with keeping this lighthouse, Mr. Keeper is that there isn't enough for a lighthouse keeper to keep keeping. Mrs. Keeper, I'm the lighthouse keeper. - You just keep the lighthouse clean. -Clean? All I do is vacuum the upstairs bedroom. What kind of life is that for a stylish, attractive, sophisticated, intelligent woman? Mrs. Keeper, when you married me, you know'd I was a lighthouse keeper. - You know'd it'd be a lonely life. -I thought it sounded romantic. But there's nothing romantic about shipwrecks and seagulls. Mrs. Keeper, we haven't had a shipwreck in two days. Of course, we haven't. The light's out in the lighthouse half the time. You'd think a lighthouse keeper would know how to keep his-- - Just stop talking. -Stop talking? Then I'd really have nothing to do except vacuum the upstairs bedroom. Well, at least stop talking to me. Here, you can talk to our visitors. Visitors? What visitors? There's a whole bunch of strangers headed in our direction. Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50. Now 50 feet left. One, two, three, four Well, what do you know? Company. I'd better get back upstairs and vacuum the bedroom. Vacuum the bedroom? What are you going up there for? Every five minutes, you're going upstairs to do some vacuuming. Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50. Should be around here somewhere unless I counted wrong. Maybe feet were smaller in those days. You sure you figured everything? I never make a mistake. Look what we found upstairs. Unhand me, you underhanded bully. Well, what do we have here? I am the lighthouse keeper. This is my missus, Mrs. Keeper. And this is private property. A lighthouse? Private property? Oh-ho-ho! Well, private public property. It means you keep off! I think we've heard enough. Let's get them. No. You're kaput. Finis, defunct. We're very much not defunct, Joker. Neither is Batgirl. This is some sort of perfidious trick. I'll bet it's done with mirrors. The mirror is broken, Catwoman. The last cat has crossed our path. From now on, all the luck is with us. Unhand those two helpless people. Look. There it is. The gunpowder. It's all clearly marked. - Gunpowder? - Put that match out, you fool. It's going to explode. - Let's get out of here. -There's no time. Stay calm, everybody. Stay calm, everyone. Holy return from oblivion. We're still alive. Yes, Robin. Still alive. In the split second before the actual detonation of the gunpowder I was able to infuse this one room with Anti-Blast Batpowder. Oh, very clever. I should say so. But what about the upstairs bedroom? I just vacuumed it. The city will make it up to you. They'll take the cost of your home out of Catwoman and Joker's prison pay for making license plates. That's what you say, Batman. But I say we'll never see the inside of a prison again. We're certainly never gonna see the inside of the federal depository and all that dough. Maybe later, Joker. But for now, I want benefit of counsel. That's certainly your privilege, Catwoman. Can I make my one phone call? Just don't try any of your old tricks. Who are you calling? Lucky Pierre, the world's greatest and luckiest criminal attorney. He's never lost a case. - Is it a toll call? -No. Only local. This dime should take care of the telephone call, Mrs. Keeper. Thanks, Batman. You're a perfect gentleman. Hello, Pierre. This is Catwoman. C-A-T-W-O-M -A-N. Batman just caught Joker and me in the middle of a robbery. Hmm. Difficult, but not insurmountable for Lucky Pierre. Now, be still and don't utter a meow. I'll see you in court. And if all goes well, knock on wood I'll have you sprung before pussy-willow time. Not good, huh? Listen, Joker, according to the pretrial briefs there's no way any jury in this world would fail to convict you. Any jury? Well, almost any jury. To beat this rap, you'd have to bribe every citizen of Gotham City. And that takes dough. Real dough. Has the jury been chosen yet? Batman is in the anteroom, interviewing them now. - Batman? -Yeah, Batman. Because of his familiarity with the case, the DA has allowed him to handle the prosecution. But I get my chance in a few minutes. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury Uh, gentlemen of the jury we are gathered here today to prove that Catwoman Joker, and their men are guilty of several major offenses. To wit: robbery, attempted murder assault and battery, mayhem and overtime parking. I would like to call as my first witness, Little Louie Groovy. Sure knows how to handle himself in the courtroom, commissioner. Little Louie Groovy, take the stand. Would you state your full name, please? Little Louie Groovy. Mr. Groovy, on the night of July 22nd of this year were you not robbed of a very valuable nightshirt? And was not assault committed upon your personage? Yeah. Are the persons who performed these dastardly deeds present in this courtroom? Yeah. For the record, would you point them out, please? Those cats over there. The chick with the swinging outfit, the creep with the green hair, and those four clowns. For the record, witness is pointing to the defendants. He's so authoritative. So confident. The more you work with Batman, the more amazing he seems. Cross-examination? No cross-examination. I now call Karnaby Katz to the stand. No cross-examination. I call as my final witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Keeper. And that's your statement, Mr. Keeper. That's his statement, not mine. I had just vacuumed the upstairs bedroom. And now there's no bedroom upstairs anymore. - Please, Mrs. Keeper-- -No. It's not any place. That's my statement. Cross-examination? No cross-examination. Thank you. I can't understand his tactics. He hasn't cross-examined one of my witnesses. He has something up his sleeve, all right. They don't call him "Lucky Pierre" for nothing. This is ridiculous. Aren't you gonna offer some sort of defense? - I know what I'm doing, Joker. -Oh! You're doing fine, Lucky. Keep your cool. Batman's about to sum up. Gentlemen of the jury you've heard the evidence of 14 separate witnesses including Robin the Boy Wonder, and Batgirl. Each one of them corroborating the other's story that those defendants are guilty of all the crimes with which they are charged. In the interests of law, order justice, good fellowship, and the flag you must convict them to keep our streets safe from evil persons. Thank you. - You were great, Batman. -Sit down, Robin. Thank you. - Yes, you learned your lessons well, Batman. -Begorra. Lucky Pierre is standing. He's gonna let us have it now. The defense waives summation in this case. We stand on our plea of not guilty and we feel sure that the jury will bear out the truth in this case. So be it. Jury's ordered to the jury room for deliberation. No need for that, Your Honor. We have already made up our minds. That's a good sign. This should be some sort of legal record for convictions by a jury. We find the defendants, Catwoman Joker, Giggler, Laughter, Smiley and Gus not guilty of any of the charges. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Order in the court. Order, I say. There's something very cat-fishy about this whole thing, Batman. - I think it's a fix. -That's the way the law is, Robin. They've received a fair trial and been adjudged not guilty. Every man is entitled to his day in court. We must abide by the jury's decision. Normally, after any case, I never make a statement to the jury. However, today, I cannot resist. Never in my 30 years on the Gotham City bench have I ever seen a more callous disregard for the facts in a case. You are all to be chastised for making a travesty out of the judicial process. Aw, stow it, judge. The case is over. Quit flapping your yap. Yeah. That's no foreman, that's Marvin the Moose. He used to work with Catwoman. And that second fellow is Dave the Dummy. He's also worked with Catwoman. Your Honor, I move for a new trial. - On which of several grounds? -On the grounds of a prejudicial jury. You don't know how prejudicial, Batman. All right, now. - What now? -You're on your way to prison, Catwoman. Will you never learn that you cannot outwit the law? Maybe one day I will, Batman, perhaps. You'll never succeed in circumventing justice, Catwoman. Not as long as honest and dedicated law enforcers have a breath left. Oh, forget the morals. Just get us back to jail, so we don't have to listen to these corny jokes. But morals are the stuff men are made of. And until criminals learn that, our job will not be done. However, if and when they do we'll be only too ready to hang up our capes and cowls. At least we met some very interesting characters. Little Louie Groovy, Karnaby Katz, Mr. and Mrs. Keeper. Don't forget Lucky Pierre. - Yeah. -Yes. If he hadn't gone so wrong, he might have had to find career in politics. Won a gubernatorial race, or the White House even. I guess it just wasn't in the books. Speaking of books, I promised I'd call my daughter at the library. - Ah. -Bonnie? NARRATOR". While at the library: Louie the Lilac. What are you doing here? And what are you doing with that boutonniere? I remember the time you stunned my friend Princess Primrose with an invisible knockout spray. This is not an invisible knockout spray, Miss Gordon. It is essence of lilacs. A scent which I intend to corner the perfume market of Gotham City. I thought that the police commissioner's daughter should be my first recipient. Gotham Public Library. Oh, Daddy, am I glad you called. You'll never guess who was just in here. Louie the Lilac? Back in Gotham City? NARRATOR". And Louie the Lilac is in indeed back in Gotham City and planning much more than just cornering the perfume market as you'll see in our next episode. 
Batman Another glorious morning in Gotham city. The day people are just starting to work. And the night people are ready to call it a day. My super instant mesmerizer. It never fails. Okay, boys, carry him out. Hey, just a minute. That's my cap. Take him along, too, boys. Look, look, look, you. What are you doing with my hat? Add him to the list. Right. Three more hats stolen right out from under our noses. Not to mention their owners. I would say a pattern is beginning to take shape. - A pattern, sir? - A villainous pattern, indeed. At this rate, no hat in Gotham City will be safe from Jervis Tetch. You mean the accursed Mad Hatter is back to his fiendish practices? Who else? It was a sad day, indeed, when the word "parole" was coined. If memory serves me, commissioner the Mad Hatter not only is a mortal enemy of Gotham City but also-- Precisely, Chief O'Hara. The Cowled Crusader, himself was a witness at the Mad Hatter's last trial. We have no other choice. We need his help and now. Let's hope to heaven we can reach him. But can they reach him? Or are millionaire, Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson up to something else this morning in stately Wayne Manor? I'll summon him, sir. You sent to Italy for that piece of rock? Piece of rock? Why, this is carrara marble, Dick. Famous from antiquity and still being quarried. Gee, carrara marble. Uh, it's just possible this bust was sculptured by the famous Carnato himself. Gosh, Carnato? One of the great masters. When we have more time, I'll acquaint you with the processes of sculpturing. It's fascinating, after which I devoted many hours of study. I'd like to hear about it, Bruce. Forgive me for interrupting, sir. But it's the Bat-phone. Hot diggity. I'm in a quandary, Bruce. The Gotham City gourmet society tea tasting is this afternoon. And I don't know whether to start with oolong or pekoe. Well, whatever decision you make, Aunt Harriet I'm sure it'll be the right one. Uh, they just called to report they sighted a black-footed albatross at Sleighter's Slew. And maybe a fork-tailed petrel. A fork-tailed petrel and a black-footed albatross on the day of the tea tasting? You know how they are about their bird sighting, madam. - Yes, commissioner? - Jervis Tetch. The Mad Hatter is at large again. - Him again? - We'll be right over. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na Batman I couldn't agree with you more, commissioner. It's the work of the Mad Hatter. Nobody's safe when that human scourge prowls our streets. It's possible he's planning to unleash a new reign of terror in our fair city. Terrifying defenseless citizens with that super instant mesmerizer in his high hat. That devil of a trademark. Where will he stop? In the court of law, Chief O'Hara. Where he's been stopped before. Exactly. When you testified against him in his last trial he said he'd get you, if it was the last thing he ever did. Few men die of threats, Robin. Commissioner Gordon. Yes. Right away. He struck again. He just stole the fire chief's hat and the fire chief from the convention hall. - Holy helmets. - Will you need reinforcements? Thanks, chief. I think it's best for you and your men to stand by closely until we catch this tricky devil. You have our gratitude. Thank you, Commissioner Gordon. Fighting crime deserves no gratitude. It's my fervent that warped minds such as his can be rehabilitated once and for all. Clear all exits for the Batmobile. I repeat, clear all exits for the Batmobile. But, at the same time, in this old building which doubles as a warehouse and the secret hideout for the Mad Hatter and his slippery stooges. . There. Two more to go. And the dummies of the conniving jury that convicted me will, at last, be properly topped. - How whimsical, Jervis. - Thank you, Lisa. It's a pleasure to share my moments of triumph with you. I'm supposed to be on my coffee break. At least, that's what I told Madam Magda. Madam Magda. Little does she know she's to be my next victim. Oh, how merry, Jervis. Before we get to the next victim when do we get the next meal? Gettin' bonnets for the dummies ain't filling our stomachs. Or our wallets. Our wallets will be filled, boys. As soon as I've completed the most fantastic hat snatch of my glorious career. Batman's cowl? Precisely. Jervis, that's positively waggish. Waggish, maybe. But taking on Batman's a big order, boss. The biggest. Not only will I add his cowl to my unique collection but I will have exposed our monstrous enemy once and for all before he meets his gory end. You rogue. Many others have tried killing Batman. Many others do not have the lethal equipment of my hat factory, Dicer. Start the motors. Excellent for sheering rabbit fur. Think what it would do to a man's skin. Jervis, I don't dare. These stretchers form felt into the shape of hat crowns. What form would they shape a man's muscles and marrow? Mush. Oatmeal mush. Crown croppers. And this, a felt shredder. Or should I say a shredder of a chubby felt? And this for shrinking and sizing hat bodies. But why not shrink and size the body of Batman himself? Oh, my heart leaps with joy when I think that one day my dastardly adversary may end up as a hat rim or crown. Or even. . a tassel on a Tam O' Shanter. A Tam O' Shanter. Oh, you pixie. Oh. I swore vengeance when he testified against me. And I'll get it. I'll get it. Of course, you will, darling. When do we get our break? I heard that, Cappy. Why do you think I snatched the owner of each hat the way I did? The jury is still out. Regalez vous. What an antique idea. We'll reach a verdict, soon. Two more jurors and I'll ask the biggest ransom Gotham City has ever heard of. All of this country's presidents hats currently on loan at the Gustonian Institution. Presidents hats? Yes, Washington's, Jefferson's Lincoln's, Grant's, worth millions. You're a genius, Jervis. And all topped by Batman's cowl. Oh, don't worry boys. It'll be top hat and tails from now on. It may be tougher than you think, trapping the Batman in his hideout without getting the cops involved. I've thought of that too carefully. That's why I picked another spot. That's where you. . and Madam Magda come in, Lisa. And here's where I leave. I can't be late for work, Jervis. I don't want to jeopardize my job at the millinery shop. Don't worry my dear, it'll all be so simple. So very simple. But what of Batman and Robin? Little realizing the enormity of the Mad Hatter's abominable schemes our dauntless duo cross questions a frightened hat check girl. Now, perhaps if you started again, Miss. . Babette. People call me Babette. That's my name. The robbery, the kidnapping? It all happened so quickly. I was counting my tips. And then, the fire chief's hat was gone? So was the fire chief, going anyway. While that funny man flashed that funny thing in his face. The super instant mesmerizer. Well, it super instant-ed the fire chief, alright. Then they carried him out. They? There were three of them all together. Three? Was one wearing a top hat and the others, homburgs? You must be clairvoyant or something. And I suppose it only took a second? How did you know? How could you have guessed? We're familiar with the method of operation of this criminal. I'm sorry I wasn't here to prevent his dastardly attack. Well, you're here now, Batman. Batman, your Bat-phone is buzzing. Thank you, Miss Babette. You've been of great assistance. I wish there was more I could do. Yes, Commissioner. The Mad Hatter has been spotted again. Outside Magda's Millinery Mason. - 61, Gotham Lane. - Roger. Hat shop, 61 Gotham Lane. Mason Magda. Hat box for high society. Oh, no, no, no. I don't like it at all. Actually, I like the one you're wearing very much better. Oh. . It is from my personal wardrobe, Mrs. Monteagle. And not for sale. Perhaps Lisa can find something similar. Maybe something with a little veiling, you know. No, no, no, no, no, no. Mrs. Monteagle, veiling is for much older women than you. You think so? Oh, I like that. Oh, yes, that's the one. Oh, it's beautiful Help! Help! Could it be, they're too late again? The Mad Hatter has heisted his eleventh head piece? And his eleventh juror? And made his escape under the very noses of the Dynamic Duo? Oh, Batman, am I glad to see you. - I'm Hermione Monteagle. - How do you do? There's been a kidnapping and a hat-napping both right in this place, right now. Alarming, indeed. And poor Madam Magda. They stole her, right under my very eyes. Oh, I don't know what the world's coming to. My, I simply love that cowl. I'm sure the communists had something to do with this. I suspect the culprit can be found closer to home. Hermione. Excuse me. The kidnapper dropped this as he was leaving. Perhaps it may be of some help. Clues are always helpful. Octave Marbot, sculptor. This is odd. It requires further thought and study. We must reappraise this situation. Gosh, Batman, sure. I'll report this to the authorities. I trust that Madam Magda's abductors will be apprehended before further harm befalls her. Or her hat. Oh, I loved her hat. And that divine cowl. I wonder if it comes in any other color. I know Octave Marbot. I'm sitting for a statue he's making of me. Statue? Holy happenstance. Yes, Warden Crichton requested it to exhibit at a Gotham State Prison to help inspire the convicts in his rehabilitation program. Gosh, Batman, that's a great idea. But why would the Mad Hatter drop this card in Madam Magda's shop? He could be taunting us with a clue. Perhaps the edge lighted, loose sight map of Gotham City will tell us some more. Now, he's been striking all over the city. Madam Magda's millinery mason. The silver shop which is here. Convention hall. Gotham sporting goods, over here. The hotel, where he stole the chef's hat. And the chef. Exactly, Robin. There is a pattern. And Marbot's studio is the topper. Robin, I suggest we pay a call on Monsieur Marbot. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I couldn't have stated it better myself, old chum. Can it be possible Batman has fallen for this ruse? And what about Octave Marbot himself? Is he an innocent sculptor? Or a part of this evil scheme? Better activate the anti-theft device, Robin. 'Gosh, yes, Batman. ' Commissioner Gordon says there's been a rash of car thefts. Oh, mon'amie, Batman and the Boy Wonder. To what do I owe the honor of this visit? You have come back for your next sitting? There's no time for posing today, Monsieur Marbot. We're here on a matter of grave urgency. Oui, but of course. What can I do to help you? Do you know a man named Jervis Tetch? Better known as the Mad Hatter. Jervis Tetch? Jervis Tetch. No. He's presently victimizing Gotham City. The Mad Hatter? And somehow he dropped this card when he made his last catch. I do not know where he could have gotten it. I don't know the Mad Hatter. I am Octave Marbot. A simple sculptor. Alright, Monsieur Marbot. We didn't mean to alarm you. Well, as long as you're here perhaps I could persuade you to pose. I'm having trouble with the tete. The head. Perhaps if I could persuade you to remove your cowl I could see what's wrong. Remove my cowl? In my dressing room, of course. Boy Wonder could hand it out to me. Alright, Monsieur Marbot. Come on, Robin. It's working better than I dreamed. Batman's in the dressing room with Boy Wonder. My expert mimicry of perfect French fooled them completely. The moment. . The moment has finally arrived. - Batman's cowl at last. - I don't like it, boss. Cowl or no cowl. Batman is still Batman. Never fear. He wouldn't dare follow us and be exposed for all the world to see. We'll take his cowl and be on our way. Conceal yourselves. I smell a rat. You smell the Mad Hatter in Marbot's disguise. He gave himself away with that remark about my statue's head. That was the first part he finished. And he was very pleased with it. You're not going to hand him your cowl, are you? Of course not, Robin. I wanna find the real Octave Marbot. Holy switcheroo. I should've known. - Someone's moaning - No doubt, our man. It is Octave Marbot. Untie him, Robin. I'm going to put an end to our crafty adversary once and for all. I wonder what could be keeping Boy Wonder. Jervis Tetch, your days of crime are over. Not till I get your cowl, Batman. My thirteenth hat. Cappy, Dicer, what are you waiting for? Hold this. I prepared myself with my anti-mesmerizing Bat-reflector. Holy ricochet. Robin, old chum. What did you do that for, boss? Now you'll never get his cowl. When the plaster hardens and is removed I'll get a mold of his cowl. Not only that, but Batman would be permanently plastered. Oh, it's a far, far simpler end for the cowled crusader. And the flailing knives mechanical stretchers, cylindrical chambers acid sprays and suction fans of my hat factory. Oh, it's a stroke of genius on my part if I do say so myself. And I'll be killing two birds with one stone. Two birds with one stone. How does Batman get out of this plaster trap? Has the Mad Hatter outwitted the Dynamic Duo for his own evil ends? The web of terror is just starting to tighten. Like the wet plaster is just starting to harden. Be prepared tomorrow. Same Bat-time. Same Bat-channel. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". A peaceful evening at Wayne Manor. Inside the stately living room, a musical rehearsal. Imagine me singing to the piano of the world-famous Chandell. I must have lost my wits. But you have a voice of a nightingale. And remember what we're rehearsing for the annual benefit of the great Wayne Foundation. Oh, my, yes. It's downright selfish of me to be so nervous, isn't it? Listen for a moment. I'll toy idly with the keys and set the mood again. Such mastery of the keyboard. It's almost hypnotic. I can almost smell the Highland heather, remembered so fondly from my youth. And I can see the Gordens and the Campbells coming down the slopes of Loch Lomond to meet-- - Bless my eyesight. - Oh. Good day to you, lads and lassies. A very good day to you. Hand over your jewelry, will you now? You fiendish figments of the imagination, what's the meaning of this? We are ghosts, maestro. We've been called from slumber by your bonny music. Aye, it will happen again and again wherever you perform. Go away. I've never heard such a monstrous threat in all my life. Hear this then, maestro. Oh, it's inhuman. Indeed, madam. Demonic. - Oh. - Swiftly now, lassies, we've much to do. - The bonny baubles are in the bag. -Well done, lassies. Now, let's see what else we can pick up in handsome Wayne Manor then it's over the hills and far away. Oh. Oh, maestro, maestro. Oh, mercy alive. Police. Amazing, an armed assault by female phantoms. Ha. Almost beyond belief. And in our house too. What on Earth will Bruce and Dick say when they get home? Get home? Uh, Mr. Wayne is away? Oh, yes, he's off in the wilds with the Millionaires Hunting Club and my nephew, Dick, is on a school holiday. Maybe a blessing. With any luck, we'll have this wrapped up by the time they return. Luck spelled "Caped Crusaders. " Oh. What a wonderful idea. - Why didn't I think of them? Heh-heh. Police headquarters. Switchboard, Commissioner Gordon here. Plug me in at once into the hotline Batphone circuit. I regret to say, sir, Batman and Robin are not at present available. What? Well, surely, you must be jesting. Alas, sir, I am not. Batman is enjoying one of his infrequent vacations. Catastrophic, unprecedented. Batman and Robin not available. You-- You know what this means, don't you? If you're thinking what I'm afraid you're thinking Precisely, Chief O'Hara. The moment we've dreaded for years has arrived. This time we're going to have to solve a case ourselves. Who knew in advance that you would be playing a Scotch theme? Yes, Mr. Chandell, who indeed? Who beside yourself? Really, gentlemen, I'm dismayed. This morning's Gotham City Times, the society page: "Among the highlights will be a medley of Highland airs sung by Mrs. Harriet Cooper to the piano of the incomparable Chandell. " This travesty's gone far enough. Now, are you going to call Batman, or do I have to call him myself on that famous hotline I've read so much about? Mr. Chandell. It's useless. The grim truth is that Batman and Robin are on vacation. The Dynamic Duo, out of town? How crushing. Crushing, indeed. Well, who is going to protect my concert tonight at Gotham Town Hall? Tonight? Now, hear this, emergency, cancel all leaves. Throw a complete anti-criminal cordon around Gotham Town Hall. Don't count us out, Mr. Chandell. The situation is well in hand. Good day, sir. A good day, sir. But will it be a good night? I'm frightened, Chief O'Hara. An echo haunts my ears. I'd give me right arm to hear it now. The noblest, most inspiring words in the entire English language: "To the Batmobile, Robin. Let's go. " NARRATOR". Behind the facade of a bankrupt manufacturer of music rolls for mechanical player pianos the headquarters of an infamous criminal genius, Chandell. Seems almost too easy with Batman and Robin on vacation. Chandell, love, could it be a trap? Oh, impossible, my sweets. You should have seen the dear commissioner's face. The Dynamic Duo is away, all right. What a break. The one every super crook has dreamed of. They're utterly fooled. Our clever charade at Wayne Manor has put me above suspicion. Gee. Oh, that must be your twin brother, Harry, at the secret entrance. Get into your costumes, dearies. I'll let him in. Everything set for tonight's caper? Of course. Tiny radio transmitter hooked up inside your criminal piano? - Naturally. -It should be a pretty good haul. I'll take 95 percent this time. You fiend. Blackmailing a genius like myself into a life of crime. It's your own fault, Chandell, kid using a mechanical player piano at the White House concert which made you famous. What else could I do? I'd hurt my fingers in the piano lid. Who cares? If I expose what you did, the great Chandell is deader than this music roll factory. Using a player piano, fooling the president of the U. S. A with a roll out by Paderewski. Harry, what would it take for me to get out of your power? Five million bucks, cash. I can get it for you, Harry. Five million? Where? I have a fantastic plan. In fact, I've already started. If it works, I'll have the entire fortune of the Wayne family. Chandell, have you flipped your keyboard? Ask me no more, dear brother, you'll see. What, we have to be fingerprinted before we enter the auditorium? - How very gauche, if I may say so. -Oh! All right, Hoffman. Officer. Let these people through. As I scarcely need tell you, Mrs. Cooper, we have grave fears tonight. I'm taking no chance of a criminal slipping through. Of course, I understand. But how embarrassing for poor Chandell. Can't be helped. I'm leaving no stone unturned in our effort to protect him. - Have a pleasant evening. -Thank you. Still, it nags at me. There's a certain indefinable clumsiness in our procedure. D-minus-5 seconds, curtain going up. Commissioner Gordon to all machine gunners stationed in theater boxes, get ready. At the first sign of criminal activity, make every bullet count. Strange. Strange? Strange what? I've been listening to that Chandell concert from Gotham Town Hall. Just before the end of "Danse Arabe" he struck a C-minor chord that I'm positive doesn't belong there. I'm not sure I follow you. Oh, I don't know, just a simple error. But do me a favor, chum, run out and check the muskrat traps? Sure thing, Bruce. Gee, Sal. Gosh, Dick. - That about says everything, doesn't it? -Uh-huh. Oh, me and my left-footed thumbs, how did I do that? It's all right, Dick, I'll mop it up. - Are you sure? -Uh-huh. Oh, don't be upset. - Dick Grayson to Bruce Wayne, what's up? -Not sure. What would you say if I said the great Chandell had just made a mistake in a C-minor chord? Holy impossibility. Precisely, Dick. Something strange and unusual is going on. I'm afraid it means the end of our vacations. Oh, of all the awful luck. - Mm, beg pardon? -Never mind, Bruce. The fight against crime comes before everything. - Where do you want me to meet you? -Wayne Manor. I fear we haven't a moment to lose. Good heavens. The Burma Import Company, it's just been blasted and robbed. Saints alive. While he was playing a Burmese number. The same dreadful pattern. The felons were a trio of female phantoms, apparently Burmese dancing girls. Chief O'Hara to all machine gunners you can put back on your safety catches, we've been outfoxed. Batman. Batman, where the devil are you in this hour of need? Yes? Chandell here, my sweets. How did it go? Like a dream, lover. Too bad we have to turn over 95 percent to that chiseling, bad nick brother of yours. Don't worry, we'll buy him off forever, quite soon. Instructions, stake out Wayne Manor and let me know the moment Bruce Wayne and his young ward return. A grim tale, indeed. I reproach myself bitterly for having been out of touch. Oh, I wouldn't do that, sir. Doubtless your brief excursion into the wilderness has sharpened your mind. True, Alfred, and yet Where's Mrs. Cooper now? At her request, sir, I left her at Gotham Town Hall. She insisted on paying a private visit to the great maestro in his dressing room. Gosh, he's quite a famous ladies' man, isn't he? Really, Dick, I'm afraid some romantic interlude has fevered your imagination. Your Aunt Harriet is utterly above reproach. Gee, whiz, I certainly didn't mean that she Holy apparition. Gone, like wraiths. Who the heck were they? Criminal tools, of course. There's a mystery here and I have a strange hunch that Chandell is at the heart of it. - Will the commissioner be in his office? -Of course. In the face of this crime wave he'll be alertly marshaling all the forces of law and order. - Yes? -Put any fears you may have had aside commissioner, we're back in action. Batman. Batman. The answer to a policeman's prayer. Thank you, commissioner. Good night. First on the agenda, check on Aunt Harriet. To the Batpoles. Let's go. Bonnie, call Chandell in his dressing room at Gotham Town Hall. Tell him the Dynamic Duo is back in action. Yes, sir. Back in action? Uh, how reassuring. Thank you for the information. What is it, maestro? Oh, nothing, just a call from my agent. - Are you enjoying your root beer? -Oh, yes, it's delicious. May I? Yes, sweet lady, it has been most delicious but I fear this thrilling tÃ©te-Ã -tÃ©te must come to an end for now. Oh, how thoughtless of me. Artists like yourself need sleep, don't they? You put it so well. Dear Harriet, until tomorrow? Oh, what dreams I'll have. I trust you'll have no trouble getting home, my pet? I sent Alfred on ahead but there's almost always a cab waiting downstairs. Until tomorrow. - Parting is such sweet sorrow. -Oh. Until tomorrow. Good news, Chandell, kiddo, your pal, Mr. Wayne, is back. Bad news, so are the Caped Crusaders. They must be eliminated. - How? - Are your nasty piano movers handy? Yeah. They're snoozing in the back room. Awaken them at once. Do exactly as I say. There's Aunt Harriet now, getting into that cab. - Holy relief, she must be on her way home. -No doubt, Robin. Let's have a word with Chandell, shall we? The poor devil. He's been assaulted with a root beer bottle. What luck. Here's a bottle of smelling salts. Heavenly days, am I dreaming? No, it's us, in the flesh. Who attacked you? I've covered for the fiend long enough. It was my criminal twin brother, Harry. Holy fratricide. Any idea where he hangs out? As a matter of fact, yes. His lair is an abandoned music roll factory. Twenty Befront Street. Zip code, 9999979. Thank you, Chandell. We'll take care of him. Come on, Robin. Look, Batman, the felonious phantoms. Indeed, Robin. From the looks in their eyes, I think they're the victims of some kind of criminal hypnotism. Let's interrogate them, huh? Good thought, Robin. Perhaps we can learn something. Take them to the cutting machine. Holy pianola, what is this? It's obvious, we're about to be fed into a machine designed to perforate paper into player piano rolls. Farewell, costumed clowns. And now, exit music for a pair of bats. You'll come out presently as perforated music rolls. The great Chandell could play no more prettily than you will. Good bye. 
NARRATOR". Another serene day in Gotham City. But on the terrace of a penthouse suite atop the sky-high Gotham Arms storm clouds gather. Puzzler, what if Artie Knabi finds us in his penthouse? It's Artemus Knab, Rocket. He isn't due back till later today and I have a passkey. I don't think he'd mind. You see, as Shakespeare would say: "We are birds of the selfsame feather. " All right, Glider, Blimpy, is the model plane ready to soar? - Just like you said, Puzzler. - Ha, ha! Yes, this should startle the pillars of the law. The caterpillars of the commonwealth which I have sworn to weed and pluck away. A quotation from the bard, Rocket. - Phoo. Wow. -King Richard II. And I would particularly like to see it sail through that window down there. I realize your prison facilities are becoming overcrowded, Warden Crichton. Doubtless that could be attributed to the efficiency of this department. Yeah. Me thinks I'll launch this myself. That? Well, for your information, Warden Crichton, that was an explosion. Yes, right here in this office. Commissioner, are you all right? - What happened? -I don't know. Model plane just sailed through the window and dropped a bomb. Oh, a child's prank, no doubt. Some child. A window this high up? What's that? A message attached? Oh. Uh "Forsooth, the puzzles are coming"? "I know a bank where the wild time blows, inside out the puzzle goes. " Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Chief O'Hara? - Aren't I always, commissioner? -Well, then. Sure, and who else could it be but the Puzzler himself come to confound and confuse us? I know we've been working the Caped Crusader overtime lately. But I feel I'd be shirking my duty to the populous of Gotham City if I didn't call on his help in this dire crisis. Why, Dick, it worked. Wren heard you. Yes, Dick, your birdcalls are close to perfect. If more people practice them someday we might have a chance for real communication with our feathered friends. In that case, I think I'll polish up my ruby-crowned kinglet and my rose-breasted yellow-tailed grosbeak calls. The Batphone, sir. Why don't you continue practicing those calls out at White's Pond, Dick? Heh. White's Pond, Dick. I could get some fishing in at the same time. Let's go. - Those two, always on the move. -Youth, madam, youth. Yes, commissioner. Right away. To the Batpoles. There is no doubt about it, gentlemen. Puzzler's maleficent methods are legendary. Plus the fact that they're usually connected with an aviatic caper. Along with his Shakespearean touches. Holy Hamlet. In this particular instance it's the backward puzzle that intrigues me. - Backward, Batman? -Yes, "I know a bank where the wild time blows, inside out the puzzle goes. " Maybe he's asking a question. Like, "What will I rob next?" Perhaps. But we all know the Puzzler uses reverse logic from-- Reverse. Why, that's it. "Inside out. " Robin, take the word bank and spell it backwards. K-N-A-B. Knab. - Add A for Artemus. -Holy deposit slip. Artemus Knab. One of the richest men in the world. - And he's right here in Gotham City now. -Correct, Robin. And some of Artemus Knab's millions come from his aviation monopoly. Along with his many other monopolies. Gentlemen, I strongly suspect that Puzzler's prime and present target is Artemus Knab. You've done it again, Batman. Chief O'Hara, take some men over to Artemus Knab's penthouse suite at the Gotham Arms immediately. A moment, commissioner. May we handle this? I welcome the opportunity to cross swords, as it were, with Puzzler. And we won't attract as much attention as a police squad moving in. By all means, Batman, if that's the way you want it. We haven't a moment to lose, Robin. Whoever they are beneath those masks-- You've said that before, commissioner. And I'll say it to my dying day, Chief O'Hara. Gotham City owes the Dynamic Duo a debt which can never be repaid. Well, if this Artemus Knab is as rich as they say, maybe he can help a little. That's what I said, sell. I don't care what happens to the market. I'll give you 5200 for Park Place and not a penny more. - Six thousand. -Fifty-eight now, two when I pass Go. Move. Yes. Did you get a quote on Pan Uranium? Good, buy all you can get. I don't know how, just buy it. And I'll give you 5000 for Boardwalk. Yes. What do you mean, you can't find a 200-foot diesel yacht? I don't know how, just find it. This castle hath a pleasant seat. Yes. So the movie is 5 million over budget. Who cares? It's my 5 million. Keep shooting. Hold my calls. Now, what's all this about castles and seats? Macbeth, Act 1. But you do have a splendid penthouse, Artemus. I can see you enjoy the pleasures of life. Mm-hm. Ha-ha-ha. One hotel is the same as another to me. I couldn't have put it better myself. Oh, good. Good. I like a partner who agrees with me. Yes, that always makes for a better partnership. Now, by two-headed Janus nature hath framed strange fellows in her time. Art thou not verily the Caped Crusaders? You mean Batman and Robin? I'm sorry we came in unannounced, Mr. Knab via Batropes up the side of the building. I'll explain presently. - Yes, Puzzler, I am Batman. -And I'm Robin. We suspected you'd be in town. And we also had reason to believe he'd be in this penthouse suite with you, Mr. Knab. Is that your explanation for interrupting it? We thought you might be in trouble. I'm Artemus Knab. I'm never in trouble. Never. And he's Puzzler, who knows every weasel word in the book. Weasel words, as you put it, are no concern to me. Puzzler has come up with a novel idea out of which I expect to make millions. More millions. And if that's trouble, Batman, I'd like a lot more of it. You mean more honest millions? Young man, there's no easier buck to be made in this world than an honest buck. -Oh, how true. I'm sorry, Mr. Knab. Robin is sometimes inclined to be a bit impetuous. Impetuous and curious about that backward puzzle of yours. Yes, Puzzler, just what is your novel idea for increasing Mr. Knab's coffers? My usual novel method, Batman. These are highly competitive days. Anyone with a product to sell must look for a new and unique approach to publicity and advertising. - Publicity? -Advertising? Yes, for this new venture. I'm backing Puzzler in the manufacture of puzzle balloons. - Something seldom done before. -Never done before. Mm. it should make an interesting addition to my airplane monopoly. Not to mention my movie-studio monopoly. My stock-market monopoly, my ship-building monopoly my various other lesser monopolies. Care to see a sample of our wares? Here, Boy Wonder. You're obviously not too old to play with balloons. Maybe not. But I'm old enough to recognize a bunco artist when I see one. Really, Artemus? How much more am I expected to take from this caped nincompoop? Nothing more. But allow me one last warning, Mr. Knab. Your new business partner is not called Puzzler for nothing. Forgive the intrusion. Let's go, Robin. Uh, use the front door. It's faster that way. I just hate to see a reasonably successful multibillionaire like Artemus Knab taken for a ride by that shady, pseudo-Shakespearean swindler. I suspect even Puzzler's met his match in Artemus Knab. But let's see what problem this sample balloon poses, shall we? "If you knew a hawk from a handsaw would you know a parrot from a plane?" Maybe he was telling the truth. Sample balloon, a silly puzzle. I'm not sure. "A hawk from a handsaw" is in a line from Hamlet, Act 2, Scene 2. "I know a hawk from a handsaw," if I remember properly. But a parrot from a plane, airplane Of course. Puzzler said the balloon might entertain us. And an airplane and entertainment mean only one thing. Holy flight plan. Artemus Knab's coming-out party for his new fantastic plane, the Retsoor. Yes, with some of the crÃ©me de la crÃ©me of Gotham City society attending. And that among other things spells expensive jewelry. Puzzles, airplanes, jewelry. - Let's get to the airport. -Right, Robin. NARRATOR". A short time later, in an airplane hangar at Gotham City Airport Ahem. Your attention, please. Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen friends, folks I hereby christen the Retsoor code name for this experimental model of my X-1000 counter insurgency reconnaissance jet plane. NARRATOR". At the same time, outside the hangar, a strange delivery. Well, have a good time. And remember, your donations are going to a very worthy cause. Research for my aviation monopoly. Well Zounds, that was a close call. I thought Artemus Knab would have left. - Artemus Knab? In that beat-up old jalopy? -He's a trifle eccentric. Hey, why didn't you introduce me? He'll never make me a movie star if he never meets me. Harp not on that string, Rocket. Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens. Fat and greasy? A favorite line of mine from As You Like it, Blimpy. Translated, it means, "Get going. " This caper calls for split-second timing. I don't get it. If you plan to steal the airplane, why waste time with the jewelry? A little extra pocket money never came amiss, Blimpy. My mission is to photograph Retsoor's controls, yours is to line our pockets. Let the masquerade commence. On with the play. Get your puzzle balloons here. Don't forget it. Folks, the kiddies'll love them. Here you are, folks. Take all you want. - Sticks. - Ready. Pow. Pow. That invisible puzzle balloon gas is doing yeoman service. Bewildering our prey is far better than knocking them out. Wow, I just wanna touch all those jewels. Frailty, thy name is woman. We must not hesitate. Our uninvited guests will be here presently. Ah Wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow. Sweets to the sweet. Farewell. Rocket, depart by yonder portal. - We'll see you at the factory. - Gee, thanks. All the world's a stage. Now we wait. Just what I wanted, to catch you in the act, Puzzler. My timing is perfect. Lord, what fools these mortals be. Puzzle balloons for the Dynamic Duo, boys. There's something in the air, Robin. The game's afoot, curtain going up. Aye, and the Caped Crusaders muddled and mazed like all the others. Do we liquidate them now, boss'? No, Glider, I have a far more delicious idea for their demise. And now to snap a few pictures of the plane's cockpit and then for some more puzzles. On with the show. "What letter is ne'er perceived in the alphabet?" The letter you put in the mailbox. But what could that mean? Maybe the answer is on this piece of paper which was in that balloon. Gosh, Batman, it might be. And also might be the reason Puzzler or one of his heinous henchmen pinned that balloon on me while I was momentarily incapacitated. "Yay, verily, the answer is a fence in this world's globe. " Uh-huh. Of course, a fence is someone who buys stolen jewelry. Mm. Mm. I don't think Puzzler would make it that easy for us, old chum. The hammer spring of a gun lock is also called a fence. And they say a horse fence as well when he leaps a fence. Maybe that's it, Batman. Just a plain fence. Maybe Puzzler wants to make it easy for us. Hm. If we follow that line of reasoning, what constitutes a fence? - Boards, palings, rail, wire, posts. -Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Post, like the letter you put in a mailbox. It's a double clue. Yeah, but the answer is a fence. An enclosure, something separating one yard from another. - Barnyard, graveyard, shipyard, railroad yard. -Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm! Railroad yard. We may be on to it, Robin. The main post office is located directly adjacent to the railroad yard. And somewhere in that facility, Puzzler plans to sell his stolen jewelry. I've got it. The Old Globe Balloon Factory is also adjacent to the railroad yard. I should have seen that from the start. One moment, please. - Now, may I help you? -I'd like to see Puzzler, please. - Your names, please? -Batman. And Robin. - If you're salesmen-- -We're not. Well, I'm sorry, the Puzzler told me he's not seeing anyone today. At the risk of sounding conceited, young lady, we are not just anyone. Let's go, Robin. Just as you thought, Puzzler. They're on their way in right now. Man the barricades. All right, Puzzler, your insidious little game is, as they say, up. Not quite, Batman. I know a trick worth two of that. Attack. I'd say this calls for drastic action. Ow, ow, ow. Hey. Batman, help. - What are you gonna do with those? -The point envenomed too. - Ouch! -Batman. Pow. Boy, that's really giving them the needle. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Rocket. There's something in the wind, Caped Crusaders. Holy Graf Zeppelin, an aerial balloon. And here's another little surprise for you. You see this altimeter? When you reach 20,000 feet an automatic mechanism will release the basket from the balloon and you both will re-affirm Newton's law of universal gravitation back down 20,000 feet. Bet even Shakespeare didn't have words for such villainy. Glider, Blimpy. - Hey, you guys want some gum? -Really, Ramjet? That's what they give you in airlines before you take off. No, thank you. Litter bug. Now, for the launching, give me the dagger. This is the unkindest cut of all. Farewell, Dynamic Duo. Bon voyage, happy landings. Adieu, adieu, remember me. 
Batman Gotham City, Woodrow Roosevelt High School. 3:09 p. m. Normal healthy activity in the school gymnasium. - You got it memorized? - I think so. Okay, let's go. And. Zing! Boom! Sis boom bah We're from Woodrow Roosevelt That's who we are Does anybody scare us? The answer is nix Come on team let's make it six Yeah! Okay. Gosh, Susie, terrific! Did you write it yourself? Oh, heck no. Miss Browning, our poetry professor. Let's take a break, gang. Anyone for a drink? Me. Holy cow! Look. Silver dollars. Let me try. Hey, kids, everyone. Come one. It's Christmas. Look. Silver dollars. A strange disturbing bonanza from a gimmick milk machine. Either of you men fear what I fear? The Joker? Exactly, Chief O'Hara! The Joker. That most pestilent of predators. The Clown Prince Of Crime. This smells like an opening gambit of his. That devil! - But how can we be sure? - We can't. Not yet. But if it's The Joker we're facing then his plot is aimed at Gotham City youth. We can't wait to be sure. Now this if there ever was one is a case for our unknown friend behind the mask. And in Wayne Manor, stately residents of millionaire socialite Bruce Wayne and his young ward Dick Grayson whom we just saw at school. Please, Bruce, I beg you. Accept the proposal. Run for mayor. It's funny. They come to you with the same offer every two years. You'd think they'd get it through their heads you're not interested. I'm afraid she's right, Mr. Vandergilt. You see the good works of my Wayne Foundation require that I stay above the brawl of politics. But Gotham City needs you. Think of our problems. The snarl of traffic. A water shortage. And now these recurrent power failures. 'How can you turn this down?' Ahem! 'What is it, Alfred?' Nothing of importance, madam. It's the Bat-phone, sir. Thank you, Alfred, for reminding me. I tell you what, Mr. Vandergilt. I'll ponder it and give you my answer tomorrow. Aunt Harriet, give Mr. Vandergilt some more tea, will you? He'll ponder it? That's strange. What's he got to ponder? Yes, commissioner. 'Prepare yourself for a blow. ' Someone has struck in Woodrow Roosevelt High. We think it's The Joker. Good grief! I'm on my way. Dick's in the thick of this already. If he calls, tell him to stay where he is. - Very good, sir. - The switch, Alfred. Good luck, sir. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Nana nana nana nana nana nana nana na Batman Looks sinister, doesn't it? Joker released from jail one week ago immediately buys control of One-Armed Bandit Novelty Company. Makers of coin operated gadgets. Gum machines, pin balls, that sort of harmless junk. There's nothing harmless about The Joker, we all know that. Or about a machine which returns What about the men who install the machine and service it? Clean as driven snow, Batman. And they're even more surprised than we are. Ah, it's open and shut. Somebody got to that poor innocent machine and gimmicked it. But why? In the devil's name, why? I can make a guess. Yes. Oh, thank you, Bonnie. Put him on the conference phone. It's Principal Schoolfield. Woodrow Roosevelt High. 'Commissioner Gordon?' Speaking. Another machine has gone mad. In the library. Instead of candy bars it's dispensing negotiable stocks and bonds. 'To put it mildly, student morale is cracking up. ' Schoolfield, this is Batman here. Do you hear me? 'Ah, yes, hello, Batman. ' Who's the president of your student council? A boy named Grayson. Uh, Richard Grayson. 'A fine lad. ' I'm glad to hear it. Have him call a meeting in your office I'll be right there. I'll have him waiting for you. Goodbye. - I think my guess was right. - What, Batman? No time to lose. Chief O'Hara, get me a visual ID file on The Joker. - Meet me at the Batmobile. - Yes, sir. I mean, like, look, Dicky. So everyone's goofing off. - So why shouldn't they? - It's quite true. The purpose of our studies is to equip us to make our way in life. If on the other hand one has merely to insert a dime in a machine-- He's right. Why go through all that studying? Cryin' out loud! I'm surprised at you guys. We're meant to be student leaders. Susie, what do you say? I say, has anyone tried Mr. Schoolfield's coffee machine? Hey, not bad for old Schoolfield. Quarters! Look. Hey, not bad, eh? - How about that? - Wise up, you guys. Life isn't this easy. Well, that's easy for you to say. You're the ward of that rich millionaire. That has nothing to do with it. Hey, Gray, cut it out. Here comes Batman. Sorry, kids. Stay back. Sorry, Robin isn't with me. This Batmobile is filled with delicate anti-crime equipment. You might set of the automatic anti-theft system. Nobody closer than 50 feet, please. Hey, Batman, where's Robin? 'Attending school. Just as you are. ' - What school? - I can't tell you that. It might reveal his secret true identity. Now, listen, if anyone hears a sharp beep 'let me know at once. ' It'll be the Bat-phone ring with an important message. And even as Batman races into the school across town in a fashionable little bistro. 'Ha ha ha, the joke's on you, my cherry booze hounds. ' 'It's a stick up!' 'Hands up, you coward. ' 'Thanks, folks. The party will now resume. ' Believe me, this may look like a party but it's not. There's a crook behind these handouts. - What's his angle? - He may have several. One is to lure you into a receptive pattern of easy living. You'll quit your studies, become dropouts. You'll have no other recourse but to join criminal groups. Batman's right. It's sort ofrecruiting drive. Sure, he's right. What did I tell you? Can you corroborate this odd hypothesis? Yeah, Batman, like, what's the crook's name? I can do better than that. I can show you his picture. - What's your name, son? - Richard Grayson, sir? 'Thank you, Richard. ' You darken the room, I'll man the projector. Roger. Here it is, everybody, The Joker. 'Don't be deceived by that grin, anyone. ' 'He's one of the most malevolent malefactors we've ever met. ' I'll bet he's a master of makeup too. You're right. He is. He might be skulking around here in any one of For example, here's another one. 'A little closer, kids. ' 'I want you to see that phony flower in his button hole. ' Sometimes it shoots out water. Sometimes powder. 'Other times, knock-out gas. ' Hey! Holy magician! Hello, kiddies, meet The Joker. And no hard feelings. Ow! Corny, aren't I? Joker, what are you doing here? Oh, just passing by. I heard my name and I couldn't resist shooting a jolly jet through the tiny perforation in that screen. Just passing by, huh? To do what? Gimmick another innocent vending machine? Oh, there must be bats in your belfry, Batman. Has anyone found fingerprints or other evidence? You're too smart for that, Joker. Hey, Batman, nab him anyway. Loitering on school property. Right. $5000 fine and five years imprisonment. Ha ha! No. Wrong, kiddies. Look up the statute. In Gotham City, the crime of loitering requires the loiterer to remain in the same spot for over two minutes. You. . You jailhouse lawyer! A tricky trickster! He's outwittin' us. Oh, dear me! The court jester must run. Jest in time. Well, goodbye, kiddies. And remember I was here, eh! What an odd parting remark. Yeah, why does he want us to remember he was here? From the lips of a crook, it can mean only one thing. Establishing an alibi. Right. Gee whiz! Alibi for what? The Bat-phone signal. - Batman! - Hey, Batman! 'It's your Bat-phone. ' 'The Bat-phone, Batman!' What now, commissioner? Another strike. A cocktail lounge. A gimmick jukebox. It must be The Joker. We'll never make it stick. He has an alibi. - 'Maybe we can bring him. ' - Impossible, the alibi is me. - What? You? - Forget it. Give me the address. I'll race to the scene of the crime. Right. Goodbye. 'Batman, sir. ' You forgot your box of slides. Good, lad. Bring it over. Fake a headache, speed home wait for me in the Bat-cave. You're welcome, sir. Boys and girls, go back to your studies. 'Believe me, nothing in life is free!' Scarcely, 500 yards away behind this innocent seeming candy store an abandoned garage, now headquarters of The Joker and his current gang, the Bad Pennies. High school dropouts, most of them. It's a pretty good haul, isn't it? Peanuts, my boy, mere peanuts. That bar job was just a pot boiling appetizer for the real feast. Oh-ho-ho! What an inspired stroke of mind buying up the One-Armed Bandit Novelty Company. Plunder by remote control. Hey, Joker, I think I got this one rigged. Come and have a look. - Put it all away. - Right. Set to go off on the third strike? Yeah, and I got two strikes rung up already. Ho-ho! Here we go! Sensational! It's a gas! Oh, you won't be caught smoking a bar. It'll be your knock-out stuff. You've done it again, Two Bits. Thank-- A timed reminder, crime can be shocking. Someone's trying the bubblegum machine. Hiya, gang! Sweet Sue, shiniest of my Bad Pennies. Boy, Joker, you sure are some card. Popping out at school like that at Batman. Wondrously whimsical, wasn't it? It was real crazy if you ask me. I might have fainted and given the whole game away. However, you didn't. Ah, I see you have this stuff. - Of course. - Any trouble getting it? Heck no. Like I told you being chief cheerleader puts me on the student council. Once you're on that, you can get away with anything. Let's see. Hands off. Not until I get paid. Trusting little wench, aren't you? I'm a crook, Joker, just like you. Now where's the payoff? Oh! Hiya there, lamb chop, you busy tonight? You lowlife, get away from me. Now, look here, baby, I have plans-- Are you stupid or something? The reason I've taken up crime is so I can get a taste of the finer things in life. - Yeah-- - Now beat it! Uh-oh. - Shut your eyes, Sweet Susie. - Oh, yeah? And get an exploding cigar in my ears? No, thanks. You mischievous varmint, shut your eyes, I said. Rhinestone bracelet. A fox fur stole. . and one full quart of imported Mexican perfume. Oh, gee, Joker. I'm sorry I sassed you. Why, this is like some lovely dream. Ah! Perfect! Stolen right from Schoolfield's safe. The key card to my malevolent machination. But what is it, Joker? Look, you boobs. Look and laugh. Examination papers. X plus Y times X plus Y. . Holy alphabet, what is it? If you'll excuse me, Master Robin. Yes, Alfred? The solution is X squared plus 2XY plus Y squared. Gee, sure! Why didn't I know that? And with nationwide pre-college exams coming up in just three days. Good to have you home. - What'd you find out, Batman? - Nothing. Holy vacuum, not a single clue? We don't need clues, Robin. We know our man is The Joker. What we need is evidence. I went over that looted lounge with a fine toothed comb I didn't even find a single hair to analyze. Gosh. And school morale in a tailspin. Come a month from now, there'll be dropouts by the bushel. - 'If he waits that long. ' - Huh? I didn't want to cause panic at the student meeting. But I think The Joker has some other dirty plan afoot as well. - Like what? - 'I don't know. ' But I think it involves gimmicked machines and Woodrow Roosevelt High. Gee, if we just knew how he gets in to fix them. You've guessed it, Robin. Our next move. - Stake out the school. - Right again. Let's go! Hello, hello. Give me the sign. How do you stop a dog from barking in July? Countersign, Shoot them in June. Very good. Listen, Batman and Robin just drove into the parking lot. What? The Dynamic Duo at the school? That's right, Joker. What'll I do? Take another lam? No, no, no, no, listen. Oh. Ha ha ha. Thank heavens for my delicious sense of humor. You have your crooked keys, don't you? Natch. 'Alright, Sweet Sue. Find key 17. ' 'Do exactly as I tell you. ' - Gain level set. - Okay. Set the anti-theft systems. Let's go. Susie. Wow, am I ever glad to see you two. Just now, I saw a suspicious character in the gym. Quick! Run to safety. We'll take care of him. Wait, Batman, look, a machine. It's been tampered with. This might be tricky. Get out your Bat-a-rang. I'll slip in a dime. Holy ball and chain! Quick! Let's get out our cutting tools. The knock-out gas. Twelve and one half minutes later inside this curious vehicle. . It's all hooked up, boys. straight from the city main. Good. Gosh, Joker, this sure is some crazy mixed-up moving van. One of the assets of the One-Armed Bandit Novelty Company built for a whimsical Caribbean dictator. Happily for us if not for the Dynamic Duo. Uh, deposed before delivery. Oh, they're waking up. Careful no, my dimple darling. No names. I'll speak to them through this trick microphone that disguises our voices. 'Oh, what a paw. ' Holy Las Vegas! Where are we? 'In a strange kind of game room, boy blunder. ' Do you see the machine next to you? 'Right. ' 'It's going to spin around merrily and merrily. ' What's the payoff? Three liberty bells, your freedom. . and $50,000 cash. 'Three oranges, your freedom only. ' And if it's three lemons, which the percentages say is the more likely. electricity my fettered fatman. 'Automatically on the third lemon. ' Holy fruit salad. Sorry, I don't approve of gambling. 'Enough, my captured caped crusaders. ' I guarantee this machine is fair. So let the game commence. Horrors! One lemon. Double horrors! Two lemons. And if it's a third, instant and inescapable 50,000 volts. Close your eyes. Who dares to see it? Try us tomorrow, same Bat-time same Bat-channel.

Batman Gotham City. Another fine day. But on a side street, not so fine. A small fish store. Something smells and it's not last week's mackerel. Psst! Alfred, the butler. Get ready. No-no, Shark, you wanna warn him? Get that thing outta sight. Yes, sir. Can I help you? - Fresh fish today. - Well, that depends. I, uh, ran across this handbill advertising uh, cut rate caviar. Ooh, yes, sir. Right this way. - The best in town. - So I hope. I should never commit myself to serve anything but the best. How much ya need? A couple of ounces? Half a pound? my good man. A pound per guest. Now, uh, pardon me, ladies. Mmm, very mild. Now if it's all as good as this. . Why, what's the meaning of this? 'Help! Police! Help! Help!' Help! Help! My face! 'Yes, commissioner. ' Not only did some passers by see Alfred, the Wayne butler being carried to a waitin' car by hoodlums but the hoodlums had umbrellas. We found this one at the scene. - Notice what's on the tip. - Hmm? - Mmm, smells like caviar. - Hmm. There's no doubt, commissioner. No doubt or me name ain't. . - O'Hara. - Chief O'Hara. That's right. Umbrella is the absolute sign. . we're dealing with that waddling, pirate o' plunder the Penguin himself. Ordo we deal with him? Ya hit the nail right on the head, commissioner. Oh, any ordinary crook, the department can handle. But when it comes to the likes of the Penguin. . why there's only one being on earth. Yes, commissioner. What is it? Uh, thank heavens I got you, Batman. It's-it's the Penguin again. - A kidnapping. - The Penguin, eh? - Who's his victim this time? - Uh, Batman. You know Bruce Wayne, the multimillionaire of course. Of course. 'The Penguin's victim is none other than' 'Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred. ' Batman, are you there? Di-did you hear me? Yes, I heard you, commissioner. We'll join you at once. Who is it, Bruce? Has the Penguin kidnapped someone special? Dick, I'm afraid you better put your Latin verbs aside for now. - The missing man is Alfred. - Holy Wayne manor! - You don't mean our Alfred. - Yes, Dick. I mean our Alfred. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman, Batman Batman Batman, Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na Na-na na-na na Batman Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Roger, ready to move out. No doubt at all. It does indeed point to Penguin. Chief O'Hara, I congratulate you on your keen deduction. Hmm? Oh-oh, it was nothing. But what troubles me is what them hoodlums did with Alfred. They obviously took him somewhere. - Hmm. - Very strange. What is, Robin? I'm sure you've noticed, Batman. Alfred the butler has been kidnapped but there's no ransom demand. My thunderation! The lad is right. But, if it wasn't ransom that the Penguin's after, what then? I think I can answer that, Chief O'Hara. The multimillionaire's annual award dinner. You mean the one at which a dozen multimillionaires each donate a million dollars cash to a chosen charity? What does Alfred the butler have to do with that? It's not common knowledge but Alfred is the major domo at that affair. . and I happen to know that his employer Mr. Bruce Wayne attends that dinner every year. Batman, the location is kept secret to avoid publicity. The only ones who know. . - Oh! - Big pardon, boy wonder. If Alfred oversees the food and service he knows where it's held. And that means. . 'Exactly, Robin. ' That's what the Penguin is after. He kidnapped Alfred to force him to divulge the location of the dinner. Good thinking, Robin. And $12 million is nothing to sneeze at, even for Penguin. Come on, Robin. Let's race to the scene of the kidnapping. We may find a clue. 'But, Batman. The fish store is empty. ' It's-it's a false fish store. That's right. We checked it over from stem to stern. Meaning no offence, Chief O'Hara. Your department is the finest in the land. Butwhere you failed. . Robin and I may succeed. Ah! The dynamic duo. What would we do without them, O'Hara? Oh, commissioner. Don't even whisper it. Oh, I shudder to think of what might. . Uh-oh! I'm forgetting. Parking lot, clear all exits for the Batmobile. And meanwhile on Gotham City's waterfront. . the riverside rendezvous of the Penguin and his fine finny fiends. Seagoing scoundrels, all. - Octopus, more ink. - Coming, boss. What do you think, Penguin poopsy? It's lovely, Finella, my little pollywog, lovely. You are not even looking. You told me to practice and you'd make sure that I won a bathing beauty contest. You will, I'll see to that. It's all part and parcel of my piratical plan. But that'll come later. Right now, I have other fish to fry. Stop it, you ruffian. Don't do that. Talk. Where's this here multimillionaire dinner gonna be held? Maybe I oughta run this through you. Nay! You mineral brain. But, boss. I gotta make him tell. 'Tell what? He can't tell what he doesn't know. ' - Doesn't know? - Quite true. I do not know. And not that I'd tell you if I did. But, boss, if he don't have the answer, what good is he? Ugh! You don't comprehend my super calculated trickery. But you will. And so will you, Alfred, my boy. When I put you in the penguin box. And I'll teach you how to waddle like a Penguin. You're quite right. It's no secret now. Because the location of the dinner hasn't been decided upon. But when it has, you won't be a silent butler anymore. You'll be a babbling butler. Never, it simply isn't done to betray one's master. Exactly, exactly. And this penguin box will make me your master. - Everything ready? - 'All set, boss. ' Switch. Hey, zombie stuff. He's brainwashed. Precisely. As I say, my penguin box never fails. He's coming under my power. Now watch. You will remember none of this. "I will remember none of this. " What you will remember is. . the time. . "The time. . " 'and the place. . ' "And the place. . " of the multimillionaires dinner. "of the multimillionaires dinner. " - Is that clear? - 'Yes. ' - Yes what? - Yes. . sir. Only a smear of caviar. Chief O'Hara was right. Not a clue in sight. What's that on the floor, Robin? That crumpled piece of paper. Just an ad for this place. "Big sale, cut-rate caviar. First come, first served. " 'Look closer. The name of the proprietor. ' '"Not A Fish. "' - Not a fish? - Don't you see, Robin? - If he's not a fish-- - Of course! Holy subliminal! If he's not a fish, he must be the Penguin. Exactly! Good deduction. The bat-phone in the Batmobile. Remember, Robin, always look both ways. Yes? 'This is Commissioner Gordon, Batman. ' - What's wrong, commissioner? - Not a thing, Batman. For once I'm happy to say I'm the bearer of good news. I'm happy to tell you that Mr. Wayne's butler Alfred has not been kidnapped after all. Not kidnapped? What does he mean, Batman? I heard that, boy wonder. I mean, he has not been kidnapped. Alfred the butler has turned up? Safe and sound as a dollar. Ahem! And you'll never guess where. Right back home at the stately mansion of his employer millionaire Bruce Wayne. Thank you, commissioner. That's good news. Holy puzzlers, Batman! It's great that Alfred is safe. Butsomehow it sounds fishy to me. It certainly does, Robin. And the sooner we talk to Alfred ourselves the sooner we'll have the answers. Let's go. But of course I smell fishy, sir. One does not purchase without retaining a certain effluvium of fish eggs. I had to hang out my morning coat to air. But, Alfred, you were reported kidnapped. We just came from the fish store where they grabbed you. Fish store? What fish store? The one you went to, to purchase the caviar. I never went to any fish store, sir. I did as I always do. Purchased it direct through the Iranian embassy. Why? Is anything the matter, sir? - Where did you get that twitch? - Get what, sir? - Thattwitch. - Twitch, sir? What twitch? We'll never learn where the Penguin took him this way. Patience, there's more than one way to locate a criminal. Let's try the memory bat-bank on Alfred. Good idea. - Alfred. - Mm-hmm? Would you like to look at some photographs to see if you recognize some people? Photos? Oh, gladly, sir. Yes. 'A criminal type, sir, obviously. And a smooth one. ' They can be the most dangerous. - But not familiar. - No, sir. A total stranger. 'Also a total stranger. And I may add. ' 'I'm glad of it. ' Shark, hmm. An interesting appellation. - But you don't know him? - No. Never seen him before, sir. 'A rogue, if ever I saw one. ' Eh, but this is my first glimpse of him. Now, Alfred. . how about. . this one? 'Oh, a fiend, sir. Obviously, a perfect fiend. ' Uh, may one enquire as to his name? His name. . is Penguin. Penguin, hmm. Never seen him before, sir. Oh, uh, excuse me, sir. This is all most interesting but, uh. . In a few minutes your guests will be here. - Guests? - Yes, Master Robin. The multimillionaires. Alfred's right. The rehearsal dinner, we must be there. If we're not, it would be breach of good manners. Thank you for remembering, Alfred. Thank you, sir. A good butler never forgets. Oh, the crabmeat canapes. I must pop them in the oven right away. Good idea, this rehearsal. The ladies are such worthy causes. I personally favor Miss, uh. . Natural Resources. I'd like to make her my own personal charity. All are worthy. Uh, you can say that again. And that is Bruce Wayne's grandfather, Mrs. Cooper? His great grandfather. I understand he was tapped for skull and bones. Tapped for it? Sir, he founded skull and bones. - Uh, canape, miss? - Oh, no, thank you. I have to watch my figure. I quite understand. How do we decide where we have dinner? By vote as usual in the democratic way. - Uh, canapes, sir? - Don't mind if I do. Hey, what's this? A fish hook. I'm terribly sorry, sir. It must have fallen out of my morning coat. - Your morning coat? - Uh, yes, sir. The one I wore this morning when I was preparing the canapes. Excuse me a moment. Sir, please do have another. I can assure you. . Fallen from his morning coat. The one he wore. Yes, this morning when the Penguin grabbed him. A clue, Dick. Quickly, back to the bat-cave. A fish hook. Clearly that must mean. . 'a water front. ' 'Holy fog! Of course. ' Where on the waterfront? It runs for a 146 miles. You're forgetting the other clue, Robin. "Not a fish" proprietor. Let's see if the same name pops up for a fishing pier. 'No. ' '"A fish. " That's it!' 'South Pier. Let's go!' Gosh, Batman. It just occurred to me. What if Penguin's prepared for us? - I hope he's not. - But if he is? That's a chance we have to take, Robin. We waitin' for somebody, boss? - Boss, it's the Batmobile. - Yes! Batman and Robin. I knew that that fish hook would fetch them. - You knew? - You mean Th-th-they'll grab us. It's the finish. The finish for them, not for us, my quaking cohorts. But they're not captured yet. If I may coin a phrase there's many a slip, so zipper your lip. Here they come. Inside. Out of sight. Finella, what're you doing? Gee! Batman is handsome. What I can make out under the mask. What you can make, my dear, is make yourself scarce! You may as well give yourself up, Penguin. Will you close your gills? Holy clockwork! What next? It proves he's here. Come on, Robin. Where is he? Pengy-baby, I'm just not sure that this is the right bathing suit. No! Look, boss, they're still breathing. So, they are, eh? We'll remedy that by putting them in the. . vacuum tank. Not the vacuum tank, boss. It ain't human. Hmm, no-no, it ain't. Well, come on, you mutt headed finks. Follow me. Greetings, dynamic duo. '"Enough for all. " But not for long. ' Come on, you finny finks. Keep the bellows working. 'Oh, how awful. ' Yes, isn't it? Hand me that. Wake up, caped-crusader. Yes, Batman. The air is growing thinner. 'And as it does the balloons will begin to expand and burst. ' 'So you watch the balloons Batman. ' 'When all of them have burst' 'the two of you will be finished. ' Can this be happening to the dynamic duo? How can they live? Will they be vanquished by a vacuum? Revive, Robin! Breathe Batman! We'll hold our breath for you both. Until tomorrow night. Same time, same channel. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman, Batman Batman Batman, Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman 
Batman A quiet peaceful night in Gotham City. Except at the First National Bank at exactly 8:37. Hold it. Hands up. Don't move. Escaped, gentlemen. Thanks to a bulletproof vest escaped clean as hound's tooth. with precisely one hundred thousand in cash. Need I tell you what this means? The devil of an unknown bandit. The one who strikes every April the 1st for exactly a hundred grand. Correct, Chief O'Hara. Well, the third year running an identical pattern. Got a call from the president of the Gotham City League of Banks. He told me bluntly the league is becoming uneasy. Sure and I don't blame them. A fine bunch of April fools we're looking. Oh, don't castigate yourselves. You're tip-top officers, all of you. But still. . two years on this case and you men haven't turned up a single clue. Any reason to think you'll do better this time? This one is bigger than the lot of us. Commissionerwe need help. Yes, I'm inclined to agree. Ascend to the roof, Chief O'Hara, turn on the Bat-signal. - Yes, sir. - I'll try the hotline. No one to answer the Bat-phone. Because Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson along with Alfred the butler are on the roof of Wayne Manor. . stargazing. How's that, Master Dick? Fine, thanks, Alfred. Wow, the rings of Saturn. This is sure some fun, Bruce. Astronomy is more than mere fun, Dick. - It is? - Yes. It helps give us a sense of proportion. Reminds us how little we are really. People tend to forget that sometimes. Gosh, yes, that's right. I'll bet I'll see those rings a little differently this time. If you boys have finished stargazing there's a delicious rib roast on the dining room table. Just one more minute, Aunt Harriet. Goodness gracious, look up at that cloud. Isn't that the famous Bat-signal? 'It sure is, Aunt Harriet. ' Commissioner Gordon must wish the services of the, ahem, Dynamic Duo. Mercy alive. Whoever that unknown Batman is I hope he sees the signal. Uh, great heavens, what a fool I am. - Isn't today Wednesday, Alfred? - Indeed, sir. Wednesday night, Gotham Town hall. We have tickets to that lecture on Latin-American affairs. Holy Venezuela, you're right. If we dash, we can catch part of it. - Excuse us, Aunt Harriet. - Goodnight, Aunt Harriet. Oh, and don't worry about Dick's supper, Aunt Harriet. We'll have some good, hot pancakes later. Dick Grayson. Running out on a rib roast for a lecture in politics? Alfred, get ready to catch me. I think I'm gonna faint. My pleasure, madam. Sorry about the holdup. What's the problem? You-you just said it yourself, Batman. - "A holdup. " Big. - We're on our way. To the Bat-poles. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Well, one clue that slug from the guard's pistol after it ricocheted from the bandit's bulletproof vest. We hoped that it might contain identifiable fibers from the bandit's clothing. - No luck, eh? - Our hopes were blasted. Lab report, negative. I'll take this anyway. Our own equipment at the Bat-cave may prove more revealing. Meantime, let's ponder the crook's motive. A hundred thousand smackers. That's the motive. But why? Why exactly one hundred thousand dollars? Leaving another half million untouched. Batman's right. That has some meaning. The same strange pattern every year. Precisely a hundred thousand each April 1st. Glory be, I've got it. It's to pay his income taxes. A loyal taxpayer stooping to criminal methods? Uh, sure, when you put it that way. I fear you're growing cynical, Chief O'Hara. The notion of a faithful taxpayer robbing a bank is absurd. It's this case that's driving me mad. 'We're up against a blank wall. ' Not even a single lead. Right, Robin. So what do we do in such a case? - We make a lead. - 'Exactly. ' "Make a lead?" In heaven's name, Boy Wonder, how? Don't worry. Batman will figure it out. Won't you, Batman? Operator, this is Batman speaking. Get me the editor of the Gotham City Times. I have a scheme to throw our enemies into confusion. I'm going to plant a story. Extra, extra. Get your newspaper here. Read about the bandit who stole the counterfeit money. Yes, that's what he did. Counterfeit money. Friend, what was counterfeit money doing in the vault of the First National Bank? If you wanna know, buy a paper. I ain't no special news service. I wonder what it was doing there? Oh, "Awaiting at the bank for disposal. " Makes sense. Hey, paper here. Read about the bandit who stole the counterfeit money. Here. Read about it, right now. How are you doing with that bullet, Batman? 'Amazing. Come here and look. ' Any trace of what the crook was wearing? Wow. Those are fiber patterns, alright. Notice from left to right. First, nylon coveralls. Next, what seems to beorange wool. And silk. Unless I'm crazy, about ten layers of different colored silks. Square on the button, Robin. This bullet passed through 13 layers of brightly-colored silk. Holy rainbow. - Who'd wear a rig like that? - Let me show you a clue. Gosh, that's a stumper. I think it's organic, though. Correct, the unmistakable spectrographic pattern of ambergris. Ambergris? You mean that smelly, oily stuff they use in making perfumes? Correct again, which leads to only one possible conclusion. - The crook was a lady. - Hardly a lady, Robin. - But female, yes. - The Catwoman? No, impossible. She's safely up the river. - Then who could she be? - I don't know. I thinkwe're faced with some new super-criminal not in our crime file. - Yes, Batman. - Here's a tip, commissioner. Alert the entire force. Be on the lookout for a woman in an orange dress. Good heavens, a woman. What is the world coming to? We can't stop to worry about that now. Our task is to fight crime. Goodbye for now. The morning newspaper, sir. It just arrived. Ah, good. Thanks. I want to read this. My pleasure, sir. Uh, excuse me, sir. Would you and Master Robin be departing soon? - Oh, indeed, we will. - Thank you, sir. Then I'll go and get the vacuum cleaner. Looks perfect, Batman. Yep, it's all there. Just the way I dictated it. Oh, boy. I'll bet somewhere in Gotham City there's one really shook lady crook. I hope so, Robin. Now to make this planted story sprout. Meanwhile, behind the facade of this innocent-looking bookstore there lurks the secret workshop of a strange Albanian genius. . Eivol Ekdal. Sorry to be late, Eivol. Counterfeit you bring me. To me, Eivol Ekdal, worthless counterfeit. Look. How could I know, Eivol? "How could I know, Eivol?" "Zelda the Great. Even greater than Houdini. " Without the marvelous escape devices which I Eivol Ekdal made for you each year you would be nothing. Stop taunting me. I've always paid you well, haven't I? I've even taken up a life of crime to pay your price. Poor Zelda. And I suppose, it offends your lofty principles, huh? But it does, Eivol. I hate robbing banks. And all I ever wanted to be was a poorbut honest magician. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Aww. I thought so. A glycerin tear producer. And now, my conscience-stricken little crocodile wipe away those disgusting phony tears 'and let's talk sensibly, huh?' But what am I going to do, Eivol? Hmm, that is the question. My act's been slipping, you know. If I don't come up with a super-sensational escape this yearI'm finished. Such bad luck that you're stuck with those counterfeits. Such unusually bad luck. For you see. . Yes? I had it all prepared for you, Zelda. Guaranteed without question the most super-sensational escape device ever invented. Even by me, Eivol Ekdal. Oh, show me. Well, since you can't pay my price of one hundred thousand dollars I hardly see the point. Well, alright. Behold, Eivol Ekdal's inescapable doom trap. A cage constructed of utterly unbreakable jet-age plastic. Will they believe that? Of course. Before you get inside you will demonstrate. I'll show you. Duck behind the trunk. Oh, it's fantastic. The plastic isn't even scratched. Of course, I told you. It's unbreakable. Please, come up on the stage. Examine more closely. Step inside. The hinged wall is closed and padlocked by member of the audience. From the floor grill is pouring a deadly-colored gas. The audience is screaming for you to escape. How do you do it? Why, it's too simple. I lift the iron grill slip out a trapdoor. The colored gas conceals my actions. Pleasetry it. - Oh! - It's shocking, eh? Oh, the grill's electrified. Violently. Oh, it's wonderful. Oh, wonderful. Now, tell me. . what's the secret of my getting out? My dear, you don't even get in until I get my money. But I will give you one hint. The secret of my doom trap involves. . Guess who? The Caped Crusader, Batman. - Batman? - Mm-hmm. Oh, but you must be mad, Eivol. He's a sworn enemy of crooks like us. But he's also, what you only pretend to be the worlds greatest escape artist. - Ah! - Mm-hmm. Yes. Now I begin to see. In perfect working order, Batman. All systems A-Okay. Right. Bait for the mousetrap. Let's go. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Clear. Ready to move out. Not one more word until I get my hundred thousand dollars. Well, how will I find it? They'll be watching all the banks like hawks. Please. Read the newspaper again. Please. "The Star of Samarkand. " - That fabulous emerald. - Exactly. It will be at Stonewin's Jewelry on display one day only. Not quite as convenient as cash but quite acceptable. Quick, let me think. I'll, uh, I'll need equipment. Oh, please, consider the contents of my humble secret workshop as yours. - A trick mirror. - Yes. - A disguise. - Hmm. And a set of. . - Wait a minute. - What is the matter? - Ha ha. Batman. - Oh? You're a strange Albanian genius, Eivol but you're also bit of a fool. Don't you see, this is almost a bit too convenient? What do you mean? My feminine intuition tells me I better have two strings to my bow. The Star of Samarkand. . it could be a typical Batman trap. How does it look, Ms. Stonewin? I beg your pardon? This emerald of ours, does it look life-like? Oh, yes, the emerald. - Do you feel alright, ma'am? - Hmm? Oh, yes. Certainly. It's just that I've read so often about you and Batman in the press and well the experience of actually viewing you in the flesh is faintly faint-making. Please, Ms. Stonewin, there's no reason to be disturbed. That's right. Behind our mask, we're perfectly ordinary people. This unique garb of ours is one of our weapons in crime fighting. It shouldn't bother anyone who abides by the law. Of course. Do forgive me. You were saying about that synthetic emerald. Bait, Ms. Stonewin. Green cheese to trap a dangerous female bandit. - We need your cooperation. - Oh, just name it, Batman. I'll do it. Our scheme is to conceal ourselves somewhere on the premises. Just upstairs. That balcony, Batman. Perfect. When the crook strikes, we'll pounce on our prey. Even if she eludes us, we've still got her. Robin's right. The inside of the Star of Samarkand is hollow, you see. It contains a tiny super-power homing transmitter. We'll pick up the beam in our Batmobile. You're nearly simply too much, Batman. I hope so, Ms. Stonewin. Too much for this crook anyway. Robin, run outside, take a final check. Roger. In the street, Ms. Stonewin. Look. 'Two of Chief O'Hara's finest patrolmen' 'in the guise of power company workers. ' 'And under the tent. . ' our trump card. The Batmobile. As I guessed, another Batman trap. I'll have to get my hundred thousand somewhere else. Somewhere Batman wouldn't even dream of. And if it's games they want, they'll have 'em. Do you read me, Batman? Loud and clear. Emerald's working. All systems go. Alright, come back inside. We'll hide on the balcony. Over and out. Roger. Traps and counter traps. Back in the front hall of Stately Wayne Manor. . Mr. Wayne's residence. What? Dick Grayson struck in the head with a batted ball? Oh, dear. I'll get there at once. Which playground is it? Oh, you've already sent a special taxi to pick me up? Why, that's very kind of you, Ms. . What did you say your name was? Ms. Smith? Play-playground matron. Uh, thank you, Ms. Smith. Thank you so much. I'll be waiting out in front. It's been almost two hours. Could we have made a mistake? - I don't see how. - Me neither. But still we're only human. Good morning, madame. Would you care to see the Star of Samarkand? Ah, yes, I, uh, I would indeed, young lady. This way please. - Look. - The old lady in black. Oh! It's amazing. It looks almost real, doesn't it? What? 'Surrender!' 'We've got you, bank bandit. ' Holy hole in a doughnut! What happened? She's a master illusionist. She projected a false image with those tiny mirrors in her hat. - The emerald's gone. - And so are all my customers. Officer Clancy, alert the entire force. Unwrap the Batmobile. Don't worry. We'll get her. Batman, look, in the gutter. Fake emerald with our homing transmitter. She threw it away. The tricky, little she-devil. She must have smelled our trap. She was merely taunting us. So what's her real game? Hey, Batman, your Bat-phone's blinking. - Batman here. - Shocking news, Batman. Your scheme has worked, but not quite the way you planned. - What do you mean? - Your counterfeit story. It's driven the felon to strike again. 'Not at the Star of Samarkand. She's pulled a kidnap. ' - Who? - A Mrs. Harriet Cooper. What? Oh, a-a clever choice of victim, Batman. This Mrs. Cooper is the aunt of young Dick Grayson who's the ward of millionaire, Bruce Wayne. Great heavens! Has there been a ransom note? That's the worst of it, Batman. We've received a note with instructions for one hundred thousand dollars to be delivered within one hour. One hour only. And no one can find Bruce Wayne. Holy backfire. What have they done to poor Aunt. . What have they done to that Mrs. Cooper? Holy backfire's right! Aunt Harriet has just one hour. What'll it be? Splash or salvation? Hold a hopeful breath for Aunt Harriet until tomorrow night. Same Bat-time. Same Bat-channel. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman 
NARRATOR". The Gotham City 100 racingdom's most exciting spectacle, is half over. Four hundred thousand people have jammed into the Gotham City Speedway to witness the proceedings. At this point, Grimaldi Smith dean of America's drivers holds a comfortable six-minute lead over his international competition. Make one false move you got another mouth where your nose used to be. Keep the grubby hands towards the sky, fellas. All right, let's burn the breeze and hightail it out of here. Who was that man? I'm not quite sure, but he left this platinum bullet. Platinum bullet? Only one man uses a platinum bullet. You mean? No doubt about it, Chief O'Hara. Shame has come back to taunt us with his Western wiliness. Ha. What a frightening felony, rustling the most expensive automobile in racing. You heard about the other robberies? The hot rod and the go-cart? Yes, I know about them. However, they were simple car thefts so handled easy enough by our department. But this? Ha, ha. This sheds an entirely new light on the affair. You think Shame stole them too? No doubt about it. Only one man would have the unmitigated gall to pilfer an automobile and have it witnessed by more than 800,000 eyes. - What do we do now, commissioner? -What do we do? What can we do? You know as well as I that this can only be handled by one far wiser than we. And in stately Wayne Manor Bruce, that's wonderful, so exciting. The trick is to make the cars go slow so they don't fall off the track on the curves. It's child's play once you get the hang of it. I guess I still haven't gotten it. That's three in a row you've beaten me. Makes no difference if you win or lose. It's how you play the game. It's easier to say that when you win. - Ahem, sir? - Yes, Alfred. You have an appointment with a Mr. Red Amici, sir. - Man from the phone company? -One and the same, Master Dick. - Golly. -Can't keep him waiting, can we? - No, sir. -Why don't you try it, Aunt Harriet? Now, what was it he said about not falling off the track? - Yes, commissioner? -There were three auto thefts in Gotham City today. That should be simple enough for your fine force. It would be, except that all clues point to the redoubtable road agent. The bloodthirsty bushwhacker. Shame himself. We'll be right there. To the Batpoles. The nerve of some of these criminals never ceases to astound me, Batman. Shame never was one for modesty. All of his crimes have a certain flair, a certain bravado. Not unlike the Western criminals of yesteryear. And you say those three stray cars were rounded up? That's right, Caped Crimebuster but there's something downright devilish about the whole thing. What is that, Chief O'Hara? Well, instead of rustling the entire car, he took just one item from each of them then abandoned the rest of the automobile. Holy jigsaw puzzles. He purloined the 28-barrel carburetor from Grimaldi Smith's racer. Some custom-made alloy pistons from the engine of the go-cart. And some milled heads from a hot rod. Why would anyone just steal bits and pieces of cars rather than one entire auto? That is the question. And he left this platinum bullet behind. Platinum is not easy to come by these days. Perhaps we can trace it on our Precious Metals Bat-Analyzer. Let's go, Robin. We've nary a second to lose. Vamonos. Right, amigo. - Feel better, O'Hara? -Much. Ha-ha-ha. So do I. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in Westernland a deserted and bankrupt movie studio on the edge of Gotham City Shame has another ax to grind. Good. When I lay my paws on Batman and Robin I'm gonna crease their skulls so hard with this they'll be known as the Dynamic Foursome. Good idea. I'm gonna pour me three fingers of this here tonsil varnish. I reckon that's why they call me Messy James, huh? Okie Annie, quit pounding your fingers and get over here. Shame, how much longer you reckon before this here truck's ready to roam in the range? Soon enough, dumpling. Just as soon as I get the rest of the making for that there motor. And when I do, this here truck's gonna go 300 miles per - Day? -Hour! Last time I was in Gotham City, that goldarn Batmobile followed me all over, finally cut me off at a concrete pass. Caused me to spend quite a spell up the river. Well, I don't aim to have that happen no more. Shame, honey it ain't so much the car, it's the fellas what drive it. Good. If all goes well, them two will be pushing up daisies pretty soon. But just in case they ain't, I want that there truck to make that there Batmobile look like a turtle with arthritis. When you've got plans as big as mine, babyâ. you gotta cover all the angles. And the biggest angle of all is a clean, quick getaway. Hey, someone's a-coming! Get away. Howdy, barkeep. My handle's Andy Stevens. Perhaps you've heard of me, the Pecos Kid? I got 12 notches on my gun and they ain't there because I like whittling. If you get what I mean. Let me have some of your best red eye and leave the bottle. Yes, sir. Mommy! Just as I suspected, Robin. An ordinary lead bullet coated with platinum paint. It's no help at all. Let's try another tack. Shame has stolen a carburetor, pistons and milled heads. - Now, what does that suggest to you, Robin? -He's building an engine. Why go to all this trouble when it's less dangerous to buy one? Why, indeed, Robin. However, these are not ordinary automotive components. They're highly sophisticated not readily available at your local garage. - No. There's a method to his misdemeanors. -I've got it. He wants to enter in the Gotham City Grand Prix next month for the $100,000 prize. Good thinking, old chum. Now, if you were building a super engine, what else would you need? - A special camshaft and valve lifters. -Precisely. I think this calls for a clever ruse. Such as? Hot Rod Harry, dean of Gotham City's disc jockeys the man who knows all there is to know about cars. Please, get me radio station KGC. Yes, siree, baby. We play the pick of the pack the best in wax and shellac for all you guys and gals out there in radioland. Let's move right along now with a tune that was written this morning and already it's number three. Do you hear me? On the KGC survey here in Gotham City's ville. It's "Desert Sands" by Lawrence and the Arabians. Hot Rod Harry, your musical maestro. - Hello, Harry, this is Bruce Wayne. - Hi, Brucey, baby. Hey, you're the fellow that endowed the drag strip in the suburbs. Keep the kids off the streets. That's right, Harry. Could you do me a small favor? A radio announcement. Cool daddy. Ha, ha. And that's from the guy who's saying yes who makes the top decisions and plays the tops and pops. And also some of the old-time tunes right here on KGC, number one radio in Gotham City. Say, that's right good, Mr. Shame but how come you only use one gun while the rest of your friends have two? A fella only needs one gun, Andy, if he knows how to use it proper. Golly, you're pretty handy with that peacemaker, mighty fast. Well, partner, a fella had to be handy with a six-gun where I came from. Boot Hill was filled with fellas who pull the trigger before they took aim. Many a buckaroo took the long jump because he had a case of slow. Hey, all you chicks and chucks out there. You all remember Brucey Wayne, the cat came up with the scratch for the drag strip? Well, he just had his limousine all revamped. That's what I said, had the man put on a hand-made camshaft and some special imported new valve lifters. Now, that's real class. He'll be showing the car next week at the auto show. So all you Johns and Janes kind of fall by, huh? I hear it makes that car go Hey, that's what we need to finish off that there stallion. - What now, boss? -Okie Annie you gotta bushwhack this here Wayne fellow and get his cayuse. -Do tell. Little Shorthorn, we're gonna have to hit the trail now. I'm gonna borrow that radio from you because I gotta hear that disc jockey fella and get some more of them hot rod tips. All right, amigos. Let's go. Hey, wait a minute! Come back, Shame! Come back, Shame! Shame, come back! Boy, I sure hope Shame bites the bait. Bait, Master Dick? I'm hoping the house is being watched this very moment. Expect to be held up within the hour. My word, isn't that rather dangerous, sir? It's our only hope of catching Shame. All other clues have been exhausted. Let's go, Dick. There they go. We'll follow and then strike while the branding iron is still hot. You gonna kill them, boss? Only if they give me any backwash. One millionaire more or less ain't gonna be missed by nobody. Gosh, Bruce, uh, I've never been in a place like this before. Maybe we should have checked Aunt Harriet's shopping list closely before we volunteered. - What do you think we should do? -Press on. May I help you? Yes, we're looking for something in, uh-- Uh, eh-- Uh, something in lingerie. I see. Exactly what sort of lingerie? Well, it's, um-- I-- I think one would-- How would you say it, Dick? Well, it's like-- It's-- He wants a full slip, size 38, white and washable. Yes. Well, thank you, Miss? - Okie Annie. -Miss Annie. Aren't you millionaire, Bruce Wayne? And aren't you his youthful ward, Dick Grayson? How did you know? Well, I've seen your picture in the paper a whole passel of times. And I could use your help. Turnabout is fair play. What do you need? My car is down in the parking lot just plumb tuckered out and I'm down to my last chip. -Mm-hm. - Do you need some money? - No. No, just a lift over to Pointview Street. I mean, I couldn't ask just anyone, but I reckon on account of you're so trustworthy because of the nice things I read in the paper about what your foundation does. We can arrange that, can't we, Dick? - We sure can. -I could kiss you for that. Oh, here, hold this. Come on, let's go. Ha! Good. So, boss. Come on, bossy. Come on. What's a nice cow like you doing in a place like this? - Unh. -Reach. - So this was all a trick. -You bet your boots. Now, you keep your hands raised, don't fuss an inch you might live a while longer, get it? - Got it. -Good. All right, let's split. Why didn't we try to stop them? They did exactly as I'd hoped. - But now we're stuck here. -Watch. I had the remote control unit keep the Batcycle at a safe distance. It's been following us all the time. Amazing, but what if someone sees us on the Batcycle? We're a mile away from the entrance to the Batcave. Allow me, sir. Thank you. And I know a circuitous route over a deserted path. - There you are, Alfred, the Alf-cycle. -Thank you, sir. Good bye. I took the precaution of coating the limousine's tires with an Infrared Bat Dust which glows by day as well as by dark. But you must look at it through the Batmobile's specially tinted windshield. Let's go. To the Batcave. Good. There. That about does it. You still think this will haul all that weight and still outrace the Batmobile? This thing will be doing 100 while that thing's still in first gear. Besides, it don't make no difference. Batman and Robin won't know where we are or where to find us. Them two is long gone over the hill. - Don't that beat all? -Look out, Batmobile! Here comes the hay burner! The best laid plans of mice and men aft gang agley. - Who's that? -You'd better come quietly, Shame. Let's drill him, boss. Holster your hardware, fellas. Wouldn't want no stray bullets hitting this here truck after all this work. And all that money facing us. We ain't got a chance against the Dynamic Duo. Leastwise not without guns. Talking to you is like talking pig latin to a donkey. We got them outnumbered. Three and a half-to-two. Now, let's hang up their hides. - Mr. Shame? -Yeah? What do you want, Andy? - My radio. -Well, you beat it, beat it. Is that Batman and Robin on the floor? Yeah, what about it? Did you hurt them? No, I didn't hurt them. Now, come on, Mr. Pecos Kid. We-- We're just doing a little show here for the TV. We're just doing a little playacting. Now, come on. But where are the cameras? It's hidden, it won't be in the way like you are. Come on, go. - Skedaddle. Come on. -Okay. Could've fooled me. Good. Looks like we got them by the cape, buckaroos. Now nothing's gonna stand in our way. - You gonna shoot them in cold blood, Shame? -No, that wouldn't be sport. - So, what you gonna do? -Got a little plan. I'll bet you are probably wondering what all this is for. That thought did cross my mind. Pretty soon I'm gonna shoot this trusty six-shooter of mine and when I do, a herd of cattle is gonna come stomping this way in a mighty big hurry. Holy stampede! Now, those cows don't stop coming for no man. Not even you, Bat Fella. And when they get through stomping there ain't gonna be enough of you left to put in a thimble. Shame on you, Shame. Watch your tongue. Hasta la vista, partners. I'll tell everybody you died with your Bat Boots on. 
NARRATOR". We have already seen Gotham City's charter stolen by the rottenest egg of them all, Egghead. Gordon and O'Hara with egg on their faces. Batman and Robin answer their weekly call. The city really owned by the Mohican Indians and only leased by the citizens. Nine pelts paid every five years to renew the lease or it will egg-xpire. Was this Eggheads plan? It was. Chief Screaming Chicken, last of the Mohicans, gave his word. But he was an Indian giver. Batman and Robin attack. A millionaire kidnapped. Another millionaire kidnapped. Our millionaire kidnapped. Egghead suspects that Bruce Wayne is Batman. Will this fiendish machine vacuum his brain? Holy hypothesis! The Caped Crusader held in his chair by electromagnetic power. Can this really be happening? Let this serve as a warning to anyone with a delicate nature. The most egg-xcruciating circumstances are yet to come. Four seconds and you'll be as helpless as a newborn babe. Ha, ha. How egg-xotic. Nice going, Dick. I thought I was a goner. Well, was--? Is he? Is he? Only a bit of information trickled through before that accursed teenager turned the switch. - And? -That man has a mind full of trivia. It's inconceivable that he could be Batman. Back, back, I say. This is a radar egg. And the slightest vibration will make it egg-xplode and turn this into a room carpeted with wall-to-wall millionaires. Let's get out of here. It's two minutes before midnight and the lease is about to egg-xpire. Nothing can stop us now. We have only one chance. This type of mechanism is only sensitive up to about 6 feet. Do exactly as I do. We just can't leave that bomb there, Bruce. Some innocent bystander might get hurt. Correct. Therefore we must trigger that mechanism before we leave. - Tim, Pete, wait outside. -But-- - Please, please, there's no time to lose. -Okay. - Now what? -We play marbles. Marbles? I heard Egghead say he didn't think you were Batman. And the machine worked, didn't it? Only too well, Dick. After years of mental conditioning I was able to block off that portion of my brain pertaining to my dual identity. I couldn't have lasted much longer, though. All right, let's get down. You got it on the first shot. At the age of 11, I was junior marble champion of Gotham City. - Even then. -Let's go. I can't conceive of what happened to those three millionaires. It's all too incredible, but Gotham City now belongs to Chief Screaming Chicken. You better believe it, buddy. Oh. - What happened to you? -A long story. Are we--? Too late. Midnight came and went, and with it the fate of Gotham City. You no show up, me now own Gotham City and all suburbs. That is the way the Wigwam watusies. But is it legal, Mr. Mayor? - I'm afraid so, Batman. -Even though Egghead kidnapped the millionaires and held them until after midnight? That's against the law. Boy Wonder, there is no more law in Gotham City. We're at his mercy. We must give him enough rope, commissioner. And let him be hoist by his own petard. Trust me. Batman, we're in your hands like we've never been before. Correction. You are in my hands. This is my official contract with Chief Screaming Chicken. And it gives me complete control of Gotham City as his emissary. You fiendish devil. Egg-xpletives will get you nowhere, my cowled crime-buster. The Gotham City Charter is back in its case and it's quite egg-xplicit, if you care to read it. You'll have to talk a little slower, Eggy-pooh if I'm going to capture all your wisdom on paper. You think anybody will buy his book on how to be a better criminal? -Quiet. My first duty as new leaseholder of Gotham City is hereby to fire the mayor and the police commissioner. You can't do that. Oh, yes, I can. You are through. Finished. Fired. Up. Out. Out. Over. Up. Out. We're witnessing a new low in community relations, Robin. And as for you, my caped incompetents I hereby egg-xpell you from the Gotham City limits. If you so much as show your masks around here again I'll have you both egg-xecuted. This is the saddest day of my young life, Batman. What Will be, Will be. Goodbye, Gotham City. You were my kind of town. If Batman and Robin ever come back to Gotham City they'll be shot on sight. - Ain't that great? -Hold your egg-xuberance, Foo. My amazing brain tells me that we haven't seen the last of them yet. We gotta move fast, Robin. The longer Egghead is in control of Gotham City, the more chaos will erupt. What will we do? We're barred. This is one time when Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson can do more good than Batman and Robin. -How? Egghead said the city charter is back in its resting place. My training in legal matters has taught me that every document has some fine print that is usually overlooked. Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are going to steal the charter. Wow, talk about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Stop them! Stop them! They've just stolen $50,000 worth of precious jewels. I'm sorry, sir. Commissioner Egghead says we're not allowed to arrest his friends. Well, if you won't do anything about it, I will. Sir. Sir, come back here, please. - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to give you a ticket. -A ticket? For what? Jaywalking. I don't understand. Murderers and thieves are making Gotham City an unfit place to live in and you stopped me to tell me to fasten my seatbelt. I'm just doing my job, sir. With all the noise and the shooting and everything going on who could blame me for missing that litter basket with my tissue? Just the facts, ma'am. Will you please give me just the facts? REPORTER : It's 3:00 in Gotham City, and time for the 11th hour news. Our town is in an uproar. Robberies are taking place all over Gotham City and the police are powerless to stop them. Commissioner Egghead seems to take great delight at the happenings. The big question is, where are Batman and Robin? Even though they've been banned from the city limits all Gotham City is hoping for them to help us in our hour of need. Things may have gotten somewhat out of hand, Dick. Why don't we take a nice drive into the city? - Great. -Is that wise, sir? We have no other choice. How are we going to open it? We'll have to break the case. Why don't you use the Batbeam in the spare utility belt you wear? If I did, Egghead might suspect Batman. No, we'll use ordinary means. They fell into the trap. Oh, I am egg-static. Ha-ha-ha. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Be on the lookout for Batman and Robin in the vicinity of the city hall. Well, gentlemen when we capture the caped crime-Crushers we will remove their masks and egg-xpose their faces to the public. Then they will be out of business. I wonder who they are? Well, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson. I'm surprised you came to Gotham City the way things are going. We had some business to attend to. Did you happen to see Batman and Robin around the area? Commissioner Egghead has given my men orders to shoot them on sight. I haven't seen Batman for weeks. Well, thanks anyhow. There it is. The clause we've been looking for. "If the heirs to Gotham City's lease fail to make payment on the approved day said property reverts to the Mohican Indians and/or their legal representatives. The only stipulation to this clause is that the property may never be leased to anyone who's committed crimes against the city, territory, or the crown. " In those days we were still a British colony. What does it mean, Batman? It means we've got that criminal by his large, gray, double-A head. I don't think he'll be satisfied with half the loot collected by the visiting gangs, Robin. - He must have something bigger in mind. -What could it be? Think, Robin, think. Where is all the money in Gotham City kept? In the treasury, of course. With the tax just having been collected there must be close to $30 million in that vault. Right, Robin. And what's a synonym for the word "treasury"? Depository? Strong room? Bursary? Of course, the English word for "treasury. " Exchequer . -Or eggs-chequer. - Oh, you've done it again. -To the Batmobile. Here I am with 29 million George Washingtons, and I don't feel the least bit crowded. And the beautiful part about it is all of this money is tax-exempt. Me think you are crooks. Me go tell the mayor. Oh, but my dear egg-xalted chief, you are the mayor. - Ha, ha. -Oh. Oh, you're right. Me have short memory span. I say, Foo Yung, will you loan me a couple of hundred thousand or so? Of course, my dear. Here you are. Pay me back whenever you can find the time. I'm in no hurry. Perfumes from Paris and dresses from Rome. And my very own handsome guardsman from Buckingham Palace. You know, one of those men who don't giggle when you tickle them. And now-- And now to egg-xpedite matters, let's start packing this stuff up. Ha, ha! Is this the way it's all supposed to end, Mayor Linseed? Not with a bang, but, uh, with a whimper? We're like two old warhorses being put out to pasture. I never thought I'd see the day. And you haven't. Batman, Robin, you realize you're taking a grave chance by coming here? - That's why we took the surreptitious route. -Egghead's got a price on your cowl. The person bringing you in, dead or alive, gets $50,000. - Holy recompense. -That's all over now. A clause in the city charter refutes anything Egghead might have planned. It specifically prohibits criminals from leasing any of Gotham City. - Splendid news, Batman. -What now? It's my guess that Egghead and his men had another crime in mind. - We think they're going to loot the treasury. -And we're going there right now. Clear all police channels for an emergency message. This is Commissioner Gordon speaking. Men, I have wonderful news for you. Batman and Robin are back. We no longer have to take any of Eggheads guff because he no longer has a legal hold on our fair city. Batman and Robin were gone from our ranks less than 24 hours, Mayor Linseed. And you were a witness to the havoc that was wrought. Call them the Dynamic Duo, the caped crime-fighters, the foes of felons. Call them what you will. But thank your lucky stars we can call them our friends. - We better hurry, Batman. -Not too fast, Robin. In good Batclimbing, as in good driving, one must never sacrifice safety for speed. Right again, Batman. Who are you, citizen? Oh, my name Jose Jimenez. And who, may I ask, are you two nice people climbing down the side of this building when the elevators are available? - I'm Batman. - And I'm Robin. Ah, oh. I'm the foreman of a jury. We're trying to make up our minds what to do to a terrible nasty criminal person, you know. - Oh. - Trying to find out now. Excuse me. Oh, you decided? What? Oh. Fellas, could you leave the rope? Gone. Every penny is gone. - Holy banks. -Almost $30 million in small bills. Oh! Oh, Mr. Masked Man, you are so right. That Egghead, one very bad hombre. - Where did he go, Chief Screaming Chicken? -He leave me to hold them bag while he escape. -But where? He say he must replenish before he go to South America. Then they all lay high. Lay low. Lay low, yeah. Me wrong on direction, yeah. He say he lay low for one day and then pretty soon maybe they all leave. Any particular place in South America? Oh, he say he take money, all the money, and run Venezuela. Chief Screaming Chicken, I think you've been led down a primrose path. My face is so red. Robin, tell Commissioner Gordon to alert all land, sea and air exits from Gotham City. We must keep Egghead within the city limits until we find out where his hideout is. Hm. Roger. Boy, it makes me feel good to be a Gotham Cityite when I see how everybody forgave Chief Chicken. You'll find that people are basically good. They're merely reacting to their surroundings. Chief Screaming Chicken was wooed from the path of righteousness by some extravagant promises. It's a human failing that all of us are subject to at one time or another. But all that's water over the embankment. - Right now our job is to find Egghead. -Mm. Any ideas? We know his diet consists solely of grade triple-A white eggs. If he were to take a trip, which all the evidence indicates he might do he would first have to load up on all the eggs he could carry. Right. How many poultry farms, triple-A variety, are there within the limits of Gotham City? Mm, three. Bernie's Chicken Farm in the Lakewood area. But that farm produces only brown eggs. Hmm. Paul's Poultry Palace in Pimlico. - And if my memory serves me correctly-- -As it always does. --Paul's Poultry Palace has only eight hens and one rooster. Scarcely enough to feed his voracious appetite. And with all the roads out of Gotham City blocked that leaves only one place. Are you some kind of nut or something? You can't come in here and steal my eggs like this, bub. Mr. MacDonald, you should be egg-xpressing your thanks that I saw fit to grace your ranch with my presence. Ha, ha. Only the finest quality eggs will do for my dietary practices. Besides, your prices are egg-xorbitant. I'll make you a good deal. Better than wholesale. My good fellow, let me egg-xplain. Egghead never pays for anything. It's just not done among your finer class of criminals. Why, do you realize that if I paid one penny, it would ruin my reputation among my peers? - It's almost dark, Egghead. - Don't you think we better get going? Hey, how are we gonna get out of here? They blocked off the airports. - And the roads. -And the harbor. Well, since all of the overland routes have been egg-xpunged the only way to go is underground. So let us explore Gotham City's sewer system. - Just the right place for a rat like you. -The only place you're going is up the river. Let's give them a taste of our knuckles, shall we? Batman! Batman! All right, all right, that's all. Cease and desist. I'm done. Who's gonna pay for all my eggs? You'll be reimbursed, Mr. MacDonald, at the current market rate. Woe is me. My criminal career is now egg-xtinct. Foolish evil man. You're going to end up where all broken eggshells end up. In the garbage. Give me a break, Batman? You'll be dealt with fairly in a court of law. Miss Bacon. I'm puzzled why a girl of your obvious breeding, education, style and class should have become involved with someone like Egghead. I guess I'm just lucky, Batman. Is this the end of the book, Eggy-pooh? The end, period. I guess I laid an egg. Batman, we owe you a debt that can never be repaid. Good city government is its own reward, Commissioner Gordon. All the visiting criminals have been apprehended by our stalwart police, Boy Wonder. The police of Gotham City are the best anywhere. Our job is done. Come on, Robin. If you need us again, gentlemen, we're as close as your Batphone.

NARRATOR". We have already seen the great maestro of the keyboard, Chandell. Attacked by phantoms at Wayne Manor. Catastrophe. Batman on vacation, out of touch. Chandell demand protection. Tricky Chandell, who was also the criminal fingers. Blackmailed into a life of crime by twin brother Harry. Police precautions at a concert. In vain, Chandell struck by a remote piano control. But wait, way off in the wilderness, Bruce Wayne hears a false note. A call to Dick Grayson. Chandell in hot pursuit. Why, what could he be up to? A false attack. A devilish clue. Into a trap. The Dynamic Duo about to be perforated into human piano rolls. Disaster. Which way out? The most dreadful music is yet to come in just one minute. Holy metronome, what a fate. Punched into player piano rolls. True, Robin, scarcely an end I'd ever anticipated. Life, a cupful of surprises to the last drop. - See any way out, Batman? -Frankly, from this perspective, no. - Wait a minute. -A minute's too long. My toes are almost in the puncher. Robin, with every ounce of breath that's left in you sing along with me. Sing what? Don t ask questions, Robin. Sing each note precisely as I do. When I sing, you sing. Ready, Robin? Sing. Will that terrible sound never stop? Death squeals of a brace of bats. Nice singing, Robin. It saved our lives. Holy Caruso, how? Observe how this machine works. Music from the master piano is picked up by this microphone and transmitted to the perforating cylinders which reproduce the chords perfectly. We outshouted the piano, don't you see? How come we didn't get punched full of holes? Because of the notes I selected. They were calculated to make the punches fall precisely around the outlines of our bodies. I visualized the chords in my mind. Holy perfect pitch. Yes, it's useful sometimes. However, no time for self-congratulation. - Let's burst in and bag those birds. -Roger. Poor bats, they squeak no more. Truly spoken you vile criminal twin. Girls, run for your lives. - I'll round up those crooked cookies. - No, Robin, wait. Batman to police. There's a knocked-out criminal at 20-B Front Street. Zip code 9999979. Come, pick him up. Batman out. Holy fugitives, you mean we're gonna let those girls go? Yes, Robin, as part of a plan. The infamy of it, attacking your own brother, the great artist Chandell, with a root beer bottle. - What's behind all this? -I don't know. All right, canary, start talking. It's somebody called Fingers. - Fingers? -Yeah, he's behind it all. He's got a plot to get his mitts on the entire fortune of millionaire Bruce Wayne. Okay, pal, button up. My name is Alfred Slye, sir. I'm a noted criminal attorney. Very incautious of you to begin this interrogation without my presence, wasn't it? Chief. A most unwelcome arrival. The fellow was beginning to talk. - Want me to toss the mouthpiece out? -Heaven forbid, Chief O'Hara. In today's climate, that could land us behind bars. Then what'll we do? Patience and subtlety, the honest policeman's only aids. Turn up the lights a notch. No law against making this villain sweat. Excuse us, it was a trifle dark in here. Here you are, pal. - That's too much. -indeed. Talk about crude, naked police brutality. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Are you gonna charge my client or aren't you? I hereby charge him with a felonious attempt to perforate the Dynamic Duo into player piano music rolls, -Ha, ha. Very amusing. Where are your witnesses? - Witnesses? -I order a countercharge, sir. I accuse Batman and Robin of malicious mischief. To wit, the damage of a licensed perforating machine by introducing foreign objects into same. Said objects being themselves. Saints alive. The world's gone mad, the whole planet lunatic. Come along, Harry. You don't have to listen to this raving. A new super-criminal with a plan for getting the entire Wayne fortune. To put it pithily, this Fingers fits like a glove. Fits what, Batman? The musical theme that's run through this entire affair. Holy greed, how could a crook hope to get ahold of the Wayne fortune? A good question, Robin, pursue it. It's impossible, Batman, your assets are tied up by a hundred ironclad trusts. Precisely. At the risk of alarming you, I can see only one What would happen to Bruce Wayne's fortune if he suffered a fatal accident? Gosh, I guess I, Dick Grayson, would inherit it. Right again. And if Dick's life were snuffed out in that same accident? It would all go to Aunt Harriet. Um, excuse me, sir. Will you be wishing my services for the next few hours? Not that I know about, Alfred, why? Mrs. Cooper has requested me to drive her into the city, sir. It appears she has another, um, ahem, secret rendezvous with the Maestro Chandell in his dressing room, sir atop the Gotham City Town Hall. Good day, sir. Holy Bluebeard. You mean Fingers and Chandell are the same guy? I fear it's a dreadful probability. He's gonna bump us off in our guise of Bruce and Dick then vamp Aunt Harriet, marry the Wayne fortune. A clever and diabolical scheme. This Chandell is a deucedly attractive fellow. He could pull it off. Gosh, Batman. How could a man like Chandell, the world's greatest pianist take up a life of murderous crime? I think I've guessed that too, Robin. Close your eyes. Summon up every ounce of your super-keen musical memory. Okay, Batman, my eyes are shut, I'm summoning. Remember that concert Chandell gave at the White House some time ago? We listened to it together, you recall? Sure, that was the concert which made him famous. I remember every note. Excellent. Concentrate on the andante passage in his first selection about the 12th bar from the top of page 17 of the score. I'm with you. Page 17. Listen to it. Savor the maestro's interpretation. Oh, beautiful. Such feeling. And I recall, he-- Holy Paderewski. Good boy, Robin. You've caught it. It was exactly the same as the Paderewski version. So exactly that I can draw only one conclusion. He used a player piano at that concert with the music roll cut by Paderewski himself. Precisely. A roll undoubtedly secured from twin brother Harry's music roll factory. To the Batmobile. Come let us stroll down lover's lane And let me kiss you once again Soon we must say: "Auf wiedersehen Auf Wiedersehen, my dear" I know my heart won't beat again Until the day we meet again Sweetheart, goodbye Auf wiedersehen Auf wiedersehen, my dear The softness of these hands are made mindful of a night moth's wings. Oh, you're simply a poet, maestro. Like a night moth's wings, they're dusted. Dusted with the stuff that dreams are made of. Oh, Chandell. Oh, Chandell. The masher, I'll fix him. Hold it, old chum. We mustn't give ourselves away. Self-control is sure tough sometimes, Batman. All virtues are, old chum. Indeed, that's why they're virtues. However, all philosophy aside it looks like Chandell has Aunt Harriet quite thoroughly in his fingers so to speak which isn't a bad thing, Robin. It sets the stage for our next startling move. - What, Batman? -Back to Wayne Manor to that photographic darkroom we built in the hall closet. I have a little plan of my own. Good heavens. Mr. Bruce? Master Dick? Fantastic. I couldn't have arranged it any better myself. Are you going to marry her, Chandell, darling? Of course, I'll marry her. Then I'll sneak 5 million out of our joint checking account and pay off my blackmailing brother, Harry. Imagine, farewell, Chandell. I'll cast off my criminal skin like a molting butterfly. Hold the phone, butterfly. After you marry that rich old dame, where does that leave us? We've slaved for you, Chandell. We've given you the best years of our criminal lives. Dear Doe ravishing Rae marvelous Mimi you don't dream I'd cast you off, I hope. I have plans for you. I'll bet you do. Oh, my ears. Hey, kiddies. What's going on here? That genius twin brother of yours, I had to cool him, Harry. Take our word, he's planning to go straight. And double-cross us all. Wouldn't surprise me a bit. He never was much good. Mr. Slye? Yes, amigo? A legal question. Say this Cooper dame does marry this boob how long before the will is settled and he gets the dough? Considering the crowded state of our courts I'd say about 11 years. -Eleven years? With the Dynamic Duo on our tails, we'll be lucky if we last 11 hours. Which reminds me, Harry, my bill for springing you from the hoosegow. A hundred thousand bucks, payable by midnight tonight or else ethics demand that I turn you back in. You're a charming fellow, Mr. Slye. I'm a criminal attorney. It says so on my letterhead. Music, dreamboat. No, no, please! Dig out that costume of my twin brother's the one he wore at Queen Elizabeth's coronation. I've just thought of a beautiful new plan. When that awful explosion happened, they were-- They were enlarging a photograph of me. Sweet Harriet, please, don't engulf yourself in foolish guilt. Control yourself, listen to me. I have a proposal to make. A proposal? Holy heartbreak, how can he at a time like this? I propose to perform a memorial concert at Gotham Town Hall tonight. Strange. Hardly the proposal I expected. Oh, maestro, how generous of you. Do me a great honor, appear with me on-stage and sing some sweet song in your incomparable voice. Oh, yes. I know just the thing. Wonderful, dear Harriet. Drop by my dressing room at 7 and we'll rehearse a bit. Until tonight at 7. Farewell, adieu. Alfred! Oh, Alfred. You called, madam? Alfred, will you please bring me a tiny glass of blackberry brandy? Begging your pardon, madam, but this unprecedented request for strong spirits is something amiss? It not amiss, Alfred, it's a nightmare. That man who was just here is an imposter. - He was not Chandell. -Oh, dear me. How bizarre. - Are you certain, madam? -Oh, yes, Alfred, I'm quite certain. When a man whom I know as well as I know Chandell gives my hand a kiss Well, Alfred, there's an old saying: "A girl can tell. " I know that life's the secret of it all All the longing, working, waiting Burning, turn Oh, dear. Mercy me, I'm an old fool, aren't I? Oh, don't say it, dear lady. It's your hat brim. It obscures the sheet music. Perhaps if you removed your chapeau. That's a good idea. As they say in the movies, "Stick up your mitts. " Come on, out. You're not the great Chandell. You must be that awful twin brother I read about in the papers. Your name is Harry, is it not? Your cleverness outdoes itself, sweet lady. Don't you "sweet lady" me, you common crook. What's the plot? Were you going to marry me for my money? I'll admit that was one notion, but it's been revised however. The current plot is to lure you here and hold you for a gigantic ransom. Oh, fiddlesticks, who'd pay a gigantic ransom for me? The trustees of the Wayne Foundation, naturally. As sole heiress to millionaire Bruce Wayne's vast fortune you have to sign the papers or they can't spend a nickel. What stupid, ugly greed. I'm delivering you to the police. Start moving. Moving, at a time like this, when my scheme is working so perfectly? Look around you, sweet fool. Oh, sham. You think I'd fall for that old chestnut? Sleep tight, won't you? Quick, the chauffeur's outside. - Blow him a lullaby. -Right, Harry doll. Harry to piano movers. Get over here and put the old lady and her chauffeur in the trunk. Set up to the docks and stand back. Too bad. She was a sweet old lady in her way. Not just sweet, Harry. One of the bravest women ever born. We've been tracking you via a secret radio placed in Mrs. Cooper's handbag. We rescued her and the chauffeur on the sidewalk. Now, it's lucky for us that we brought our bulletproof Bat Shield but it is time to end this criminal symphony. Poor deluded females. And you, you nasty old man have a whiff of Bat-gas. Gosh, Batman, maybe we don't know how to turn this murderous machine off. It is a thought, Robin. It's not much more than they deserve. Is there anything lower than a lawyer who mocks the law? Or an artist who takes up crime? I'm afraid there is. A sworn crime-fighter who tries to take justice in his own hands. With my profoundest admiration, Mrs. Cooper a Citizen's Special Anti-Crime Award. Oh. Heh. A person just does what he has to do and that's what makes America great, isn't it? If only there were more like her. That's enough about silly me. Where is Mr. Chandell? A note for you, madam. The maestro asked me to deliver it to you. Oh. "Dear sweet Harriet. It's better this way. I'm not worthy of you. I must leave this morning on a long, long tour. Good bye. Your Chandell. " A long, long tour? With the usual time off for good, uh, performance I expect it will last about three years. Oh, if I had the wings like an angel Over these prison walls I would fly And I'd fly to the arms Of my poor darlin' And there I'd be willing to die Listen, you bulls, I'm busting out of here, see? And ain't nobody gonna stop me. NARRATOR". Next week the Penguin waddles again. 
NARRATOR". In Gotham City, when the social set goes diamond shopping there is only one place to go. And that place is Harry Hummert's. A veritable treasure house among the jewelers catering to the Gotham City elite. Oh, what an exquisite clock, Harry. I didn't see this when I was here last week. Oh, actually Mrs. Frontenac, I only acquired it yesterday. It's a shop piece, not for sale. - Oh. -You wanted to see something in a set of diamond clips, didn't you? -Oh, yes. Yes, I'd love that. Perhaps one of these would please you, Mrs. Frontenac. Hmm. Hummert would be astonished if he knew that the lens of a transistorized TV camera unit is hidden in that antique clock. -Oh. Control calling Second Hand. Number 3 to Control. Reading you. The time is at hand. Get ready to strike in 10 seconds. We're wound up and ready, Control. Stand by, Second Hand. That's odd. Shouldn't be striking the hour now. There must be something wrong with the mechanism. Such adorable cherubs. Hummert's? Robbed? Broad daylight? Commissioner, did you hear the news? Yes, Chief O'Hara. And ominous news, I'd say. The knockout gas the criminals used came from an antique clock. Then it's himself, that conniving crook who uses time for crime, the Clock King. I fear we're in over our heads, Chief O'Hara. I'll contact the Caped Crusaders at once. One moment, commissioner. I shall expedite his presence. I don't pay enough attention to the two of you. Oh, you do. You do. Just run along and enjoy yourself, Aunt Harriet. We'll be fine. Ha, ha. Hmm. - Check. -Oh! - The Batphone, sir. -Hmm? - The Batphone. -Oh. That was perfect timing. I quite agree. From what you say about the robbery at Hummert's it clearly indicates the modus operandi of Clock King. Clock King? Apparently, Dick. But this time, we'll bypass police headquarters. What? When one is dealing with a villain like Clock King, one must use time wisely. We'll go directly to Hummert's gem shop and try to pick up the lead from there. To the Batpoles. Excellent. Every move right on schedule. Just look at all these goodies. You're marvelous, Clock King. That, my dear, is because I plan every move like a timetable. As my archenemies, Batman and Robin, will soon find out to their detriment. Thinking. Every minute, every second. Thinking. Men. You've done well. I'm proud of you. Thanks, Your Highness. Ah. I see it is almost the hour. Zero minus seven, six, five Here it comes again. Three, two, one, zero. Lovely. Lovely. What an exquisite, exciting rhapsody of sound. Millie, back to your dusting. Second Hands we have work to do. That's all I know about it, Batman. I bought the clock at the Parkhurst Galleries. I go there nearly every week. Every Wednesday, as a matter of fact. Benson Parkhurst is an old friend of mine. Obviously, Clock King learned that it was Mr. Hummert's habit to go to that particular auction gallery. And he had the clock put up for sale knowing he'd be sure to bid on it. Thank you, Mr. Hummert. Come, Robin. Let's pay a visit to the Parkhurst Gallery. Men. And Millie. According to my crime table our next target will be the Parkhurst Art Gallery. Gee. After which, we will strike at the home of one of Gotham City's wealthiest young socialites. No kidding, Your Highness. A triple hit in a day? Another of my clever little clocks was bought by a dear old lady who lives in the home of a millionaire. Then, after that pair of jobs I have a real coup in store. In fact, it may well be the biggest clock crime of my distinguished career. Biggest, Clock King? Your Highness, please don't hate me for mentioning them but what about Batman and Robin? Batman and Robin. The nights I've lain awake, scheming, plotting my revenge against those flat-foot prints in the sands of time. Those shadows on the sundial of true criminal genius. However, if Batman and the Boy Blunder, ha, ha "Blunder. " If they should attempt to cross my plans they'll find they're just in time to count their final seconds. And when they do, I'll strike hard. I'd be glad to help you in anyway, Batman. Things are little hectic here today. We're getting ready upstairs for our first Pop Art show. We'll try not to detain you, Mr. Parkhurst. Do you recall the man who brought the clock here to be auctioned? The one Mr. Hummert bought. I'll have to consult the auction book for that day. Now, let me see. Oh, yes. Here it is. Now I remember him. He was a heavyset man with a small beard and, urn, his name was Mr. Chronos. Chronos? - The Greek word for "time. " -Correct, Robin. Thanks to your diligence in foreign languages we can now safely assume that the mysterious Mr. Chronos is actually Clock King in disguise. Amazing. The way you two figured that out. I could have never done it. Don't feel bad, Mr. Parkhurst. You haven't been trained in deduction as we have. Come, Robin, we must be going. We must find something that will give us a clue as to where our evil enemy, Clock King, will strike next. I think I have an idea where we might find that lead. - Where, Batman? -Dunbar's Drive-In. Good afternoon, Gotham City viewers. This is your roving TV reporter, Fred Forbes welcoming you to the What's New in Art? segment of our Gotham City report. Coming to you today from the famous Parkhurst Galleries. For years, the Parkhurst Galleries have been known for their exhibitions and auctions of art that have stood the test of time. But now, Mr. Benson Parkhurst, the owner of the galleries, has bowed to the inevitable and the galleries are having their first exhibit of Pop Art. And it seems to be a hit. - Out of the way. Make way, please. -Something that's not on the program. - This way. Careful. Gently, gently. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is going on here? What's going on here, my dear sir is certainly not an exhibition of true Pop Art. This way. Out. Forward. Ah. Inferior. All definitely inferior. - And just who are you, sir? -Heh. I am Progress Pigment, the king of Pop Art and apostle of its culture. A little more to the left, boys. Now, I will let you have the honor of viewing my latest masterpiece. Off. I call it Time Out Of Joint. - What--? -What is this? This is certainly an incredible machine. - It is really a work of art. -Get this junk out of here. Junk? Do you realize what this is? You are looking at the symbolization of time. Time, the ever-moving balance wheel of the universe. Observe. Everything will be all right. Please, don't go. Yeah, wait. It'll be all right. Hey, it's the Batmobile. - Just look. -I am looking. And isn't Robin too much? At the risk of sounding naive, Batman how do you expect to find a lead to Clock King in this drive-in? At one point, in his sordid criminal career he had a feminine accomplice named Thelma Timepiece. Oh, of course. Welcome to Dunbar's, Batman and Robin. What will it be today? We're looking for someone who might be working here. Thelma Timepiece. Oh, yes. Thelma. Sorry, Batman. You can't win them all. She quit last week. I think she went back to her hometown in the Midwest. But I'd be glad to take your order. I am a little hungry. Of course, Robin. Even crime-fighters must eat. And especially you. You're a growing boy and you need your nutrition. Hamburgers. Medium rare. May I recommend, Batburgers? Batburgers? -"Trouble stealing your appetite?" -"Arrest it with our new Batburger. " I'm honored by this tribute, miss. Two Batburgers, medium rare and two glasses of orangeade. Uh, doubles. Turn on the Bat-scope, Robin. Let's see what's on the Gotham City TV news report. FORBES". There it is, folks. An uninvited entry here at the Parkhurst Galleries. As you can see, the artist Progress Pigment has his contraption working. And the only word to describe it is "wild. " He even has a name for it: Time Out Of Joint. Time Out Of Joint? - Time? Do you suppose--? -If only we could only get a closer look at him. FORBES". We're going to bring Progress Pigment in for a closer look. I want all you folks to see a most unusual artist. Progress Pigment? The beret, the beard, dark glasses. There is a way we could make sure. The Bat-photoscope. Sure. It'll activate the microfilm crime file in the Batcave and transmit a normal photograph of the Clock King to us here. Yes. Ah. How does it look, Robin? Holy masquerade. It's Clock King. - Miss? Would you take our baskets, please? -Oh, sure. Men, the hour is at hand. - It worked. -Naturally. Few people can stand the vibrations of supersonic sound. Now let's get what we came after. That fool, Parkhurst. The sound of this mechanical sculpture covered up the buzz of the saber saw as it was cutting through his stronghold. And right in front of his eyes. Ah. Here it is. My favorite clock masterpiece. And now it's mine, all mine. Come, my good Second Hands. Careful with it. Careful. Careful. Ah. Right on schedule. We've completed another foolproof crime. Let's go. You can only fool some of the people some of the time, Clock King. Batman and Robin. At them, men. I'll give a personal bonus to the first man who knocks out Batman. Four against two. I would say that the odds are in our favor, Robin. Come on. Fight, fight. Go. Wait. This valuable painting might be damaged. Isn't it beautiful? Please, let me put it down so it won't be hurt. Agreed? Agreed. I seem to have hurt my wrist a little bit. Just give me a moment. Anytime you're ready, Clock King. Just give me a minute. A minute to touch my counterattack activator. Holy mainspring. I can't move. Perhaps I should've titled my creation: The Dynamic Duo: Caught in the Coils of Time. The cops. That'll be Chief O'Hara. I contacted him with the mobile Batphone on the way here. I'll have you free in a jiffy, Robin. Batman. Dynamic Duo, are you all right? Yes, Chief O'Hara. Only our pride has been hurt. Clock King and his cohorts escaped. Robin. Look. Clock King dropped one of his watches. He must have accidentally dropped it when he massaged his hurt wrist. And it's not the seal type, either. Quickly, Robin, to the Batcave. I want to examine this watch carefully. According to the Bat-chemical Analyzer the dust in Clock King's watch contains aluminum oxide. - Is that important? -indeed it is, Robin. Aluminum oxide is used in the manufacture of synthetic gems. I still don't get it. How does that connect to Clock King? It's obvious, Robin. Synthetic gems are widely used in jeweled watch movements. - Holy sundials. Then you mean-- -Exactly, Robin. Clock King's hideout is-- ls a place where they make synthetic jewels for watches. We'll just feed the necessary data into the Batcomputer. Well, this has to be it, Robin. "Tick Tock Synthetic Rubies incorporated. " According to this card, that firm went out of business four months ago. A wise idea to make a surprise entrance through the rear of the building. Wiser yet, old chum, if we make it up the outside of the building. This should be good practice if something ever takes us to Mount Everest, Batman. I think we'll be confining our campaign against evil to Gotham City for some time to come, old churn. It needs us. Hey, Batman and Robin. - What are you guys doing? -Just routine crime-fighting. Would you like to come in? I'm rehearsing. Thank you, citizen, but our pursuit of justice allows us few diversions. - Be seeing you. -Bye, Robin. Hey, you guys come and catch my act sometime. I dig yours. All right, fellas, one more time. From a whip-or-will Ha, ha. Welcome. I've anticipated your visit. That's why I coated that section of the floor with super slick watch oil. Second Hands. Batman we're inside a giant hourglass. You grinning devils. Looking for your utility belts? They're over here. Naturally, I removed them to prevent your escape. Batman. Sand. It's starting to pour down. Your Highness, your alarm is ringing. I'm well aware of it. Well, Dynamic Duo, we'll have to leave now if we're to keep to our timetable of crime. We certainly don't want to disappoint Mr. Smith, do we? After all, he's going to be of invaluable help to us at exactly 5:00 this afternoon. Some people kill time. But this time, time is going to kill you. 
NARRATOR". Every day in Gotham City brings new surprises but this day is going to top them all. Although it begins none too differently, just wait. Just wait. Well, we've managed to clip Catwoman's claws once again. She won't be troubling Gotham City for a long while. She sure led us a chase, Batman. If I never hear another one of those meows, it'll be too soon. I'm afraid your eardrums aren't going to get much rest or had you forgotten that we invited Chief O'Hara and Commissioner Gordon to the opera tonight? That's right. Batman, maybe I should stay home tonight. Homework, you know? I think you should acquire a taste for opera, Robin, as one does for poetry and olives. Besides, Commissioner Gordon is bringing his daughter, Barbara, along as my date. So? So tonight is Dick Grayson's night for musical appreciation and the social amenities. NARRATOR". While at the Gotham City Library, where one of the newer librarians is leaving for her night of culture and social graces - Good night, Drusilla. See you in the morning. -Good night, Barbara. Gotham City Public Library. Oh, Commissioner Gordon, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you. Yes, she's right here. Just a moment. -It's your father, Barbara. -Hi, Daddy. You haven't forgotten about the opera, have you? How could I? It's The Marriage of Figaro, my very favorite opera. Besides, um, I'm looking forward to seeing our host, millionaire Bruce Wayne. Well, he's gonna get quite a surprise tonight. He hasn't seen you since you went away to college four years ago. And you're twice as pretty now as you were then. Ha, ha. Another one of your unbiased opinions, Daddy. Any good police commissioner must always remain unbiased, Barbara. Ha, ha. Seven, your apartment. Bruce Wayne is meeting us there to pick you up. - I'll be ready. - Bye. Bye. NARRATOR". Later, Barbara Gordon enters the lobby of her midtown apartment house unaware of imminent danger. Welcome to the cage, my wild dove. Hwah, hwah, hwah. - Penguin. -What a tasty little squab she is too. Trust Penguin to have a surefire recipe for pigeon pie. Hwah, hwah, hwah. Barbara. That's odd, Chief O'Hara. Maybe she just stepped out for a minute, commissioner. But she knew we'd be here at 7. And that afternoon paper was delivered hours ago. Why didn't she take it inside? Uh Ha, ha. Our secret. Looks as if she hasn't even been home from work. I don't understand it. Where can she be? NARRATOR". You'd be very surprised to find out, commissioner for your daughter is only 20 feet away from you in the very next apartment. You'll have to admit, this is a stroke of genius, my love. Hiding you out in this vacant apartment right next to your very own. It's the last place in Gotham City anybody would think of looking for you. What's going on there? Gordon and O'Hara just went into the apartment, Pengy. And here comes Bruce Wayne and that witless ward of his. I think it's time for my surprise telephone call. Hello, commissioner, Chief O'Hara. - Where's Barbara? -She's not here. - Not here? -And I'm worried. It's not like her at all. That's probably her calling you right now. I hope you're right, Chief O'Hara. - Hello? -Hello, commissioner. Police Commissioner Gordon? Guess who this is. Hwah, hwah, hwah! Penguin. It's Penguin. Yes, I just called to say hello, commissioner. By the way, you didn't happen to be missing anything lately, did you? Missing? Miss-- Barbara. You've got Barbara, you feathered fiend. Hush, hush, sir. Is that any way to speak to your daughter's guardian? Penguin, if you harm her if you so much as touch one hair on her head I'll-- I'll-- - You'll do what? -I'll-- Let me talk to him, commissioner. This is Bruce Wayne. Oh, the millionaire joyboy. What can I do for you? Penguin, I'll pay whatever price you ask, as long as you do not harm Barbara Gordon. Harm her? Fa! I'm gonna make her the happiest girl in Gotham City. And you might take a look at this evening's Gotham City Times. - The Gotham City Times? -That's right. The society section. Hwah, hwah. What was that about the Gotham City Times? He said something about the society page. Let's see if I can find it. - Oh, no. -What is it, Bruce? What does it say? "The Penguin, well-known entrepreneur and man-about-town announced today his forthcoming marriage to Ms. Barbara Gordon, daughter of police commissioner--" Marriage? What's going on? What does it mean, Bruce? Why, Barbara would never consent to marry that scoundrel. Of course not, commissioner. That's why he kidnapped her. He'll threaten her and he'll force her to consent. - But why? - By marrying your daughter Penguin becomes son-in-law of the commissioner. Exactly, Dick. He hopes to gain immunity from prosecution by becoming a member of the family, as it were. And I think he fully intends to go through with it, commissioner. There is only one man who can help me. Batman? Yes, chief. Batman. I'm afraid you'll have to go without us. Well, we're in no mood for the opera, commissioner. If there's anything I can do, you can telephone me at Wayne Manor. Thank you, Bruce, from the bottom of a father's heart. Yeah, my sweet guinea hen. Soon, you and I will be joined in the holy bonds of matrimony. Really, Penguin, all that waddling around you do must have scrambled your brains. Don't be cocky, my little chicken. If you won't marry me, I'll have to put plan B into operation which is being rehearsed right over there. Show plan B to my little bride-to-be, boys. Penguin, you monster. You wouldn't dare hurt my father. Oh, yes, I would, and I will. Now, you make up your mind. Either you become my bride or you become an orphan. Which is it? - Put plan B into operation. -No. I'll marry you. Just leave my father alone. That's what I like to hear. Obedience. That is the first wifely virtue. Now, a couple of you finks go on out, and put the snatch on a minister. Quick. What kind of minister, Pengy? Any minister, you fink. I wanna get this thing over with before the Dynamic Dunderheads put the snatch on me. Don't worry, boss. We'll get you to the church on time. That's it. Here you are, my love. Now, I'll tell you that in the adjacent bedroom is a lovely wedding gown. I want you to put it on and wear it with radiance like any blushing bride. I am not blushing. - I'm furious! -Ooh. Yes, commissioner. Mm. Yes, I suspected as much. Robin and I knew something was wrong as soon as we saw the evening paper. We'll use the Batcomputer to make a list of all of Penguin's hideouts. We'll telephone as soon as it finishes. We'll get her back, commissioner. Where's Alfred? He can give us a hand with the computations. Unfortunately, Robin, he's out for the evening. He's meeting with his minister to discuss a church supper. I do hope the church supper is a success, Alfred. We badly need the money for our summer camp. - I'm sure it will be, Reverend Hazlitt. -If it is successful the congregation will owe you a great debt of thanks. The only thanks I need is the knowledge that some underprivileged youngsters will have a chance to enjoy a few weeks in the country this summer. All right, which one of you is the minister? - Why do you ask? -Because we're taking him with us, pops. - Are you it'? -Yes. - Wait-- I shall be quite all right, I assure you. Tie that one up. I'll take the preacher back to the hideout. - Move it, preach. -I beg your pardon? I said, move it. Of course. Did you hear something, Robin? It's Alfred's emergency belt-buckle Batcall signal. - He's in trouble. -Holy complications. First Barbara Gordon is kidnapped, now Alfred is in trouble. Yes, it's just possible that the two events are related. But how, Batman? I don't know. Yet. The first thing to do is to locate Alfred. Man the Batradarscope. Roger. - Batradarscope on. -Check. I'll feed Alfred's signal into the Batradarscope. Got it. He's at location B-7642. "B-7642. " Holy complications indeed, Robin. This is one of Penguin's possible hideouts. To the Batmobile. A number one hitch and no slipup. Now, the ravishing bride is in there. Come on, coach her on her lines. If I don't hear a nice "I do" you'll be visiting heaven instead of talking about it. - Miss? -Reverend. There's no time to explain. I must trust in your discretion as a man of the cloth. You mustn't reveal my secret. But I don't know your secret. I don't even know who you are. Not now, Charlie. I'm in a hurry. NARRATOR". What in the world is this? Revolving walls? Hidden rooms? Disguises? What is Barbara Gordon's secret? You are about to witness the coup of the century. The world's leading arch criminal becomes the son-in-law of the police commissioner. I don't know whether to call him "Daddy" or just "commish. " If I were you, Penguin, I'd call help right now. When we get through with you, you'll be hollering "uncle" instead of "Daddy. " Oh, you bungling buttinskies always sticking your nose into my business. This time I'm gonna teach you a lesson. As long as you're holding classes, Penguin, perhaps you'd include Batgirl too. "Batgirl? "Batgirl? "Batgirl? "Batgirl? Bats. I'm surrounded by bats. Never mind. I'll teach you a lesson myself. Go on. Go on. Give it to them! Well, get them over here! I don't know who you are, but you certainly know how to handle yourself well. Holy agility, I'll say. Thank you, Dynamic Duo. I'm sure you could've handled these crooks without my help but I was glad for the chance to join in the fun. I can understand your enjoyment. However, our purpose here is quite serious. Oh, crime fighting is a serious matter to me too, Batman but we might as well get a few laughs out of it. Perhaps some other time. Criminals like Penguin are dangerous and deadly. We'd better see if Barbara Gordon's all right. - Are you all right in there? -Quite, sir. - Who's that? - Alfred. Millionaire Bruce Wayne's butler, sir. We'll have you out as soon as we can Bat-pick this lock, Alfred. Bat-tools, Robin. Of course, we could always borrow a hairpin from Batgi-- She's gone. Shouldn't we go after her? At least find out who she is? Not now, Robin. Let's get back to work on this lock. Yeah. So much for the Masked Meddlers, huh? Now, hurry up. UP- UP- Oh, we must get to our alternate hideout. The fuzz will be all over the place. Come here. Come here. Come here. Over here. I want you to bag those Dim Dynamics there and throw them out the window into the truck. We'll take care of them later. Get out of the way. Get them over here. Let me get these two in here. I got another key. All right. Now, bag that preacher and my prospective bride-to-be, will you? Bring her over here. Hurry up, you clods. Hurry up, will you? Throw them out. Come on, you two, throw them out. Close that bag. That's right. Over here. Get them. Throw them over here. Now, lower yourselves. Lower yourselves. Oh, yeah. Now the groom. All right, take it away! NARRATOR". Now what? Another surprise? A Batgirl Cycle in a secret freight elevator? Here comes the bride, all bagged and tied Well, Dynamic Dupes how does it feel to be a couple of human tea bags? Steaming us to death will do you no good, Penguin. - The law will get you in the end. -I am merely going to dunk you a little. But before I do dunk you, I think I'll let my prospective bride out of the bag so she can see what'll happen if she doesn't cooperate. Get out, little cutie pie. Come on-- Oh, it's the preacher. Well, you better watch the dunking too, in case you get any ideas of making trouble. Now my little bride. Oh, excuse me, sir. Hwah! Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Oh, it's into the pot with you, sir right after you've performed my marriage, yeah? Before you throw everyone in the pot, Penguin you may find yourself in hot water. Batgirl. How did you find this place? I just adore weddings, Penguin. Well, funerals before weddings, Batgirl. Get her. - Alfred's really giving it to them. -So is Batgirl. Sorry it took me so long, sir, but I had a little bird trouble on the way. Ha, ha. Hwah, hwah, hwah! You're not a minister at all. I heard you tell Batman you were Bruce Wayne's butler. Yes. I'm afraid that's true, Ms. Gordon-- Uh, Batgirl. You tricked me into revealing my secret by posing as a minister. But I had no intention of tricking you. I only took the Reverend Hazlitt's place because I wanted to protect him from being injured by Penguin's thugs. Well, then I apologize. That was a very brave thing to do, Alfred. But the fact remains, you do know my secret, my dual identity. And you must swear never to reveal it to anyone. - Well, really, Batgirl, I-- -No, Alfred, you must swear. If you reveal my identity to anyone, I'll be of no further use as a crime-fighter. You wouldn't take advantage of a woman's trust, would you? Now, you must swear, as a gentleman's gentleman. Very well. You have my word as a gentleman's gentleman that no one will ever learn your secret from me. Thank you, Alfred. I must make a quick change. It's time to bag the bird, huh, Batman? I think so, Robin. Birds are out of season. Get away. There'll be no bird-bagging here. Get away. Get away. Unhand me, you poacher. Hwah, hwah, hwah. - Where is Barbara Gordon? -I placed her out sight to avoid all danger in the fighting. -Good show, Alfred. What happened, Batman? Is that horrible man gone? He's temporarily out of circulation. Are you all right, Ms. Gordon? Yes, just never been proposed to at umbrellapoint before. You're quite safe now, Ms. Gordon. His umbrellas are closed. Thanks to you, Batman. I'm sorry to be so helpless. Alfred, where's Batgirl? Oh, she left a few minutes ago, sir. She said she had other business to attend to. I expect we haven't seen the last of her. I shouldn't be at all surprised, sir. Who is this Batgirl? That's what we'd all like to know. Whoever she is behind that mask of hers - she helped us out of a dire dilemma. - Oh, yes. Think how horrible it would have been to be married to the Penguin. Hwah, hwah, hwah. Horrible? To be married to me? Fa. You can't imagine such bliss. Fine score on your driving test. How does it feel to have a license? Well, it's gonna be a little easier on Batman now that Robin can drive. Let's, uh, stick to Dick Grayson for a moment. How would you like to, uh, drive this? This? Me? Since you got your license on your birthday, you deserve a little something special. A little something? Gosh, Bruce, this is great. Oh, this is great, Chief O'Hara. A very sizable check from millionaire Bruce Wayne for our police pension fund. Ha, ha! I must call him at once and thank him. - Bonnie? Bonnie--? - Ha, ha. - What--? - Riddle me this. Good heavens, the Riddler. Very good. Now, when is a jet stream like a daffodil? A jet stream like a daffodil? Riddler. Riddler. He's gone. But what--? Bonnie told me we had trouble with cross lines all morning. Then I'd better cross Riddler's line with Batman's, quick. NARRATOR". The Riddler, back to puzzle and perplex the Dynamic Duo? Be sure to watch the next episode. Gosh, Bruce, what's that? It's a Bat-alert Buzzer connected to the phone in the Batcave as in our other cars. Let's go. Remember, this is not the Batmobile. Don't worry, Bruce. Highway safety is every citizen's prime responsibility. 
NARRATOR". We have already seen a beauty queen kidnapped. And an indoor blizzard. Only one man could keep a cool that cool. While the Dynamic Duo dynamite a door. The iceman cometh with a delivery of what? Green ice? Bribe money? Anyway, that's what the papers seem to feel. But Bruce Wayne still had the social responsibilities of any average millionaire. Though there was a surprise guest at his garden reception. Several surprising guests, in fact. And a freezing finale to the affair. So back to the capes and cowls. And a stop at the Frosty Freezies Factory where Robin tangled with a freeze gun. And the Dynamic Duo found themselves with a choice of very frosty flavors. Fooled, framed and frozen. Frosty Freezies instead of crime-fighters. What now? What next? We have been in some pretty tight fixes, but I don't see how we're gonna get out of this one. Yes, this is quite a predicament, old chum. But remember, in the end, right always triumphs. If it does, I'm going to spend the rest of my life in a Turkish bath. A Turkish bath. You've hit it, Robin. The steam in the pipes of most Turkish baths is superheated moisture. Remove the heat, and the moisture turns to frost. Do you feel anything around your feet? Yeah, chilblains. No, no, something mechanical. Some kind of valve or a blower. Something that might inject the flavoring or the coloring or the freezing components. I don't know, Batman. I think there's a little spigot or something. In mine too. It might be the heat exhaust valve. If we can just get our feet to do the work for our fingers and recycle the exhaust in the heating unit of the containers we might reverse the process of refrigeration and the heat transfer will melt our way out. Too bad, too bad. Perhaps I shouldn't have disposed of Batman and Robin. At least not so soon. Then I could have toyed with them a little longer and destroyed their saintly image slower but more effective. I have an idea. Chill, go and get me the instant camera. After I'm through with this little business, I'm going to execute my plan for the greatest ice crime in history that will destroy all of Gotham City in a few minutes. And there will be no Batman and Robin to stop me. And then, my darling, Miss Iceland your temperature will be down to my temperature and you will become Mrs. Freeze. Never. Not if I live to be a hundred below zero. I'll never marry you. Stubborn but beautiful. This plan is going to be something really wild, boys. Wild. NARRATOR". That wild plan better include Batman and Robin for even now a well thawed-out Dynamic Duo race to the Batcave to plot their next move. An obvious hoax. Doctoring up the picture by superimposing his watch on my wrist. Holy distortion. Most unsporting of Mr. Freeze, I must say. Yeah, sure makes you look bad, Batman. Although the newspaper clearly indicated that this photograph came from an anonymous source and that quite possibly it might be a fake the great majority of the people will only look at the photograph and not read the text. An unfortunate failing of the masses, sir. What do we do now? The only thing we can do, Robin. Hang up our capes and cowls. Oh, no, sir, not that. I'm afraid so, Alfred. With all this adverse publicity it might be well to let the people think what they will that we've taken a runout powder. That way, maybe we can lull Mr. Freeze into a false sense of security make him overplay his hand. After all, I'm sure he believes that we're Frosty Freezies by now. You were most ingenious in preventing that, sir. Thank you, Alfred. But it will take more ingenuity to get us back in the good graces of the good people of Gotham City. Aunt Harriet asked us to go into the city on an errand as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, remember'? Mm. Nellie, gentlemen, please, please, one at a time. Are you going to prefer bribery charges against them or is the Dynamic Duo exempt from the law? Nellie, I resent that innuendo. Nobody is exempt from the law. Batman would be the first to say so if he were here. But he isn't, commissioner nor has he shown his masked face around Gotham City since that grandstand play at Wayne Manor. Now, I'm sorry, I simply don't have any more time. Chief. No, you don't have time. At least not wristwatch time. Maybe you'd better ask Batman the time of day. -Isn't he the one wearing your watch? -All right. Nellie, and the rest of you back to your typewriters to peck out more of your slanted stories. Mother Machree. But it's a sad state of affairs in Gotham City when journalism stoops so low. Too bad. The truth really hit a nerve root, hasn't it? Out. What do you think, commissioner? I honestly don't know what to think, Chief O'Hara. But I do fear for Batman's heroic image. I have a feeling the terrible tide of adverse public opinion may soon engulf our Caped Crusader. Boo, Batman. Gosh, Bruce, did you hear that? Nothing has ever cut me so deeply to the quick. No blow ever struck by any arch-villain has ever hurt me so acutely as that little boy's boo. One billion dollars. One billion dollars, they'll pay me. And nobody can stop it, especially not Batman and Robin, eh? By the way, why don't the newspapers mention anything about their sad end at the Frosty Freezies Factory? Maybe nobody has found them yet. Of course, Chill. And by the time they find them, they'll make Freezies for Goliath. You can't get away with it. There is still the law. Good will triumph. Shh. Don't get excited, darling, Miss Iceland. I don't want your temperature to rise even a few degrees. One billion dollars. The citizens of Gotham City will pay me or I will bury all of them under one huge cake of ice exactly like a million years ago. Wild. Wild. Utterly Wild. Preposterous. Utterly and fantastically preposterous. Mr. Freeze has finally gone too far, demanding $1 billion by threatening to completely cover Gotham City with ice. In August? August or December I wouldn't take Mr. Freeze's threat too lightly, commissioner. With all due respect, Mr. Wayne you don't think that Mr. Freeze could really do such a thing. I mean, I think he would do it if he could, but I don't think he can, can he? - Don't underestimate his power, Chief O'Hara. -Look what he did the other night at the party when he instantly froze us in the pool. But could he freeze a whole metropolis the size of Gotham City? May I see his blackmail note, commissioner? Uh, yeah, surely. "One billion dollars by high noon tomorrow or" Et cetera, et cetera. "And if you do not believe me, try turning on your water faucets at 2:00 this afternoon. " - Two o'clock? -Two o'clock. Beg your pardon, chief, but the switchboard is lit up like a Christmas tree. - Everybody is complaining. -About what, sergeant? The water, sir. Nobody can get any water through their faucet. - Did you check with the water department? -Yes, sir. But if you don't mind me saying so I think they must be nipping a bit over there at the waterworks. - Do you know what they said? - The hottest day of the year and they said the water reservoir in Gotham City Park is frozen solid which it never has been before, even on the coldest day of the year. The newsmen learned of the diabolical scheme of Mr. Freeze to completely cover Gotham City with ice unless $1 billion is paid to him before high noon tomorrow. Since the announcement less than two hours ago panic has hit the streets. Motorists have jammed the highways leading out of Gotham City. Traffic through the Gotham City Tunnel is blocked for three miles. This afternoon, everything is complete chaos. Terror reigns-- With $1 billion, I'm going to go to Switzerland. And I will take you, darling, Miss Iceland, with me as my bride. I wouldn't marry you for $10 billion. You wouldn't? No wonder you haven't changed your mind. This thing is not working as well as it should. I'll tell you What I'll do. In the morning I will freeze your beautiful body solid. Oh! You diabolical beast. Wild. Panic is rampant throughout the long and terrible night. Reports have come in of hysterical children everywhere. Awakening and screaming: "Mama, Mama, Mama, don't let the ice cover me, please. " We've been up all night listening to this. Aunt Harriet, surely you and Alfred need some sleep. Of course, Bruce, we all do. I think Dick and I will take a little walk get some of the frozen cobwebs out of our brain. - Good idea, Bruce. -Let's go, Dick. Poor Bruce. That horrible Mr. Freeze's threats have upset him greatly. Heaven knows what will happen today. Why don't you go up to your room, madam? Thank you, Alfred. Another blazing day in Gotham City with our citizens knowing only too well that by noon they may be freezing to death in subzero temperatures unless, of course, city officials can raise-- Why turn them off? I know the end of that sentence by heart. "One billion dollars. " But it's impossible. Even if we were to mortgage every public building, every city-owned utility we couldn't get a loan for that amount of money in such a short space of time. Do you suppose there's a possibility Mr. Freeze could be bluffing? Well, what would he hope to gain by burying Gotham City under all that ice? Bluffing, never. As for what he could gain, revenge. Revenge for being forced to live away from society. Alone in his own torturous world of subzero temperature. What can we do, commissioner? Do? I honestly don't know, Mayor Linseed. If only Go ahead, commissioner. Call Batman and Robin. If Gotham City ever needed them, she needs them now. I never thought it would happen. But like so many others, l I'm afraid I've lost faith. Atomic batteries to power. - Turbines to speed. -Roger. Ready to move out. Why the change of heart, Batman? Tarnished reputations are unfortunate, Robin. We can live with those. However, a threat to all of Gotham City is something else. He's in that cold storage plant. He and his stooges made an appearance at the Frosty Freezies Factory around the corner. - Then we go? -We go. This should put a crank in his channel. What's the matter? First the commentator said the stock market went kaput and now the TV set went kaput. - Must be the antenna went on the blink. -Frosty, go and fix it. How else would I know whether I get the billion dollars or I have to destroy Gotham City? That should straighten your antennae. Mr. Freeze, I believe. Batman. But you were supposed to be a famous Frosty Freezie by now. Exactly what we wanted you to believe. - Robin. - Wait. Look there. Batman. Why, you beast. You sinful beast. You're inhuman. An absolute demon. Inhuman? Demon? Wild. Why don't you join me in my frozen frigid world? Perhaps you would like to be our best icemen at the wedding. You and Robin. Boys. Wild. Simply Wild. Holy chicken coop. And a nice cold chicken coop, Boy Wonder. I've just one telephone call to make and then I'll finish you off forever. It was a good idea of yours to wear our Bat-thermal underwear. I think your idea is the one that will save us, Robin. Commissioner Gordon speaking. This is Mr. Freeze speaking. It's he. Are you listening? Yes, we're listening. What's your proposition? You know my proposition. One billion dollars by noon or you'll freeze to death. Simple. Mr. Freeze, hear me out. We can't raise $1 billion in such a short time, do you understand? We can't get that much money by noon. You have exactly 26 minutes, that's all. Mr. Freeze, give us more time. We need more time. Time for what? To wait for Batman perhaps? If you are waiting for the Dynamic Duo, forget it. They're my prisoners here in my hideout. And soon they'll be icemen. Real icemen. One billion dollars in 26 minutes. Gentlemen, I'm afraid all is lost. Well, gentlemen, the expression is, I believe: "Time for the kill. Curtains for the Caped Crusaders. " What happened? You're supposed to be frozen. We took the precaution of processing our crime-fighting costumes with a special Bat-Anti-Freeze-Activating solution. And rubbed some on the rest of our bodies. And so it's curtains for you, Mr. Freeze, not for us. Not as long as you're in that cage. We brought along another small surprise. We anticipated trouble here. And came prepared. So you have no chance of outwitting us and even less of glaciating Gotham City. -Is that so? No. That should chill their goose for a while. Now to get that young lady out of her ice coffin. - How? -By a simple method which has become somewhat old-fashioned: an ice pick. Oh, Batman, what can I ever do to thank you? Thank the judges of the Miss Galaxy Beauty Contest, Miss Iceland. They agreed to postpone the final event until you were found. How wonderful. - I'm dying. - Mr. Freeze. Go warm yourself. My My freeze collar. - I'm dying. -Help me, Robin. I'm dying. My freeze collar. I am dying. I'm dying- This should keep you alive, Mr. Freeze, until the police find your ice neckpiece. Well, that's right, Warden Crichton. You see, Mr. Freeze is not a normal average prisoner. He must, at all times, wear his Jet-freeze collar in order to stay alive. Anything you can do to lower the temperature of his cell would be a help. Thank you. Goodbye. Your consideration is admirable, Batman, but Mr. Freeze hardly deserves it. Hmph. Not that icy-hearted enemy of the people. A brother's sufferings claim a brother's pity, gentlemen. - Holy epigrams. -No, Robin. Truisms. No man is really all bad. Now, gentlemen, I suggest we take a break. We have tickets for tonight's finals in the Gotham City Miss Galaxy Contest. Robin is a little young for this sort of thing but-- I'm not gonna be young all my life, Batman, and besides, uh beauty contests are practically an American institution. You see, gentlemen, such pure logic is indisputable. Hello there, young man. I know you were up here, Batman. I saw the Batmobile downstairs. Let's take an elevator ride. Gee, Batman, you're the greatest. False pride is indeed a dangerous thing, Chief O'Hara. False pride? We were talking about beauty contests. I'm talking about myself. How hard it is to admit when I'm wrong. But I was wrong so wrong when I ever even imagined I was losing my faith in Batman. NARRATOR". Next week, rematch. Batman versus the Joker. 
NARRATOR". High noon in Gotham City on a day when the number 12 is to become an evil omen for all good citizens. Very good, Chief O'Hara. Impressive. Part of our new scientific crime-fighting program, commissioner. It shows every art treasure in Gotham City so we can check them out at a moment's notice. With this map and improved criminal procedures we should be well on our way to putting Gotham City's criminals behind bars. Never mind the bars, look to the stars. Not to mention Venus and Mars. Ha-ha-ha! Mother McGinty, it's Joker. In police headquarters? The nerve. Naughty, naughty, commissioner. Let's keep your blue-coated buffoons outside. What do you want here, Joker? Just passing the time. As I did all those months in prison after those caped cabbageheads were lucky enough to apprehend me. Luck had nothing to do with it, Joker. Your warped criminal mind is no match for the wits of Batman and Robin. They'll outsmart you every time. A stroke of luck, I tell you. Agh. Well, in any event, I used my free time to cultivate a new hobby. Astrology, the science of the stars the science of the future. Ha-ha-ha. Woo! Ha-ha-ha! Mustn't touch, chief. Oh, ho. My, what slow learners. Well, what have we here? This should go well with my star charts. Now, enough of this foolery. I've come to announce a new crime wave for Gotham City. This is the first of the zodiac crimes. Look for 11 more, and don't forget to keep score. Venus, my dear. Keep the stars out of your eyes, gentlemen. Woo, ha-ha-ha! Going up, please. Mother McGee, he's gone. The nerve of the scoundrel. I think it's very nice you decided to try out for the school band, Dick. Don't you think so, Bruce? Yes, Aunt Harriet. Very nice. The Batphone, sir. - What's that, Alfred? -it's the Bat-- That phone, sir. I suggest you take it in the study. I think maybe I'll practice my marching, Aunt Harriet. - Yes, commissioner. -I have bad news for you, Batman. That master of maudlin mockery is back. He just barged smack into this office. We'll be right there. The Joker again. To the Batpoles. Gosh, Bruce, it's like trying to get away from an octopus. There it floated, in front of me nose. Dancing back and forth. I can imagine it looked quite mysterious, Chief O'Hara but the principle behind the mechanism is really quite simple. By magnetizing a steel rod and using the polarity of the steel girders in this building Joker could have balanced the rod in midair by using a simple rheostat. But what did he mean by all that talk about the stars? And the wave of 12 crimes he promised. And why steal our official rare art map? He may be planning a crime for each sign of the zodiac. Holy astronomy. Aries, the Ram. Taurus, the Bull. Gemini, the Twins. Virgo, the Virgin. Libra, the Scales. Scorpio, the Scorpion, et cetera, et cetera ad infinitum. Ha. Just as I thought. A cleverly concealed two-way spy device. You mean the Joker could be listening to us at this moment? JOKER". Exactly, Boy Blunder. Ha, ha. - That's him. - Speaking through my spy device which Batman detected as I expected. Ha-ha-ha! But I warn you, Batman, I don't feel rejected with a fortune in treasure still unprotected. However did you know the gadget was here, Batman? Simple matter of deduction, Chief O'Hara. Joker would never come to this office simply to steal a rare art map. Rare art map. R-A-M . Aries, the Ram, the first sign. Gosh, Batman, you think he's already started? Whenever Joker's involved who knows when he started or what he started. The caped crusaders don't know what's in store for them. At long last, I'll have them out of my way permanently. That's a long time, Joker. The proceeds from my zodiac crimes will give me what I've always wanted. Complete control of Gotham City. Oh, yes. The caped crusaders are now solidly star-crossed. Venus. Venus, will you stop bouncing? Your orders, Joker. A larcenous mind in a limber body. - We must stay trim. -No. Batman's no fool. He's no match for me with the stars as my guide. Oh, get the door, Mercury. Freight shipment. Collect. - Two thousand four hundred fifty dollars. -What? Just pay him, Mercury. Quick, give me a hand with this. Ha-ha-ha! Careful now. Careful. What's inside, Joker? Two thousand dollars is a lot of money. Oh, this merchandise is worth $2000. It's worth 200,000, you cheapskate. At least you could have sent me a plane ticket. We had to get you into Gotham City without anyone knowing about it, Pengy. Especially Batman. You better have something good cooked up for that caped creep. Oh, don't you worry, Pengy. The pot's being put on the fire right now, and Batman's in it. Oh, you are a man after my own heart, Joker. - Black, eh? -Black as pitch. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, the caped crusaders study a copy of the rare art map. There are dozens of places the Joker could strike next. And we're not even sure he'll use the map for his next crime. I have a hunch that's Joker calling for me. - May I, commissioner? -Oh, please. Yeah. - Batman speaking. -A clue, caped curmudgeon. Taurus, the Bull, is next on my show and you'll soon be singing a song of woe. Taurus, the Bull. Do you think it's a trick? I don't think it's a trick, Robin. I don't think it's Taurus either. A song of woe. Gemini. - The Twins? -Of course. Sing a song of woe. - I'm confused, Batman. -Think, Chief O'Hara. Gotham City's current singing sensations are two young minstrels called The Twins. Let's go, Robin. NARRATOR". As in Joker's hideout, once more That's delicious. Now, if my calculations are correct-- And my calculations are always correct. Those masked muttonheads may have jumped to the wrong conclusion. Right. Are you sure you can handle this, Pengy? What? Those booted buttinskies are no match for the Penguin. I'll slice them to slivers. I'll pound them to pieces. I'll dice them to driblets. Now, as soon as Pengy jumps in, you cut out, Venus and join me you-know-where. -Right, Joker. Oh, let me at them. I'll fix their hash and I'll grind them into masked meatballs. Undoubtedly the Twins rehearsing for tonight's performance. Perhaps another time might be more appropriate for that, Robin. Oh, sorry. You are The Twins? That's what the sign says, man. How can we smooth your path? We came here to warn you. Someone is after you. Like, we know that, Wonder Boy. We're referring to a criminal threat. Joker. Forget that canary, Batman. You're up against the Black Bird of Prey. Waugh, Waugh! Penguin. There he goes, Robin. After him. We're off. So long, dynamic dunderheads. Enjoy your ride on the Joker's boom bug. Well, now, so these here are them there fabulous Twins. Oh, yes, sir. Named for their identical size, cut and brilliance. And they're only $250,000, for the pair. Aw, get them for me, Daddy, huh? I always did like little purties. Well, now, Bella-Mae Sue, if it is gonna pleasure you, why, sure. Ha, ha. Son, fetch over your guards. I wanna walk these diamonds out of here safe-like. Ha-ha-ha. Of course, sir. Uh, Pinkerton. Burns. These here the only policemen you got on the premises, sugar? Yes. Just these two, but they're picked men. Well, in that there case, I'll just fetch out my money. - May I borrow your comb, Alfred? -Yes, sir. So while Penguin was leading us on a wild-goose chase Joker was stealing the real Twins. I'm afraid so, Robin. But with the help of the Bat-analyst we should be back on Joker's trail. Thanks to Venus' wig. You know, Batman, she seemed like a nice girl in that costume. I suspect she is a nice girl, down deep but she's fallen in with bad companions. And who knows what her home life was like? Now, as soon as the Bat-analyzer determines the components of that wig we can trace it and then-- - We nail Joker. -Aha. Ah. Yes. The wig is 98 percent human hair backed up by the finest silk. There's only one high-fashion shop in Gotham City that has this quality of coiffeur. Harry's Hair Lair. Harry and Bruce Wayne belong to the same golf club. Perhaps Harry can supply the address we need. And then under cover of darkness - Batman. -ls Joker here? Venus how did a nice girl like you get mixed up in an ugly business like this? The Joker says I'm very useful. He says I'm his right-hand girl. Why don't you throw him over? What's he ever done besides get you into trouble? You mean rat on my friends? Criminals have no friends, Venus. Help us get Joker and I'm sure the authorities will take that into account at your trial. No, Batman. I may be felonious, but I'm no fink. I'm pleased to see that you have standards, Venus albeit unlawful ones. However, in this case, your loyalty is misguided. From your reaction, Venus, I would say that is no idle call. - Hello? - Hello? Where's the Joker? Penguin. He stepped out for a few moments. May I take a message? Tell him everything's set for tonight. Would you have any more details? He knows all the details. And tell him I want a 50-50 split. No fast ones. Mm, Waugh. Venus when two arch-criminals like Penguin and Joker combine their criminal talents people are likely to get hurt. Innocent people. Won't you help us, Venus? All right. I'll do it for you, Batman. I don't know what the Joker plans, but I do know where. And I'll take you there. You who have dreams If you act, they'll come true Joker didn't give you any hint as to what he planned? No, Batman. All I know is that he's meeting the Penguin here. If you have a soul and a spirit Stay here. Come on, Robin. - All right, Pengy, let her rip. -Bombs away. Waugh, waugh! Sounds like the Penguin. - Look out, Robin. - You're on target, Pengy. - Hit them again. Woo, hoo, hoo! -Waugh, Waugh, waugh! They crawl and they crawl to the floor And there's nothing in the world All right, tonsils, ransom time. Let's go. Help! I'm being kidnapped! - Police! -Ah, ha-ha-ha! - Let's go, Venus. -No. - Come on, Venus. -No. I said come on. Joker, don't leave me. Come back, you fish-headed fink. So it is Penguin. - What are you doing out of prison? -I needed a little change of air. - You think you'll get it helping the Joker? -Oh, that pasty-faced felon ran out on me. There's never honor among thieves, Penguin. You, of all people, should know that. Well, at least I helped him make fools of you two. He got the Lion and the Crab in one fell swoop. Holy terminology, Batman. He's right. Leo Crustash. Leo, the Lion and crustacean for the Crab. Joker did get the Lion and the Crab, but we have Penguin. That should make Warden Crichton quite happy. Waugh! Waugh, waugh, waugh. A picture of the Virgin Bereaved one of Gotham City's most valuable art treasures. Worth nearly a cool million, according to experts. And most certainly, Joker's next target. It's the only item on this map that even resembles Virgo, the Virgin. Virgo, the next sign on the Joker's criminal zodiac. It's time for us to make a horoscope, Robin. I predict that within the hour, Joker will be at the museum. And I predict we'll be waiting for him. It's been quite an evening so far, but, uh, boy, will he see stars. Every guard's been alerted to let Joker in but not out. Gosh, this is sure a good place for his total eclipse. -Mm. Well met by moonlight, Batman. As per my calculations on my terms and at my convenience. - Ha-ha-ha. -The odds are all even, Joker. Two against two. Even, my erroneous urchin? Let me cast you a horoscope. Instead of two, you'll discover seven about to give you a free trip to heaven. Ha, ha. First class fencing, Batman. Ha-ha-ha. Sorry. - For what? -My unexpected ally. Venus unobserved. Throw it, you ninny. - Throw it. -Sorry, caped crusaders. The stars demand a sacrifice. To the altar of the sun. Comfy, boys'? Couldn't we call it off, Joker? Mercy to a brave foe and all that? You're losing your nerve, Venus, which is a shame. But you're also losing your senses, which is criminal. Hold her. Batman, I realize right now, I've made a terrible mistake. Repentance is better late than never. Ew. You're making me ill. Ugh! Now I must cancel your horoscopes, caped crusaders. The moment of occlusion is at hand. Ha, ha. Look up. A century ago, that stone dropped from the heavens. At dawn, it will fall again onto your heads. Ha-ha-ha! Mercury, the thermite. - Fiend! -Yes. I'll set that miniature solar system in motion with a thermite bomb attached to the planet Saturn. When it comes around, the thermite will burn through the cable depositing the meteorite onto your dunderheads. Bring her along. She'll recover her criminal senses. Ha, ha! Goodbye, dynamic duo. I predict a falling out. 
Gotham City on a fresh new day which may be fraught with fresh new danger. Olga, wait for me! Olga! Olga, wait for me! Olga! Giddyap. The Bessarovian Cossacks and Egghead. But that street leads directly to police headquarters. Have they gone mad? Bonnie, where is that sandwich I ordered? It just arrived, Commissioner Gordon. I'll send the delivery boy in. Thank you. Oh, oh. Thank you, thank you. Here's a little something for you. Thank you, sir. You're very welcome. Wait a minute. What's going on? I ordered a roast beef sandwich. - This is a poached egg sandwich. -You don't say. - Heh, heh, heh. -Yes, I do say-- A poached egg sandwich? At your service, commissioner. No, no, no, please. No publicity. I'm very shy, you know. You'll find it more difficult to get out than in, Egghead. Oh, I've already made arrangements for my eggs-it, commissioner. You are taking short elevator ride with us. You two will never get away with this. Oh, really, commissioner, I wish someone would write you a new line. That one is getting so tired. Heh, heh. Shall we? Unh. Heh, heh. There. Up we go, me hearties. Heh, heh. Kidnapped? The commissioner's been kidnapped? Batgirl. Thank heavens you're here. But why are you here? Shall we say a hunch, Chief O'Hara? Some sixth sense that things aren't quite right in Gotham City. Not only in Gotham City, but in this office. - The commissioner has been kidnapped. -Kidnapped? My fa-- Commissioner Gordon kidnapped? Somehow he managed to drop this note. But it doesn't say much. I was about to call his daughter Barbara. But she'd likely worry herself to death. Right, Chief O'Hara. Don't call until we know the identities and demands of the kidnappers. Kidnappers? Our fine police commissioner's been abducted, Batman. Out of this very room. Whoever could have done such a dastardly deed? Very likely our arch-foe, that eggs-arable Egghead. And his conniving consort, Olga, queen of the Bessarovian Cossacks. Egghead? Olga, queen of the Cossacks? Rumor has already reached our ear that those two evildoers have joined forces, and in this town. That's why we're here. And it's not surprising that they'd start in this office and with Commissioner Gordon. You're not surprised? What other public personage could demand more respect or be held for a bigger ransom? Gosh, yes. Egghead knows he can ask for the moon and get it. And if he doesn't get it, what will happen to Commissioner Gordon? First things first, Batgirl. I know how Egghead operates. He finds the telephone irresistible. In fact, this one should be ringing momentarily. - Hey! Hey! - Can't you make those wild men of yours quiet down? - Is victory celebration, Eggski. -I know. But I've gotta telephone police headquarters and tell them about our ransom. - Is more important ransom than victory dance. -Yes. Stop the music. That must be Egghead's call. May I take it? - There's no one else in Gotham City who can. -Commissioner Gordon's office. Oh, my, my, how your voice has changed, commissioner. Never mind the bad jokes. I know you have Commissioner Gordon. Oh, do you now, Batman? And do you also know what we want in eggs-change for the dear commissioner's life? What is the ransom? Just 10 cents, Batman. One thin dime for every egg eaten in Gotham City. - It's sort of an egg-cise tax, Batman. - Well, that's unfeasible. Hundreds of thousands of eggs are consumed in Gotham City. - There's no way to keep track of them. -Oh, yes, there is, Batman. The entire Gotham City police force will be mobilized as egg counters and tax collectors. They will make it their business to count every egg that is consumed within the city limits and to collect my egg tax on each one. Otherwise, we'll mail the commissioner back to you in a box. A pine box. We have no choice. The egg tax will be collected. See that it is, Batman. And remember, I'll be making spot checks myself. If every egg isn't counted and paid for it's goodbye, Gordon. Heh, heh. Clear? Quite clear. A 10-cent tax on every egg eaten in Gotham City. Holy eggshells. In a few days, that would add up to millions. Couldn't we ask the people of Gotham City to stop eating eggs? Wait a minute, Robin. If egg consumption in Gotham City were to suddenly decline Egghead might take revenge by harming Commissioner Gordon. Batgirl is right. We'll have to pay the egg tax until we locate and rescue Commissioner Gordon. And I'm afraid the onerous job of collecting that tax is yours, Chief O'Hara. I'll take care of all that, Batman so you can concentrate on locating those scoundrels. I have a plan. It's a long shot, but it just might work. I, too, have a plan, Batman. I suggest we attack the problem separately. With two approaches we have a better chance of locating them. -I hope you're right, Batgirl. Hello, chief. The usual? Right, Gilligan. A large milk and a hot pastrami. Never mind the pastrami. Chief O'Hara would like half a dozen eggs. - How do you like them, chief? -Why, you-- Now, one hand on me and you'll never see your dear commissioner again, chief. You win, Egghead. Now, how did you say you liked your eggs? - Scrambled. -Hm. Bring Chief O'Hara half a dozen-- No, make it a dozen scrambled eggs. Chief, you want me to pounce this guy out of here? No, no, Gilligan. He's a friend. - Just bring the eggs. -A dozen scrambled eggs? I'm feeling a bit hungry this morning, Gilligan. Anything you say. I had to pretend to be cool and objective when it was my very own father who'd been kidnapped. I understand how difficult it must have been for you. - Is there anything I can do? -Yes, that's why I asked you to come here. You're the only person in Gotham City who can help me. I'll gladly give you any assistance I can, Ms. Gordon-- Batgirl, I should say. You have some plan to locate your father? Well, it's only a remote possibility, but at least it's better than nothing. My father uses a very rare brand of aftershave lotion called Wellington Number Four. It's imported from Sumatra. I know the brand. A former employer of mine, the Earl of Chutney, used to use it. If I remember correctly, its ingredients contain a small amount of curry root which gives it a very pungent aroma, quite unlike any other aftershave lotion. Yes, the aroma is unmistakable. I think I guess your plan. But shouldn't we enlist the aid of others? No. Now, think for a moment, Alfred. How would Batgirl know such an intimate fact about Commissioner Gordon, unless, of course? I see your point. But surely Batman and Robin could-- No, no, not them either. My effectiveness as a crime-fighter depends on keeping my identity a secret. And now more than ever, I need that effectiveness. You're right. But I'm afraid it won't be so easy for just the two of us to traverse the whole of Gotham City trying to locate the aroma of a particular aftershave lotion. You're right, Alfred. It's a hopeless task. So I suggest we begin at once. Oh, thank you, Alfred. I would like to be of help, Batman but I have no knowledge of the whereabouts of Olga and her Cossacks. She'd hardly communicate with the embassy since the Cossacks have been at war with the legitimate government of Bessarovia for many centuries. I'm aware of that, Mr. Ambassador. We didn't come here for information, but for help of another kind. By all means, Batman. Believe me, the government of Bessarovia would like to see this woman apprehended as much as you would. Good. It's my suspicion that Olga and her Cossacks may show up here any time. Here? But why should they--? Of course. - The brass samovar of Genghis Khan. -Exactly. The brass samovar of Genghis Khan. Why is it so important? It's a symbol of power, Robin. Like the Stone of Scone to the Scots. Traditionally, anyone who possesses the brass samovar of Genghis Khan is the legitimate ruler of Bessarovia. - What's it doing here, then? -My government sent it for safekeeping since certain opposition parties in my country were planning to steal it. - And you think Olga will try to steal it? -it may be part of the overall plan. First the abduction of Commissioner Gordon, and the egg tax. Now this samovar. A priceless target. The Cossacks have tried to steal the samovar many times before. With your help, Mr. Ambassador, we may make this theft Olga's last. Just tell me what you want me to do, Batman. NARRATOR". As night falls, the Bessarovian Embassy has other visitors. There is prize. Brass samovar of Genghis Khan symbol of Bessarovian power at last is coming to rightful possessor. Quicklymy Cossacks. Hey! Now, now is proof I am imperial queen of Cossacks. Only queen is entitled to brass samovar. Push. Push,push,push. And be careful you don't scratch my beautiful samovar or I will slice you to shreds. Push, push, push, Cossacks. Push,push. NARRATOR". The Cossacks and Olga take the samovar back to their hideout where it joins other collectors' items. There's the commissioner, Batman. I think he's trying to tell us something, Robin. Welcome, malen'kiy Batushka. Put the little mal'chik in cage with old commissioner. And drag handsome to throne. What's this? You've captured the Caped Crusaders? Olga, you eggs-quisite diabolical genius. - But of course. -Yes. How did you do it? - By underhand trick, what else? -Yes. Aha. Malen'kiy Batushka is waking. Handsome. Oh, no troubles, Batushka or we are making shashlik out of little mal'chik and old commissioner. Yes, much better, Batushka. You would like to know perhaps how you are being tricked, huh? Orloff. Your Highness. So you gave us away as a traitor to your country. Who is traitor? I am Bessarovian Cossack from little boy. ls true. Omar is famous magnificent Bessarovian chef. Thank you, Highness. And now I am making greatest Bessarovian borscht of my career. With special ingredients. No, I object. Well, you think cooking in borscht is too cruel, Eggski? No, don't be ridiculous, Olga. It's just that I'd like to kill them now. They're too tricky to play around with. Believe me, I know them. Now that we've got them, let's eggs-terminate them. Who is "we"? I caught them. Besides, I may decide not to cook malen'kiy Batushka. Don't tell me that you're falling for this cowled clown? Maybe. Maybe not. - We are seeing. -But you are engaged to me. How dare you two-time me? And especially with this caped creep. How dare you tell me what to do? Me, Olga, queen of Bessarovian Cossacks. Olga Shmolga. You'd still be washing dishes in that run-down Bessarovian restaurant if it wasn't for me. Be careful. Old Cossack proverb: "Open mouth is leading quickly to open grave. " And don't give me any of your Cossack proverbs either. I say kill him now or I'll-- So much for big-mouth. Now we can have malen'kiy talk, eh, Batushka? You find me attractive little, huh? I'd find you much more attractive if you were on the right side of the law, Olga. - This kind of life can only lead to trouble. -Heh, heh. Is better making love than sermons, Batushka. Otherwise you are going into pot with others. A little kiss maybe? A little kiss not maybe. Maybe I give you little kiss. Hm? The great Bessarovian borscht of my career. Beautiful, beautiful. Step right in there. This will be beautiful, beautiful. Ha, ha. Oh, very nice. Well, you are no longer in Bessarovia, Olga. In this country, the standards are different. You should abide by our customs, not yours. On contrary I am considering this place malen'kiy piece of Bessarovia. Here, we are following my customs. And my customs are requiring wedding borscht made from captured prisoners. - Wedding borscht? -Of course, Batushka. But I thought you were engaged to marry Egghead. I am marrying both of you. Cossack queen is permitted up to six husbands. Oh, but do not worry, Batushka. You will always be number one in my heart. Batgirl, this is Alfred. I have just detected the unmistakable aroma of Wellington Number Four. Where are you, Alfred? In front of a warehouse at number 12 Bannister Street. - I'll be right there. -Good. It's unmistakable, Alfred. Wellington Number Four coming from inside this warehouse. Oh, you can't go in alone, Batgirl. If nothing else, I'll go in with you and provide a diversion. No, Alfred, I would never forgive myself if you got hurt. Now, you must stay here. Soon you are both becoming my husbands. Well, it's worth playing second fiddle just to see Batman married. 'Batgirl! 'Batgirl? Batgirl. They need help. They can't handle all those Cossacks alone. You are both staying right here in pot. - Here. -What? Alfred, Bruce Wayne's butler. What are you--? No time to explain now, commissioner. - There we go. -Thank you, Alfred. I'm with you, Batman. Oh, help me, Eggski. You must do something. My Cossacks are falling like vodka bottles. So you admit you need my help, eh, Olga? - Bygones be bygones. -All right, come over here. I've been saving this little surprise for just such an eggs-igency. Heh, heh. Yes, these hens have been fed a straight diet of onions for the past six months. Onions? What is from these onions? You just wait a minute, my dear, and you'll see. Out of my way. All right, Egghead, your turn has come to-- Unh! What--'? I-- Have a good cry, Batman. You'll need it. Oh! Oh! Yes. You'll discover that kidnapping police commissioners is-- - Are you all right, Batman? -Yes, commissioner. But I'm afraid they've escaped. And Egghead used a particularly powerful form of tear gas. Holy crying towels, Batman. - This stuff is terrible. -I know. At least you're safe, Commissioner Gordon. Yes, Batgirl, but is Gotham City safe? I'm afraid Gotham City won't be safe until those Cossacks are behind bars. NARRATOR". How right he is. Gotham City faces disaster with Egghead, Olga and the Cossacks on the loose. When and how will it end? Will it end? Maybe we'll get an inkling in our next episode. 
NARRATOR". When last we left our brave boys they were encased by Catwoman in a giant echo chamber where the drip-drip-drop of a faucet was magnified 10 million times. If they don't find some solution their magnificent minds will be reduced to oatmeal thereby rendering them useless for a great many things. Stay glued to your seat. The worst is yet to come. Robin. Every room has its sympathetic vibration. A note that will shatter glass like the great Caruso did with his voice. The note for this room should be F-sharp above high C. Wow. - I think I'll be hard of hearing for a while. -What? I said, "Wow, I think I'll be hard of hearing for a while. " You'll have to speak a little louder, Robin. I think I'll be hard of hearing for a while. Whew. - Robin. -No, Belgoody. Call Chief O'Hara and have him pick this bounder up. Right, Batman. All right, Belgoody, tell me everything. Every--? Well, I was born in Youngstown of poor but honest parents. Come off it, Belgoody. You're pulling my boot. - What's Catwoman's plan? -Hm-hm. You're too late, Batman. You're too late. Because right at this very moment in history Catwoman is stealing the voices of Chad and Jeremy at the Policeman's Ball. Their voices? So that's it. What a fiendish plan. Chief O'Hara and his men will be right over. We must get to Gotham City Town Hall immediately, Robin. Let's tie him up quickly. NARRATOR". And at Gotham City Town Hall on the other side of town the joint is really jumping. And now here they are, the music world's dynamic duo Chad and Jeremy. Sweet, soft summer nights Dancing shadows Are your see-in-the-dark glasses in order, Meanie, Miney, Moe'? - You bet. -They sure are. Ready to go. You came For me to follow And we kissed On distant shores Long, quiet hours of play Sounds of tomorrow Let's get them. Love came You said they couldn't get away, Catwoman. And yet they did. And so will we. I can't see, Batman. Neither can I, Robin. But then again, neither can they. Oh, yes, we can. Cats can always see in the dark, especially with these glasses. Ha-ha-ha! Come on, kittens. We've done it! - Let's go after them, Batman. -No, Robin. I'm afraid it's too late. We must stay here and restore order. With 5000 screaming teenagers, someone is liable to get hurt. Citizens. Citizens. Hi, kids. NARRATOR". And on the following morning two special guests appear on the Allan Stevens television show. - Now, you were saying-- - As I was saying, America must have faith that the law will recover the voices of Chad and Jeremy. I understand millions of the world's teenagers are in mourning since last night's tragedy. Yes, that's quite true, Mr. Stevens. But on the plus side, millions of parents are delighted. Speaking as an average, ordinary, red-blooded, typical American teenager this is one of the worst things that could have happened. Fans, you have our assurance that Catwoman will be captured and that the voices of Chad and Jeremy will be restored before another sun sets on Gotham City. The sun also rises, smarty-tights. Keep the audience covered. If anyone moves, hit them with a sonic beam blast. - Crush them, Batman. -Hold it, Robin. They appear to be desperate. They might fire on the audience. You bet your baby blue eyes we would. We'll continue with this tense scene in just a moment, but first-- And now, right back to you, Catwoman. What is it you want, Catwoman? Eight million pounds for the return of their voices. Eight million pounds of what? Chicken fat? Sorry I asked. It comes to a grand total of 22,400,000 American dollars and I want it fast. How do we know you really have their voices and will return them? Sweet, soft summer nights But that's impossible. Nobody will pay that much money for those voices. England will. Because England swings like a pendulum do. Or does. England? Of all the preposterous plans. You can't hold up an entire country. Wanna bet? Chad and Jeremy pay so much income tax to their native land, that if it were to stop the whole empire might crumble and the British pound would be deflated. And once that happens the entire economic structure of the world would collapse. - How dastardly. -All right, you've heard my deal. You got until tomorrow noon to come up with the scratch. If not, I'll turn my voice-eraser loose on everyone. Now, just a darn minute here. You can't come in here and thre-- Come on, kittens. Let's shake a paw. The sneeze bomb ought to keep you busy for a while. Ah. Batman and Robin. Ah, welcome to my humble office. I am Sir Sterling Habits. How do you do? And how do you do? Heh. And what brings you here at such an early hour of the morning? By this time, you're aware of the serious tragedy affecting your country's most popular export. Have we stopped making those small sports oars? We're referring to Chad and Jeremy. Oh, yes, those blighters. Hm. Can't understand a word they say. Why can't the English learn to speak? Have you consulted your government about the ransom demands? Oh, yes, indeed. Parliament has been overtime on it. - And? -Well I'm expecting a telephone call from them at any moment now. Hello? Oh, Harold. How are you? Yes. Uh-huh, quite. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. You're quite sure? Ah, hm. Well, thank you very much indeed. Pip-pip. Well, that was them, or should I say "they. " Well, it doesn't matter anyhow. They will not accede to Catwoman's demands. Their feelings about Chad and Jeremy are: millions for their records not a cent for their ransom. - Yes. Well, thank you, Sir Sterling. -Not at all. Yes, what is it, Rhett? Begging your pardon, sir, but a large crowd have gathered outside the consulate having heard the Dynamic Duo are here. I fear at this moment, time's too precious to spend with our admirers. We must get cracking. L-- I'm afraid they have all entrances covered, sir. To the window, Robin. Cheerio, Sir Sterling. Don Ho, what are you doing here? Well, I came back to get some land we lost back in Hawaii. And to do a little singing here in Gotham City, I hope. Well, I brought my most important prop along. It's gotten me as far as your Batropes have gotten you. Yeah, I think I'll introduce Batropes in Hawaii. Pick coconuts more easy that way. I'd like to sit here and chat with you all day, Don, but The surfs coming up and we gotta catch a big one. Okay, fellas, I understand. Aloha. Aloha. All of our men are out there in the field, Batman but they're not making a bit of headway. Poor Commissioner Gordon is still without his voice. I think she's got us licked. The game is never over until the last out is made, chief. Never say die. We've had some dark moments in the past, haven't we? - Yes, I know, but this-- -Fear not. The criminal always makes one mistake. I'm sure she did too. There's no such thing as the perfect crime. Well, I, for one, can't think of a single mistake she made. She even had the audacity to phone me right here in Commissioner Gordon's office this morning. - You remember anything she said, chief? -Better than that. I tape-recorded most of the conversation. Sound thinking. - Holy resourcefulness. -I couldn't have put it better myself, Robin. It's no wonder you've risen to the top of your department, Chief O'Hara. Chief y, what I want is money. You got four hours before I start using my voice-eraser on everyone. Today Gotham City, tomorrow the world. The gall of that woman. Do you mind if I take this with me, Commissioner Gordon? "Not at all. But Why?" I heard a strange noise in the background. We might just be able to identify it on the Bat-sound Analyzer. Courage. We'll have your voice back before you can say "Jack Robinson. " Come on, Robin. There's not much time. Think it'll work, Batman? It has to work, Robin. The world's at stake. This will determine if that sound in the background is something unique and traceable. - Batman, there's something I don't understand. -Yes? I realize that losing the power of speech is an awful thing but why do you feel that the whole world's at stake? Simple. - If we couldn't talk, there'd be no telephones. -Oh. You see, there are millions of people who use telephones in business every day. Now they'd have to meet their clients face-to-face. Oh. That would cause enormous traffic problems. Further, all the people who work for the world's phone companies would lose their jobs. There'd be no such thing as radio, television and movies would go silent. - Oh. -There's a whole host of ramifications. And Catwoman can do all that? If we let her. Now let's see what that noise in the background is. "Three hair dryers. " Hair dryers? If I remember correctly, Robin there are over 2000 beauty salons in Gotham City. There's just not enough time, unless Unless what, Batman? Unless the effects of the voice-eraser wear off after a while. If that's true, Robin, we don't have to worry at all. - Gosh, Batman, I hope so. -You go topside, Robin and see if Chad and Jeremy have recovered their voices. I'll push on here. Aye, aye, sir. - Any luck, Alfred? -I'm afraid not, Master Dick. Your aunt and I have tried every remedy we can think of but, uh, it appears that Chad and Jeremy may well have been stilled forever. It may not be long before we're all in the same condition. There must be some way out. What is it, Alfred? It seems that they want to go out to get their hair done. Boy, I thought I'd heard everything. Yes. To Mr. Oceanbring's on Pickford Street. Mr. Oceanbring's? The world-famous men's hairstylist? It's the latest rage, Master Dick. Almost every rock 'n' roll star goes to have his hair coiffed by Mr. Oceanbring. Are there hair dryers at Mr. Oceanbring's? Thanks. Well, what in the world could he have meant by that? Well, madam, urn apparently something about the hair dryers at Mr. Oceanbring's seemed particularly attractive to-- Uh-- Yes. One day without the power to speak and the whole world will be at our knees. Ha. Then they'll pay anything to get their voices back. Ha. Being an honorable crook I'd let them off the hook for a measly $22,400,000. - We should have finished off Batman. - And Robin. When we had the chance. Oh, I couldn't bring myself to do it, boys. Even though I don't care very much for that Boy Wonder Batman did save my life once. I owe him that. If we do steal everyone's voices, how do we give them back after we get paid off? Ah. With this devilishly clever little formula. Easily compounded of sweet basil, garlic, salt and goat's milk in the right proportion. Twelve noon. Time to make the call. Quentin 3-3700. Sorry, wrong number, Catwoman. Batman. Batman, whyfor art thou doing this to me? It's my job, Catwoman. I am sworn to uphold the law. But if you'd just come down off your high horse for a moment we could make such beautiful music together. You'll play a different tune when we're through, and all the notes will be sour. Party pooper. Teenagers should be seen and not heard. All right, men, destroy the Dynamic Duo. Watch the antiques. Gentle with Batman, boys. Stay until Chief O'Hara arrives and guard them. Someone let Catwoman out of the bag. I can't let her get away now. The sonic beam in this gun can slice like a hot knife through the high-priced spread. Ah, but I've reached an impasse. Shall I steal your voice or end your life? Whichever you decide, I'm sure it'll be the wrong choice. You have a pretty sharp tongue for a man about to say goodbye to this world, Batman. Beg. Beg for your mortal existence. I'd rather die than beg for such a small favor as my life. What are you waiting for? Can't you see how I feel about you, Batman? How I want you by my side. It won't work, Catwoman. If you're going to kill me, you might as well get it over with. I can't kill the only man that I've Don't worry, Catwoman. You wouldn't have killed me even though you shot the gun. The Anti Bat-sonic device in my Utility Belt would have deflected the beam. Ha-ha. Well, it was a good plot while it lasted. Yes, Catwoman, one of your very best. Thank you. But still the problem remains. How do we undo what you did? - The stolen voices? -Yes. Oh, well, you just, uh, have them all spray their throats with the atomizer. - Get them back to normal in seconds. Heh. -Amazing. Hm. Uh, you see, my voice-eraser electronically loosened their vocal chords and, uh, just have them spray it and it'll, uh, tighten them right back up again. - Amazing. -Mm. Batman, when I get out of jail, will you take me on a date? Well, I have plenty of time to think about that, Catwoman. Several years, I'm afraid. If I were to kiss you, would you think I was a bad girl? But, uh-- No. No, of course not, Catwoman. Kissing is one of the most natural things in the world. Uh, some people kiss almost every day, I'm told. Well Come on, Batman. The police are here. Boy Blunder. Catwoman, may I take a rain check on that kiss? Certainly, Batman. Anytime. Holy mush. Went up to my boss today I said, "Hey, man, can I have more pay?" I said, "Will, you, please, sir?" He took one look at me and then He said, "If you ask me that again I'll kill you" Aren't they great, Alfred? Well, they certainly do sway, don't they? - Very hep, Alfred. -it's "hip," Aunt Harriet. They changed it. It's just to do and die, I know But even so It seems that the world Has passed me over Same sort of thing With the birds in this town I pick 'em up They put me down Still you can't complain much If I had a fancy car Mercedes or a Jaguar I'd thrill her Well, Bruce Wayne. Commissioner, nice to hear your voice again. Do I have to cry? Ours not to reason why, I know It's just to do and die, I know But even so It seems that the world Has passed me over My, uh, grandchildren insisted that I come and hear their Chad and Jeremy. A bit on the groovy side, aren't they? Every era has its own music, commissioner its own art, its own manner of speech. Of course, the essence of progress is change. A point well taken, Mrs. Cooper. But there's one pair in the public eye which I pray will never suffer the stigma of antiquity. Batman and Robin, commissioner? You took the words right out of my mouth, Mrs. Cooper. It's just to do and die, I know But even so It seems that the world Has passed me over 
Batman So far we have seen in the lobby of a silent film festival an unscheduled diversion. The tramp was The Riddler. What the blazes was his game? He was after a roll. A tasty payroll. But this roll had a twist. A crooked crew behind a movie camera. And two stars who didn't know they were in the picture. A trap! Caught again on film. And in the abandoned cutting room of a bankrupt movie studio The Riddler and his felonious filmsters enjoy the show. And got ready for an even stranger one. Temper tonic. Poured into innocent lemonade at Mr. Van Jones' temperance party. Incredible affect. Friends turn into snarling beasts. A free for all. And down in the driveway, a damsel in distress. Oh, yeah? Robin? Where's Robin? In the Riddler's filthy clutches. Kindling for the biting buzzsaw. We warned you before, we warn you again in just one minute, you will a Boy Wonder sawed in two. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na Batman Meanwhile, even as the buzzsaw spins a desperate Batman races from the scene of Mr. Van Jones' fatal party bent on pursuit of Robin's captors. Horrors! The Boy Wonder's tiny utility belt radio lost in the struggle. No way of contacting him now. Batman! Wait! I'm so ashamed, Batman, the way I behaved at that party. It's not your fault, commissioner. Riddler's henchmen spiked your drinks with temper tonic. Now you've taken my universal drug antidote you'll be alright. Yes, but still my unseemly behavior certainly contributed towards Robin's capture. Let that be a lesson. In future, be more careful from whom you accept free lemonade. What the blazes! 'Great Scott, Batman! Look up there. ' A parachute blossoming. "A bear like a fallen tree?" Easy. A bear lumbers and a fallen tree becomes lumber. Good grief! Another one. '"Why is silk like grass?"' Even easier. You measure both by the yard. Lumberyard. . The Gotham Lumberyard! That must be where he's holding Robin. 'Goodbye, commissioner. ' Speed to headquarters. I'll call you if I need help. Goodbye, Batman. Save that boy! Robin! Robin! Do you hear me? Too late. He's history now, Batman. I'll do better than that, Riddler. Question. When is a man a stupid relative, huh? I've heard enough of your murderous riddles. Surprise, Batman. This is what is known in the film game as a two-parter. Look! "When is a man like a stupid relative?" When he's a mannequin. A dummy. Robin? Riddler? Stop! Surrender! Give yourself up. By all that's holy I might forget myself and do you violence. My name is Pauline. My lawyer's name is Mr. Oliver Wendell. Why don't you look him up and buzz him? No use, Batman. She's hard as nails. Knows her legal rights too. A frustrated, would-be actress. . a star that was never born venting her disappointment on society. Only one thing to do, commissioner. Take her to the Batcave and work on her. Great Scott, Batman. Revealing its location will be tantamount to. . taking off your mask. Not quite, commissioner. Before the trip, I intend to render her senseless with a whiff of Batgas. Hey, now, wait a minute. I'd like you to come along too, commissioner. Me? To the Batcave? When it's a question of Robin's safety I don't entirely trust myself. I'd like a witness present to make sure that I don't employ methods which might bounce back on me in court. Well, of course, if you wish my presence, Batman, I'll. . Uh, Batgas for me as well? It's a precaution I have to take, commissioner. If you were captured and tortured by criminals you might reveal the location of the Batcave. I place myself in your hands, Batman with the most serene confidence. Sit down, commissioner. Restrain her, Chief O'Hara. Hey! Hey, wait. Wait, I want my lawyer. Help! No, don't you dare. I assure you, commissioner, the sensation is not unpleasant. Your handkerchief? Great science! Chief O'Hara, summon some men. We'll need help in getting them to the Batmobile. Great Scott! At last, the fabulous Batcave. - Unusual, isn't it? - Oh, magnificent! I feel as if I've awakened in some future age. Such equipment. What fantastic ingenuity you and the Boy Wonder have employed in hooking it together. True. We did muster many long hours of brain power. However, this is no time for self-congratulation. A small demonstration will now take place. - A demonstration? - Yes, commissioner. Take this can of Batwake. When I give you this signal spray a whiff of it in the prisoner's face. Certainly. You will notice, commissioner, that this Batmask in most ways resembles an ordinary operating room oxygen mask. I will introduce no drugs, no serums into Pauline's bloodstream. I understand. Now, commissioner. - Give her the Batwake, please. - Oh-oh, yeah. Where am I? Deep. . in the entrails of the earth, Pauline. Where every instrument has been designed to combat crime and smear its perpetrators. There are those who came to this Batcave and never left. That is true. Now, tell me. Where is Robin being held? I don't know. Are you sure? Yes, I'm. . I only know. . 'Yes. ' 'the clues, two riddles. ' Give them. Why was Flo Zigfield like a nearsighted man? Because they both put on spectacles. Two? What kind of men are always above board? Chessmen. Join me over here, commissioner. Watch very carefully, commissioner. I'm going to mingle Pauline's captured breath with a clear liquid in this container. What do you hope to discover, Caped Crusader? The truth, commissioner. If Pauline's answers were true then the oxygen content of her breath will turn this liquid red. If, however, she lied then the increase in her metabolism will increase the oxygen content of her breath and cause an imbalance which will leave this liquid clear and undisturbed. Do you understand? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Now. . for the test. Would you squeeze the bag, commissioner? Thank you. Fantastic! Oh, I doff my hat to you, Batman. No wonder you're the nemesis of crime. Obviously you were telling the truth, young lady. A wise decision, I promise you. Commissioner. You observed I used no undue methods to extract that confession. Oh, none whatever. I'd affirm that in the highest court in the land. But what do those strange clues mean, Batman? Simple, commissioner. Look at it in the context of the theme which has run throughout this entire case. Silent movies. Uh, clue one. Spectacles. Harold Lloyd of course. He always wore spectacles. And he was often found perilously balanced on the ledge of a high building. Chessmen. The Chessman Building! Right, commissioner. I'll call Chief O'Hara on the Batphone alert where to find you along the roadside. I'll also tell him that he will find the standby container of Batwake in your right-hand coat pocket. Uh, right. Oh, thank you. This, uh. . This has been a privilege, Batman. A rare privilege. I thank you. - You're welcome. - Fire away. Meanwhile, on a narrow ledge just below the roof of the venerable Chessman Building the Riddler and his felonious filmsters prepare to shoot a shattering spectacle. Stolen straight from Harold Lloyd. Coming up. . the last reel in our drama starring the Boy Wonder going down. This time. . no whimsical dummy, but the real thing. You lowdown fiend, what's the point of all of this? Comedy, Boy Wonder. Light-hearted comedy to accommodate a connoisseur. Riddler, this life of crime has finally softened your brain. Question. Can a robin fly if his wings are clipped? You won't earn a nickel murdering me, Riddler. This doesn't make sense. Correct, Boy Wonder. Not cents, dollars! At least one million dollars. Rehearsal. Make sure my safety belt doesn't show. Sure, Riddler baby. 'Make with the action. ' Whoa-oh-oh! Whoa-a-a-a! Whoa-a-a-a! Cut! End of rehearsal. This time, we film it. Uh, but little difference, ya? Ya. Little difference. This time, the Boy Wonder makes the plunge. Rolling. Little mood music] Robin! Curses! The Batrope! Grab it with your teeth. Hold on, Robin. Tight. I'll raise you back up to the ledge. - Are you alright, Robin? - Holy molars! Am I ever gonna take good care of my teeth. True. You owe your life to dental hygiene. If only more people. . Those cowardly crooks! They're escaping again. Only if we had our Batcopter. Holy smokes! Sky writing. - More clues, no doubt. - You're right, Batman. Look! A riddle! "What kind of machine has ears?" That one's for a nursery school. A train of course. A train has engineers. You want to land us all back up in the pen again, baby? Lackeys, you don't realize these clues have a false meaning. "A cowboy wear a tight belt?" The same reason a policeman or anyone else does. To hold up his pants. A train. A hold up. Well, the El Chief! - Which? - The El Chief, Batman That famous train which all the movie people used to take. The Riddler's planning to hold it up. - Fits like a glove. - Yes, it does. Very good thinking, Robin. Commissioner Gordon? Robin, calling from the Batmobile. Thank heavens, Boy Wonder, you are safe. - How do you feel? - Just great. - How do you feel? - No nauseous after-effects. Tell Batman it was like waking from a strange refreshing dream. I'll do that, commissioner. In the meantime, here's a red hot tip. Send every man you've got to Gotham Central Station. Stake-out that famous train. The El Chief. A strange and shocking twist to the plot. For even as the defenders of law and order descend on Gotham Central Station the Riddler shows up on the other side of the city. At the mansion of Mr. Van Jones famed fancier of old silent films. Well, come in. Mr. Riddler, at last. Yeah. I have it right here, Mr. Van jones. My silent masterpiece. The only silent movie ever made of Batman and Robin in action. I can hardly wait. Oh. Imagine. The first silent epic film in almost four decades. . mine. What a triumph for a collector like myself. But, come on, let's run it. Come on. Sensational, Mr. Riddler. Worth every penny of the $100,000 I contracted to pay you. I thank you, Mr. Van Jones. Just a moment, I'll put this film in the safe. And get you your check. Would you excuse me? Have no fear for the safety of your epic, Mr. Riddler. I'll keep it with my others. In this burglar-proof vault. It can be opened by positively no one but myself. Mr. Van Jones. . why are you like a clock at midnight? Answer. 'Cause both your hands are going straight up right now. What is this? This is your last reel. 'Step aside. ' But my films! You can't take them. They're priceless. Oh, I think we'll find a price. . 'when you try to ransom it back. ' This way, partners. No sheriff, Riddler baby? 'Hos, he went that-a-way. . to the train station. Hurry it up, boys. Clean out that safe and let's head for them hills. Blazes! A bat shadow. Same old ending, Riddler. It never fails. Thought you had us fooled with your double-dealing clues, huh? "The Great Train Hold-Up. " The most famous silent film ever made. 'And the only existing print' is right here in the Van Jones safe. Get him, boys. Get him, or we'll never make it to the border. Good heavens! Call Chief O'Hara, Robin. Tell him we have the entire cast right here. Cast? You're about to star in a picture of your very own, Riddler. A long picture. Titled, "Up The River. " Alfred, why are you dawdling so? We're gonna be late at the restaurant. - Is that so, madam? - Well, of course it's so. We're due to meet Dick and Bruce there at 8:00. As you say, madam. Alfred. . really, and on my birthday too. Dick and Bruce promised they'd have a big surprise for me. And that's precisely what I shouldn't wish you to miss. - Happy Birthday, Mrs. Cooper. - Many happy returns. Merciful heavens to Betsy, it's Batman and Robin. My friend Bruce Wayne contacted me through the commissioner. He said you'd always wanted to meet the Dynamic Duo. 'Kind of like a birthday surprise, Mrs. Cooper. ' - It's an honor, ma'am. - And a pleasure too. May we take the liberty? - I think we better run, Batman. - That's right, Robin. We'll be late for that appointment we have tonight. Happy birthday again, Mrs. Cooper. Quickly, let's race to the Batmobile. Oh, Alfred. Alfred, imagine. They kissed me. Will Bruce and Dick ever believe that when I tell them? Oh, I'm sure they will. After all, I was a witness. Madam. Next week, the Penguin waddles again. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". Another bright, brisk morning in Gotham City. For such a bustling metropolis, the day seems to have begun quite normally. But wait, do we sense something slightly off-key? Here in the Keyborn Bookstore perhaps? Or in the Keynote Music Shop? Or even in the sacred precincts of the ultra conservative Gotham City Key Club? Meanwhile, at Wayne Manor stately home of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson All right, take it from the top, Dick. Ahem. Besides its famous apes and the part it's always played in history, the Rock of Gibraltar is also famous for? -It's the key to the Mediterranean. -Aha. Right, Dick. You might make that the keynote of your geography paper. - A headache, Bruce? -No, no, just a bit weary. But thanks to the brief respite from crime-fighting which we seem to be enjoying, my energies will be quickly restored. What? Upside down? Pointing the wrong way? Hmm. We'll get right on it. That was the manager of the Keystone Building. Someone has been playing havoc with the big sign identifying it. Probably the work of some prankster, heh, or some joker. Jo-- Of course, Chief O'Hara. Who else but that malevolent mischief-maker could be taunting us again with his capricious capers? You still don't think we should call the Caped Crusader? When books, records and files are involved, Chief O'Hara I think that we should try to tackle the problem ourselves but when it comes to tampering with the buildings of our fine city we have no other choice. I think I found it, Bruce. I'm afraid you spoke too soon, sir. Let me answer it for you. I can always think up a bit of a taradiddle. No, Alfred, if the commissioner needs us, this is no time for a white lie, even the smallest. - Yes, commissioner? -I'm afraid it's the Joker again, Batman. We'll be right there. To the Batpoles. We're having the locks replaced in this building. And when the new keys arrived today, this was in with them. - Holy vertebra. - Indeed. A macabre little opener. Read the attached note. "Latched or mastered, skeletoned or passed spot the Scot before you're outclassed. " Latched or mastered? I suspect he used the past tense to further confuse us, Robin. Latch, master, pass, skeleton. They're all terms which refer to keys. Like the Key Club or the Keystone Building. Some seventh sense tells me that this particular Scot is billionaire Angus Ferguson the famous Scottish collector who's currently visiting our fair city. Just what I was thinking, Batman, now that you, uh, reminded me. Obviously there is a connection here. Mr. Ferguson is having a private showing today of his fabulous collection of keys. How can anyone have a fabulous collection of keys? There are some famous keys in the world, Robin. Of which Angus Ferguson has either the original or an exact replica including the piÃ©ce de rÃ©sistance of his current show the famous Jeweled Key of Kaincardine handed down through the ages from one Scottish ruler to another. Hmm. Holy key ring. Where is this showing? At his private suite at Gotham Towers. We have as many of our men posted there as we can spare but, ha, ha, if this note is from the Joker I suggest we take a look at Ferguson's fabulous collection of keys. Ah. This should do it. Ah. Ah! At last, success beyond even my wildest dreams. Success, Joker, because you can turn an itsy-bitsy key in an itsy-bitsy box? Glad you could tear yourself away from that mirror for one minute, Cornelia to admire my latest triumph. This box, and particularly this key I've just made could be the downfall of those audacious adversaries, Batman and Robin and give me free reign to pursue my cunning career. Ha, ha! - How did you make the box, Joker? -Oh, out of bits and pieces, lads. Odds and ends, cheese paddings, lightning bugs, cockroach shells all combined with my talents in other fields, of course. Ha, ha. But enough of this chitchat. I am off to make my first experiment. And when I return, I suspect I will not only have confounded the Dynamic Duo but I will have in my possession the Jeweled Key of Kaincardine. - The what? -Ho-ho-ho. The diamonds with which it is encrusted are worth a king's ransom, Cornelia. Not to mention the rubies in its loop, the emeralds in its stern the sapphires in its collar, and the fire opals in its bit. Ah. It's so good. Aye. The Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder. Well, it's good to have you here. Help yourself to a doch-an-dorris. It's a breath of heather from me brewster, my golly. Thank you, Mr. Ferguson, but we'd just like to browse a bit. Browse, aye, browse. Browse to the content of your stout heart. What's a doch-an-dorris? Gaelic for stirrup cup, Robin. - A drink usually taken on parting. -You think he wants to get rid of us'? I think we should try to act as casual as possible, old chum. Hmm. A rare acquisition. "The key to the Bastille cell block in which the man in the iron mask was imprisoned. " How could Mr. Ferguson have gotten that? A golden key opens every lock, Robin. Shall we? Holy keyhole. If there's any dirty work afoot, you can be sure this key is the hoped-for target. It must be worth a fortune. More than a fortune, Boy Wonder. It's priceless. And you're right, Batman, my target is the Jeweled Key of Kaincardine. Which, luckily, we will prevent you from obtaining. Ho-ho! I wonder, Caped Crusader. I anticipated your presence here today. And I believe my newest invention will render you helpless while I transfer ownership of the priceless jeweled key. - Are you all right, Robin? -I think so, Batman. What happened? - I'm not sure. -Look, it's gone. It certainly is gone. It most certainly is gone. And if that key is nay found and returned at once I'll sue this city for $8,000,523 and a threepenny bit. - But, Mr. Ferguson-- -The charge will be grand larceny. You'll hear from my law agent because you can say "Jack McRobinson. " And you, you two muttonheads, after I offered you a wee doch-an-dorris Gotham City still holds you in great esteem, Dynamic Duo. The word, uh, "muttonheads" was most unfortunate. It was right. We were standing in that alcove while the Joker made off with the jeweled key. It's hard to explain. What did happen, Batman? He had some kind of contraption, a small box with a key. Which sparked and hummed. He said it would render us helpless while he pulled off the robbery. And it did. Although, I don't know exactly how yet. If this device could do that to the two of you, think-- I have thought, commissioner. The theft of the Jeweled Key of Kaincardine is only secondary. There are many devious tricks up that crafty clown's sleeve. He must be stopped before he makes a laughing stock, not only of Robin and me your fine department but all of Gotham City. And in conclusion, let me repeat the hope that Batman and Robin were in no way helping the Joker steal the Jeweled Key of Kaincardine from Mr. Ferguson's collection today just because the Dynamic Duo stood by ineffectively. Ineffectively? What an unpleasant innuendo. There is a rumor around Gotham City tonight that the Joker has some new invention against which the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder are powerless. Enough of rumors. It's about time for The Green Hornet. You're right, Bruce. Citizens of Gotham City, this is the Joker. Corning to you through your key station via my high-powered jamming system and particularly addressing Batman, wherever you are. Foiled, failed, frustrated and so defenseless, I'll even give you a clue to my next crime. Don't give a hoot for the hobnailed, but look for a bow and a bobtail. Joker is in one of his more generous moods providing us with clues. Let's provide him with a little action. To the Batpoles. In his strange and evil way, Robin the Joker sometimes exhibits a bit of twisted honesty. I think we can ignore the first half of the clue as he suggested and concentrate on "look for a bow and bobtails. " What do you mean, "twisted honesty"? He's trying to stomp us, isn't he? Let's say he wants us to take his tricky bait the hard way. Like we did today. I think I have the solution to that too, Robin. When he was younger, the Joker was a well-known hypnotist. - Holy mesmerism. -Exactly. Catching us off-guard and using that ingenious box and key as a temporary diversion he momentarily had us in his power. But that's water under the bridge. Now, "look for a bow and bobtails. " A bow. Bow nut, bowline, bowlegs, Bo Peep-- Rainbow? No, I suspect there is some other key t-- Key. Of course. The loop of a key. The handle is also called a bow. Now, bobtails. Bobtailed horse, bobtailed drawbridge. Bobtailed flush in poker, bobtailed lynx. Lynx? Cufflinks? A golf course? L-Y-N-X. A bobtailed species of wild cat with a valuable fur varying in color of-- That's it, Robin. And the way he emphasized "foiled, failed, frustrated and defenseless. " Sure, Batman. He must have the key to Franchin's Fancy Fur Salon. Let's go. One moment, Robin. This requires unusual precaution. Oh, I know diamonds are supposed to be a girl's best friend but I could get real chummy with some mink or ermine. Oh, I'll take three or four of these and a couple of gorillas. I think you mean chinchilla, Cornelia. One of the rarest and most costly of furs. Oh, well, that's exactly what I mean. Aren't you afraid we'll get caught in a place like this, this time of night? Ha. With my duplicate key to the manager's office we came through his private entrance. Which has no burglar alarm. And Latch and Bolt are in the front hall, on guard. Ho-ho! With two recruits. Ha, ha! But what about the clue you broadcast to Batman? Aha. Precisely why I brought my little magic box. I'm looking forward to giving Batman and Robin another taste of its unique power. - This time the joke's going to be on the Joker. -So let's get the jump on him. Ooh! Ho-ho-ho! Good evening, friends. Something's wrong. The key must be broken. It's not the key to that box that's broken, Joker, it's your hypnotic power over us. Well, it worked before. This time we took our counter-hypnosis Bat-pellets from our Bat-capsule dispensary. Latch, Bolt, everybody! Nothing but some wires and a little battery. Exactly, Robin. We didn't give him time to induce hypnosis. But as I've said, that monstrous mountebank is full of mad maneuvers. Would you like me to bring down some breakfast, sir? The human body can only go so long without proper food, drink and sleep. It's only been one night, Alfred. And we have to trap the Joker once and for all. If I might suggest a thought, sir? Oh, please, do. It struck me that recently most of his messages have involved twists on words. Wordplays on keys, particularly. Now, if in his private life-- Precisely the course we've been pursuing, Alfred. Robin, what have you come up with? Keyboard, key bugle, key fruit, keynote address key signature, Keystone State. Uh, by "private life," I meant a change of identity. Possibly an assumed name. - Holy pseudonym. -Of course, Alfred, why didn't we think of that? Would you mind handing me the telephone directory? - Here you are, sir. -Thank you. I programmed a Batcomputer feedback circuit to isolate key name metaphors in the greater Gotham City telephone directory. It's gotta be one of these. Mrs. Carrie B. Keypin. No, I don't think he'd be masquerading as a woman. - The Locker Room? -An English grill I occasionally frequent. Superb suet pudding. Louie Latch? What about this one? Clavier Ankh. - Clavier Ankh? What kind of a name is that? -A very revealing name, Robin. The clavier is the keyboard of an organ. An ankh is a sacred Egyptian cross symbolizing the key of life. Gosh, Batman. And the address. "Number 1, Dugan Alley. " That's worthy of note. -It's a cool pad, Joker. -Ha. All you've seen of this cool pad, Cornelia, is that mirror. Vanity is a waste of time. I never look at myself. Well, I'm younger, Joker, and a girl. And it is a cool pad. Well, it will do for the purpose. Do you think Batman's smart enough to find it? Oh, he's an adversary almost worthy of me, Cornelia but soon will only be the skeleton of one. And sooner than I planned, in fact. There's the Batmobile now. The Dynamic Duo are somewhat unorthodox, Cornelia. No doubt they'll come up the outside wall. You know what to do. And Latch and Bolt are waiting to help while Uncle Clavier double-checks his Human Key Duplicator. You mean a real live one? Uh, you'll see, Cornelia. Oh, at last the end of Batman and Robin is in sight. And I can start planning the craftiest caper of my career. Your, uh, daily workout, Batman? Yes. Crime-fighters have to stay in shape. - But you know that. -Well, my job is a little easier. Sometimes a fast gun has the edge on a fast Bat-rope. I'm not invading your territory. I'm just tracking down a clue incognito. Welcome and good luck. If you need help, locate us through Commissioner Gordon's office. The Batphone number is unlisted. Smart thinking. Don't slip. Brave men, Jim. You startled me. I'm sorry, young lady. We're here to pay Mr. Clavier Ankh a little unexpected visit. This is his apartment, isn't it? Uncle Clavier is in the, uh, library. May I ask who's calling? Batman and Robin. Oh, yes. This way, please. Girl from the fur salon. I'm afraid this could be a trap, Batman. He who knows how to fear, Robin, knows how to proceed with safety. A translation from the Latin. Maybe I should have told you, the library is in the cellar. To make this Human Key Duplicator I also made some brilliant changes and innovations. But I'm sure you understand the basic principles, Batman. You are in this vise. A duplicate blank key is in this vise. And when I activate the motor and the vises start turning that cutting blade will do its grooviest work on you. You monster. A grown man like me should be prepared to meet his maker at any time but not a boy like Robin. What diabolical plan do you have for him? First a wax spray job. Somewhat similar to what you get when you have the Batmobile washed. It takes a week or so for the wax to harden properly. Until then, who knows? A notched key for a lock with many wards, hmm? Do I have to watch all this, Joker? The reflection is icky. Oh, not if it makes you squeamish, Cornelia. All right, to the Wax Spray Chamber for the Boy Wonder. Start with a light spray. When every pore in his body is filled with wax, we'll apply a heavier coating. Let's get the skeletonizing process over with, Batman, while you're all keyed up. Have you a last word for posterity? Only this, Joker. Evil sometimes triumphs temporarily, but never conquers. If I have time, Batman, I'll see that that is properly engraved on your tombstone. In the meantime 
NARRATOR". Gotham State Prison, a grim and foreboding edifice. It, like politics, has been the last refuge of many a scoundrel. Including that criminal cowpoke Shame. Now, don't you fret none, Shame, honey. We is gonna get you sprung right quick. I don't understand. We assembled us a gang on the outside and as soon as you show them law men your backside, you're all set for funning again. Well, I appreciate it mighty much, Frontier Fanny and Calamity Jan. But I find this here hoosegow's tighter than a New England banker. I likewise opine it'd take more than a pack of wild horses to get me out of here. You just mosey on by the left wall of this here pokey about 15 past five. And 325 wild horses will meet you. Now you just keep a tight rein, and hold on to your saddle horn, Shame, honey. That kiss is just a down payment on what you're due. Good. Nice timepiece you have there, Shame. Yeah, got it off a railroad man. They gave it to him for 50 years' dedicated service. - What did you give him for it? -Three bullets. In the head. Yeah, you done do'd it, honey. All right, let's point our toe and go. We got 325 wild horses under this here hood. Yeah, I gotta hand it to you, Calamity. You're a woman and a half. If you could just get rid of the other half. Mm-mm. Ah. Excellent fondue, Barbara. Mm. Not often a bachelor gets a good home-cooked meal. Well, it isn't often a spinster gets to cook for a bachelor. Hello. Yes. It's for you, Daddy. Hmm'? Oh. Ahem. Thank you. Commissioner Gordon. What, Chief O'Hara? Oh, yes. I'll take care of it right away. Hold your phone up next to the Batphone, and put me through to you-know-who. What's the matter? Shame, that monstrous maverick of malfeasance has made good his threat to come back. That's the signal for the Bat-answer-phone to be put into action. Yes, commissioner? Dreadful news, Batman. Exactly what's wrong, commissioner? Shame has just fled Gotham City State Prison. Can you meet me in my office? We'll be right there, commissioner. I must beg your forgiveness, Barbara, Bruce, but duty calls. Yes, I think I should run along as well, Barbara. Uh, it wouldn't be proper for the two of us to be here alone in your apartment without a chaperone. But what about my fondue? They were last seen going north on the highway in the stolen tank. Where in the world did they ever get a tank? Madman Otto's Used Tank Lot. Heh. Is he mad now. Yes. We're doing all we can, Mayor Linseed. Oh, that's good news. Thank you, sir, for calling. - They found the tank on West 20th Street. -Is it still there? No, they towed it, the parking meter had run out. They probably removed the fingerprints as well. I think Mayor Linseed should make some changes in his towing policy. Yes, Bonnie. There's something in the outer office for you. Exactly what, Bonnie, we're quite busy, you know. - A horse. -A horse? - Oh. Chief O'Hara, see what it's all about. -Right. Tanks in the street, a horse in my outer office Has the whole world gone batty? Just an expression, Batman. No slight intended. I understand. This is what she meant, commissioner. A saw horse. And there's a note attached to it addressed to Batman. It's from Shame. "I hereby am telling you that I'm a gonna rob the Gotham City Stage at 8:45 tonight. I'm gonna steal a rock and a roll. I dares you to figure it out, Dynamic Dumb-Dumb best regards, your enemy Shame. " It's full of misspellings, and I'm full of misgivings. Holy gall. Hi, everybody. Well, this certainly looks like a gathering of a clan. - Ha, ha. - What's up? Shame is up. To no good. He's had the indecent effrontery to tell us what he's going to steal and where he's going to steal it. Sounds like a very cooperative arch-criminal to me. Why all the consternation? Because none of us can figure out what he's talking about. Perhaps a session with the Batcomputer will aid us in our quest, Robin. We'll be in touch as soon as we figure out this mystifying missive. Let's go, Robin. NARRATOR". A short while later, under the cover of darkness Shame and his cohorts are holed up in Gotham City's Central Park Stables. Ah. Well, that's a mighty fine looking gang you rounded up there, Calamity Jan. Shame, honey, this here's Fernando Ricardo Enrique Dominguez. We calls him "Fred" for short, because it's his initials. Howdy. The pleasure is entirely mine, you may be sure. And this here's Chief Standing Pat. That means: "it's gonna be great working with you, and I hope to get to know you better real soon. " You got all that from one puff? He talks in shorthand. Good. All right, now, here's the nitty-gritty. We're gonna-- We're gonna-- We're gonna knock off the Dynamic Duo. - And Batgirl. -And Batgirl. And then we're gonna do something which I like to refer to as, uh, "The Great Train Robbery. " That's scarcely original, you know. A big mouth is better when it's shut, Fred. So keep your tongue harnessed, and you'll have a thin lip. I stand chastised. Good. Now, you two characters from an old-time Western movie I want you to go out and case the stage, because we're gonna lift the rock and a roll. Now, that's part one of my caper. But we can't get to part two before we've done part one. - Does that make sense to you? -Your lucidity is surpassed only by your remarkable command and penchant for gibberish. Well, thanks, Fred. That's mighty nice of you. We're gonna be good buddies. Now we're gonna meet, rendezvous, at 8:30 savvy? -Savvy. - That means, uh-- -Good. Okay, now you characters get because me and my girl got a little sparking to do. Cheerio. Is there something I can do for you? You can't get closer than two feet until a marriage is arranged. Oh, Ma. Have a heart. A mother can't hardly have a heart where her daughter is concerned. I've got it. What do criminals call a "rock"? Holy carats. A diamond. Exactly, Robin. Now what do they call a "roll"? - It might be a bank roll. -Right again, Robin. But where is the Gotham City Stage? - Yes, commissioner? -Batman, this is Batgirl. I figured out where the Gotham City Stage is but I can't make heads or tails about the "rock" and the "roll. " We obviously need each other, Batgirl. Meet me at the corner of 61st Street and Washington Avenue. - We'll talk then. -Oh, yes. Well, hello, Barbara. To what do I owe the honor of this unexpected, but nevertheless welcome visit? I have two tickets to the opera. I thought you might like to be my date. Oh, I'll have to beg off, darling. There's no time for cultural pursuits with Shame on the loose. Why don't you phone millionaire Bruce Wayne? Daddy, now how would that look? I don't want to appear too eager. No, I understand. 'Bye-bye. -Bye. - Yes, Batman. -May I speak with Batgirl, commissioner? I neglected to ask her which corner we meet on. Batgirl? But you must be mistaken, Batman. She's not here. And as far as I know, she hasn't been here. Thank you, commissioner. How does she do it? A moment ago, I spoke to Batgirl on that Batphone. Now the commissioner tells me she wasn't even there. I don't think we should even attempt to fathom it, Batman. She treasures her own anonymity every bit as much as we treasure ours. Of course. You're right, Robin. Still Well, there's just no time. Let's go, Robin. NARRATOR". As Batman and Robin hurry to their appointment Barbara Gordon transforms herself into Batgirl scourge of Gotham City's underworld and defender of truth and justice. But are their actions too late to stop Shame from robbing the Gotham City Stage of a rock and roll? The answer in one breathless minute. NARRATOR". Gotham City Opera House where a handful of unlikely visitors are already backstage. Yeah. This must be the place, all right. You can't come in here. Says who, short stuff? Well, says me. I'm Pop, the stage doorman. Pop? You ain't old enough to drink pop, far less be called it. Well, I'm 17, and it's a time-honored theatrical tradition that no matter how old or young a stage doorman is, his name has to be "Pop. " Well, good night, Pop. "Good night"? I'm not going to sleep for hours. Wanna bet? I assumed that Shame meant the Gotham City Opera House stage in that The Girl of the Golden West opens. That's a good assumption. I know for a fact that the two leading singers in that production have strange quirks, which Shame probably knew when he talked of a rock and roll. Such as? Leonora Sotto Voce, world's leading soprano who never goes on stage without wearing her 283 karat diamond-pendant. And Fortissimo Fra Diavolo, who always carries $20,000 in cash in his pockets for luck. Let's go. I don't understand it. Every time I begin my aria, you're upstaging me. - Always upstaging me. -It isn't a case of upstaging you, Fortissimo. There are two leading singers in this opera but only one great voice. Mine. All right. Can that palabra, lady. Keep yourself planted to the stage. You too, Caruso. Get the diva's diamond, Fred. Come on. Get these folks' - What are you doing? - Hush up. Shame on you, Shame. Unhand them, you fiend. All right. You. Hey, here comes my women's auxiliary. That's all right, Frontier Fanny. Kissing don't really count when it's through the cloth. How do you like that, Batbrats? What have you done to us, Shame? I gave you a dose of fear gas. - A dose of what? - A dose of fear gas. From now on, you'll be scared of everything, you cowardly caped crusaders. - Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt us. -Oh, spare our lives, kind sir. We'd do the same for you. Honest. Honest. Honest, we would. Yeah. I reckon I would. I ain't all bad. Just boastly. - Stand in front of me, Batgirl. -No! Chief, we'll take the Batgirl. That way the police won't bother us none. Don't worry about them other two. Ain't worth a heck of darn. - Take her, take her. She's yours. - Bring her along. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. How do you like that, scaredy bats? Hey, Fred. Did you hear that? That's pretty good. "Scaredy bats. " Good, good. They took the girl. Not us. Robin. What is this? - What are you trying to do? -it's probably poison. He wants to see us dead. He's always hated us. Yes, he has. You're right, Robin. - You're not to be trusted either, Boy Wonder. -Well, neither are you. Come, come, Master Robin. Really, sir. Alleviate your tensions. This broth is composed of two parts chicken soup and one part bat-antidote powder. -I wonder. It's, uh, to counteract the terrible effects of the fear gas. You need have no trepidation. What's that beeping? I'll take it, sir. - Yes, commissioner? -May I speak with Batman, please? I'm afraid he's indisposed. Well, then give him these messages. The newspapers and the state hierarchy are clamoring for an arrest. And furthermore, in addition to Batgirl being kidnapped my own daughter, Barbara, is nowhere to be found. I'll certainly transmit your message, sir. Yes, Alfred? You best get going, sir. It appears that the mayor and the governor are in a bit of a snit. Feeling better, sir? Yes, but there seems to be a slight residue of fear left. However, I must shunt this aside and press on. - Let's go, Robin. -Uh, where? Hmm, yes, where? We've learned from past experience that Shame is happiest when he's around horses. Now, where would we find horses in the heart of Gotham City? Uh, the Police Riding Academy. No, no, no. Shame wouldn't be that brazen to hide at a police stable. But there is one place he might be. Holy hoof beats, the Gotham Central Park Stables. Across the street from the opera house. Let's go, Robin. Now, here's a plan. Here's our plan. You take this grub-steak out, and buy a acetylene torch and a drill. Why don't we merely purloin those items instead of purchase them? Because it don't pay none, Fred. It don't pay none to risk getting caught over small potatoes. Besides, I need you for the great train-robbery. You sure he's Mexican? You make good squaw. Plenty of meat. And you make good rug. Ah, boy. That old Fanny's a hundred laughs, ain't she? Oh, Shame, honey. Can't you just picture how happy we're gonna be? - Yeah. -You and Ma and me living on our own spread west of Laramie where the air is clear and smog-free and the corn is as high as Chief Standing Pat's eye. Can't you just picture it? I'm picturing about two-thirds of it. All right. Let's see how little old Batchick's doing. - Hello, Batchick. -I think you're caring too much about her. I'm for ventilating her head and leaving her. Just simmer down, woman. Simmer down. She's our insurance policy. Long as she's breathing this Gotham City stuff they pass for air nobody's gonna stampede us. Besides you know, it's you. And only you. And me. And only me. Why couldn't you been born an orphan? Oh. Good. Good. Got the drill? Good. All right. Now let's get. - Shame, honey. -Yeah. - You ain't worried none. -No, I ain't worried. As long as I got that horseshoe up there. That's a sign of good luck. Okay. We're riding high and hog. Let's go. Come on, pussycat. Come on. Get up now. Get up. There doesn't seem to be anyone here. Look. It's Frontier Fanny, Calamity Jan's mother. They're got Batgirl, and we've got Fanny. It hardly seems like a fair trade, does it, Robin? What do we do now, Batman? I wish I knew, Robin. I wish I knew. With Batgirl in the clutches of that frontier felon who knows what disaster awaits her or all of Gotham City. On your feet. - All right. Where did Shame go? -What's he going to do with Batgirl? - Wouldn't you like to know. -Yes, we would like to know. Well, I'll tell you this, dynamic dummies. Do anything to me, and Batgirl's chances of living through the night ain't worth a pitcher of warm tears. I never met a person I didn't like, Frontier Fanny. But in this case, I may have to make an exception. NARRATOR". Have Batman and Robin been hornswoggled? Watch the next episode for the thrilling conclusion. 
NARRATOR". Noon in Gotham City. While millions of workers hurry to their midday meal at a posh private luncheon, the city's by the town's top couturier, Rudi Gernreich. And finally, number 10 is Mrs. Blanche Turer who popularized the mini-muumuu for evening wear. As an extra added fillip, ladies, I have created a new designation. For the best-dressed crime-fightress in Gotham City the first annual Batty is hereby presented to Batgirl. To accept the award for Batgirl are Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara. On behalf of Batgirl, Mayor Linseed, Chief O'Hara the entire Gotham City Police Force and myself, thank you, Mr. Gernreich. This award just goes to prove that there is room for style even in crime-fighting. - Ridiculous. - It's Catwoman. I said, ridiculous. Nonsense. Foolish prattle. How can Batgirl be the best anything when Catwoman is around? No best-dressed list is complete without the addition of the queen of criminals the Princess of Plunder, yours untruly. Right, Manx and Angora? Right. In any comparison between Batgirl and myself she runs a poor third. Just a minute, Catwoman. You can't come here and disrupt a luncheon like this. Or my awards. Ah, but I can, gentlemen. And I have. You ladies with your fancy hairdos, what do you know about beauty? After you suffer the effects of my hair-raising bomb you will never be able to raise your heads in public again. Then we'll see who's the fairest of them all. No, not our hair. Anything but that. I read your mind, commissioner. - To the Batphone. -Right. NARRATOR". In a fashionable midtown men's shop Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson scan the new styles. Gosh, Bruce, my first tux shirt for the first school prom. - I don't know how to tie a bow tie. -I wouldn't be too concerned about that. Alfred and I will give you the benefit of our vast years of experience. How do you like this one here? it's-- Commissioner Gordon's trying to get to us on the Batphone. - We'd better get home. -No, there's no time for that. We'll change into our spare Batoutfits in the limousine and leg it to police headquarters. -Leg it? How about a taxi? Arriving at Commissioner Gordon's office in a taxi might be deemed a trifle ostentatious. But that's three miles from here. A sound mind in a sound body. Thank you, citizen. Batrun. Ruined their hair forever? Catwoman really knows a woman's weak spot. Her last words were something about her intending to become the best-dressed woman in Gotham City. A noble ambition. The problem is, how do we catch her before she creates further havoc? Just as you'd set a thief to catch a thief you might be able to capture Catwoman by using Batgirl as the bait. Never. Oh, I'm sorry to be so abrupt, Miss Gordon. But I wouldn't dream of endangering that fair lady's head. No, you'd better leave the crime-fighting to the men. Commissioner, Chief O'Hara, we'll let you know if we get any clues. Let's go, Robin. NARRATOR". And in an abandoned loft in the heart of Gotham City's garment center Catwoman is fashioning her criminal conspiracy while her admiring henchmen, Angora and Manx, look on. I'm pleased to say everything is going exactly as scheduled. Batgirl is the perfect mouse for my Cat-trap. - Well, you have to catch her first. -Oh, we'll catch her, all right. And as soon as the Troublesome Trio is eliminated we can steal the Golden Fleece. The Golden what? The Golden Fleece. It is the single most valuable piece of clothing in creation. A million dollars' worth of 24-karat gold cloth. All woven into one gorgeous garment, belonging to Queen Bess of Belgravia. I managed to purloin this picture of it today at the couturier's luncheon heh, heh, when no one was looking. I glow at the thought of that garment. Well, how much can we get for it on the open market? There is no open market for it. Then what good is it? We sell it back to Queen Bess. It's a national Belgravian treasure. Her country will pay anything for it. She's due to arrive here today for a series of private audiences in Gotham City. If she returns to Belgravia without it, her people will be up in arms. In other words we are in the catbird seat. Manx take a telegram. "The annual fashion show, also run by Rudi Gernreich in the showroom of Fashionation Magazine. And I'm gonna get away with it. " Signed, "Catwoman. " That's the message, Batman. What an enormous ego she has, telling us her plan. What do we do, Batman? Let us handle it, commissioner. And if you should hear from Batgirl, don't-- Repeat, don't tell her about this turn of events here. Your daughter, Barbara, may have been correct when she said this might be a trap for Batgirl. Right. I won't tell Batgirl a thing. Won't tell Batgirl what, Daddy? Hmm, well I guess I can tell you. After all, you're not Batgirl. NARRATOR". Having learned of Catwoman's plan from Commissioner Gordon Barbara Gordon dons her guise as Batgirl best-dressed crime-fightress in America. While Batgirl hurries to her fateful appointment Batman approaches from another direction. In the showroom of Fashionation Magazine Rudi Gernreich again regales the assemblage with his droll comments. For the rest of this year at least, the fashionable woman will be wearing less than ever before. There is a continuing trend towards mini-dresses mini-gloves and even mini-shoes. Mini-haha. If you'll all remain calm, no one will get hurt. Just why are you doing this? These are all one-of-a-kind clothes, Rudi. I intend to add them to my wardrobe. Let no one say that Catwoman is not the best-dressed woman in the world. There are no fashion shows where you're going. And how could a feline feloness like you also be a fashion model? Ah, ah. Credit where credit is due, Robin. She may be evil but she is attractive. You'll know more about that in a couple of years. Now, are you coming quietly, Catwoman, or must we use force? Your silver-tongued oratorio has convinced me, Batman. I hereby remit myself to your muscular custody. Don't try to pull the wool over our eye slits. Tsk. Now, would I do a thing like that? You cats slip back to the hideout. There's only one ingredient missing in this stew: Batgirl. Look again, Catwoman. How did you find out about this? I specifically asked Commissioner Gordon not to involve you. We can fight our own battles. Catwoman's going into the models' dressing room. - Aah! - Shh! Clam up. If the Dynamic Drips react the way I expect them to react they will not step into this most hallowed and forbidden no-man's land. But Batgirl will. What are we going to do? We can't step into that hallowed and forbidden no-man's land without closing our eyes. And if we close our eyes, we can't see anything. Uh, a sound observation, Robin. You can't go in there, but I can. And with my eyes wide-open. Come out, come out, wherever you are, Catwoman. Right here. She's been in there over a minute. - I hope nothing's gone wrong. -We can't wait any longer. Cover your eyes. Now, let's go in. Close the door, Robin. There are other eyes. Batgirl, are you in here? - Catwoman kidnapped her, Batman. -Holy Robert Louis Stevenson. - Which direction did they go? -Out through the side door. - Thank you. -Oh, no, no. To your left. Oh. Excuse me. Careful, Robin. I think it's a lady. Take my cape. - Ooh. -Ah. May I suggest you take your hands away from your eyes? You're liable to maim yourself. We're fully clothed. What now, Batman? - She's probably got a big head start on us. -Yes. I'm certain it's all part of a plan to kidnap Batgirl. But Why? Do you think she'll kill Batgirl? Or worse, Robin. Or worse. We can't miss, boys. This is the most catacaustic plan in my catalog of crime. It looks all right in theory but how are you gonna keep Batman and Robin from sticking their masks in it? Hmm. Simplicity itself. Look. Here we are on Pussyfoot Road and here is the Belgravian embassy where Batman has been invited by Queen Bess for a private audience at 3:00. So we steal the Golden Fleece there at the precise moment the Turgid Twosome arrive here to rescue their precious ally Batgirl. Oh, you mean they can't be in two places at once. No, Angora, they can't. And no hero worth his salt would let a lady expire. It's foolproof, I tell you. Perfectly foolproof. And you, Catwoman, are an even bigger fool than I thought you were. We who enforce the law would gladly lay down our lives for it. Batman won't be here. He'll be at the Belgravian embassy thwarting your nefarious scheme. Angora gag her. Crime-fightresses should be seen and not heard. There. That's all we'll hear of her nonsense. Manx, set up the pattern cutter. You'd better pray that Batman is a "man" man more than he is a policeman. Angora, get her ready for the grand opening. Yes, my dear. You will make a perfect pinafore. The type of garment no one will recognize you in or as. Heh, heh. If you should pardon a final cutting remark. Ah. So far, all of her crimes seem to have followed a preordained scheme. Have you figured it out, Robin? Well, first she attacked those ladies at that luncheon with a hair-raising bomb. And then she stole all those one-of-a-kind clothes. It would appear she's on an apparel binge of some kind. No doubt. Now, what could she do for a topper? Something connected with clothing that might cap her crimes to date. Holy priceless collection of Etruscan snoods. - Right, Batman? -Wrong. There isn't much call for Etruscan snoods these days, Robin. Besides, Catwoman's mind is more commercial. Speaking of minds, sir, if I may be so bold Uh, be bold, Alfred. It would appear that your mind is not really on the subject you're pursuing. Very observant, Alfred. My mind's on Batgirl. Wherever she is, whatever dire danger she faces. And we have an audience with Queen Bess of Belgravia at exactly 3:00. Yes, another mental aggravation facing us. But can't you postpone it, sir? No, diplomatic protocol forbids it, Alfred. She specifically requested meeting us to discuss the rise in Belgravian misdemeanors. Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara are waiting now to accompany us to-- And to get back to Catwoman. What is it, Batman? Queen Bess of Belgravia has a Golden Fleece she wears for special occasions. No doubt she's brought it with her to Gotham City. It's spun from pure gold, and it's worth a fortune, Robin. But what would Catwoman want with that? It's too hot to handle for any self-respecting fence. But if it were to be stolen from Queen Bess Belgravia would be up a creek without a fleece. They might even declare war on our country. No doubt Queen Bess would mortgage herself to the hilt to get it back. Nobody wants war. Gee, Batman, Belgravia's such a small country. We'd beat them in a few hours. Yes, and then we'd have to support them for years. Come on, Robin. Her Majesty awaits. And just perhaps we'll get some clue as to Batgirl's whereabouts. It's 20 minutes of 3, Batgirl. The next sound you hear will be an automatic pattern cutter with teeth of steel. It will take just 20 minutes to do the work cut out for it. To cut you into a perfect pinafore. And that's why I think Catwoman will be at the Belgravian embassy, commissioner. - A brilliant deduction, Batman. -I couldn't have done better meself. Heh. It's 20 minutes to 3. Time, to coin a phrase, is a-wasting. - Yes, Bonnie. - Hello, baby. This is Catwoman purring in your shell-like ear. You-- You-- You have some nerve calling me here, Catwoman. Just doing my duty as a citizen, commissioner. Helping to save a life. To whom are you referring? None other than Batgirl, the distaff crime-fighter. - Batgirl? -May I have that, commissioner? This is Batman, Catwoman. Oh. Heh. Speak of the angel. Just what are you doing, and to whom are you doing it? You'd better get to 32 Pussyfoot Road, Batman where a steel pattern cutter is just going to work on Batgirl. Great Scott. Be here at 3:00 on the button if you don't want to find Batgirl beside herself. Holy dilemma. If we go to rescue Batgirl, Catwoman escapes with the Golden Fleece. And if we go after Catwoman, Batgirl dies. What--? What are you gonna do? You go to the Belgravian embassy and look for trouble. Yes, Catwoman may be there. You go quickly and we'll join you there. But be wary. You must be on time for the audience or you're liable to incur Queen Bess' renowned and redoubtable royal wrath. Heaven forbid. Come on, chief. I had to get rid of them, Robin, so that we could use the phone. from Wayne Manor. Just pray that Alfred is near the Batphone. - This is one of your sticky wickets, Alfred. -indeed, sir. If she recognizes you as Bruce Wayne's butler, she's liable to analyze the connection and learn Robin's and my secret true identities. But we have to take the chance. Otherwise Batgirl dies. What do you suggest, sir? A disguise. Something as alien as possible to your normal self. But speed is of the essence. NARRATOR". And what of Queen Bess of Belgravia and the glittering Golden Fleece? Is it 3:00 yet? Almost, Your Royal Goodness. -It's two minutes of. -Oh. Well, then we must prepare to meet our guests. - Who are you? -Catwoman. Is she on my list for today's audience? No, Your Royal Goodness. Call my social secretary for an appointment. Sorry, queenie, but I'm antisocial. Oh! Thank you, whoever you are. Think nothing of it, sweetheart. As a matter of fact, it was selfish of me. - Selfish? -Yes. I'm the janitor here. If that machine had sliced you to bits, I'd have to clean up the mess. - You look very familiar to me. -Me? Oh, no. No, I'm the oldest living hippie in this country. You may have heard about my being the first Boy Scout dropout at the turn of a century. Mm. Love. See you around. How very nice of you to come. And tell me where is the much-admired Batman and his youthful companion? I'm afraid Batman may be a few minutes late, Your Highness. Well, it's too bad. If they had been here, they might be able to save your worthless hides. I beg your pardon? Saints preserve us, it's Catwoman. In the adorable fur. Now that Batman and Robin are not here to fight your battles for you let me see how really brave you timorous tabbies are. Get them. It seems we arrived at an opportune moment, Catwoman. Gosh, yes, Batman. Holy crucial moment. Most apt, Boy Blunderer. But the presence of you here indicates that you have forsaken your partner in crime in order to pursue me. Batgirl. Hsss! Not a perfect pinafore, Catwoman. Get them. Crime is a bad habit, Catwoman. Let's go. Warden Crichton awaits. You know what this is, Batman? The Royal Order of the Belgravian Garter. Five decorations. One for each of us. For finding Her Majesty's Golden Fleece and returning it to her. And for finding Her Majesty locked up in a closet off that throne room, she was. And it's a lucky thing that we discovered her too. There are enough international crises running around without us starting one with Belgravia. Yes, Bonnie? I thought you should turn on your television set. A roving live-TV unit has picked up something shocking happening right now in Gotham City. Thank you, Bonnie. Holy homecoming, Egghead and Olga. Queen of the Bessarovian Cossacks. No doubt back to bother, badger and bewilder Gotham City once more. NARRATOR". Egghead, Olga and her Bessarovian Cossacks are back with another assortment of devilish plots. All happening here in our next episode. 
Surf's up at Gotham Point, and all the local surfers are shaping up for the forthcoming world surfing championships. Here's Skip Parker, local surfing idol and the hottest wave jockey around riding out the soup to join his current beach bunny, Barbara Gordon. You really shot that curl, Skip. Oh, I was just lucky. Those combers are really hairy out there. Whoo. NARRATOR". But a fast surf isn't the only thing at Gotham Point that's hairy this morning. Not with this jesting jackstraw, the Joker, on the scene. - Undine. - While in the Hang Five a surfers' hangout run by one-time surfing great, Hot Dog Harrigan - Undine. - Coast is clear, Joker. Hot Dog's working on a surfboard. What are you doing to that surfboard, Hot Dog? Fixing a ding in it. There's a little cavity. It's like being a fiberglass dentist. First you-- Beautiful. Toss him into a trash can, and make sure the lid is closed tight. And, Undine, tell that hot young surfer, Skip Parker he has a hot phone call at the Hang Five. Oh, yeah, you know Skip, there's phone for you in the Hang Five. Your adoring public won't leave you alone. Thanks. Who was that? Some chick who's been hanging around the beach. I think her name's Undine. See you later. Hello? Hello? Take him out to the Jokermobile. Yes, we'll run him into the Ten Toes Surfboard Shop and get all his surfing secrets out of him. Then after I've gotten rid of Batman and Robin for good I will rule the waves. Me, the Joker, king of the surf and all the surfers. Then Gotham City. Later, the world! Skip Parker? Hijacked? By the Joker? From my daughter's description, Batman, I suspect that Clown Prince of Crime is up to some brazen new buffoonery. Don't forget Hot Dog Harrigan. Hot Dog vanished too? We'll rendezvous at the Hang Five at once, commissioner. Robin and I will take the Batcopter to save time. - Alfred, alert the Batcopter port. -At once, sir. - To the Batcave. -Cowabunga. NARRATOR". And so the forces of law and order converge on Gotham Point by air. If we land on the beach, Batman, we might hurt someone. And cause undue attention, old chum. We'll set down in Pelican Cove, just north of Gotham Point and walk down the beach just like ordinary people. NARRATOR". While forces of law and order converge on Gotham Point by seashore. Well, these disguises are a good idea, commissioner but this surfboard's getting heavy. -All in the line of duty, Duke. Duke? Well, most true surfers are known as Duke, Skip, Rabbit, or Buzzy. Ha, ha. All right, Buzzy. You know, I've heard of long-haired musicians, but never green-haired ones. Just a little bit harder I know I should have tried Just a little bit harder I know I should have tried Just a little bit harder I think I'm gonna cry Just a little bit harder I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair Can't find her nowhere Can't find her nowhere Maybe they've got some connection with the Joker. That's a good bet, Duke. Uh, Buzzy, I think this trash can's trying to tell us something. Nonsense, Duke. It's an echo of the surf. NARRATOR". And shortly in the Hang Five Dig the gremmies. Gremmies? No compliment. Beach bums. We should have worn our baggies. May we join you? Drop anchor. I'm Buzzy, this is Duke. Batman and Robin just came in. - What else is new? - Barbara had to go back to the library. But she told me to keep an eye on the girl behind the counter. You mean the one talking to her hot dog? They are sitting with a couple of antique beachcombers who were asking some questions about Hot Dog Harrigan. Oh, thanks, Undine. But forget Hot Dog. The Hooded Hodads are sure to find me, and I'll be ready for them. Hey, what is this? What are you doing to me? Oh, a simple experiment, my boy. Through my latest invention the Surfing Experience and Ability Transferometer all your surfing know-how will be drained out of you and transferred to me. Hook me up, Riptide. Hook me up. And don't forget to switch on the Vigor Reverser. So that all his youthful energy will be pumped into my blood and bones. What's this? From the Batcomputer? A picture of two naked feet? Yes, I thought these new illustrated Batslides might prove a bit of a novelty, sir. Two bare feet. Holy ten toes. Ten toes. A cryptic comment, Robin. The Ten Toes Surfboard Shop has been closed for some time. The most appropriate hideout for Joker and a hostage. Four hostages These Batslides are more than a novelty, Alfred. I've learned more in the past minute from these two naked feet than we learned at Gotham Point in one hour. Although we left Buzzy and Duke out there to follow up. - Buzzy and Duke, sir? -Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara. Everything you ever knew or heard about surfing down cold. Plus your strength, speed and stamina all transferred to me. Ha-ha-ha! You know what this means, boys? The Surfing Championship of Gotham Point in the palm of my pig board. Oh, the prizes, the honor. The envy, respect and adulation of all the local surfers. Where I go, they will follow. What I want, they will provide. And what I want is Gotham City to plunder and to pillage. And that is what they will provide. Sounds good, Joker, but what will we do with this wiped out kid? Toss him in the bin of that work bench and file him away. Funny thing, isn't it? That I know more than you've forgotten. Ha-ha-ha! Put him in there, boys. Put him in there. Joker, Joker. Do you remember those two antique beachcombers I told you about? - Yeah. -Well, I think they're fuzz. And I didn't dare call you again on my hot dog so I came here instead. And I just saw Batman and Robin parking their Batmobile in an alley behind this joint. Oh, exquisite. Their tricks for tracking me down have always been clever. But this time I will outsmart them. They will no doubt come through that window. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you have the poisonous sea urchin spines, boys? - Right here, boss. - Good. Grab a handful, both of you. It won't hurt to needle the Hooded Has-beens a bit. - Ready? -Never ready. Holy pin cushions. Obviously spines from a sea animal of the echinoderm family, Robin. Quite painful. Potentially lethal. But the poison can be counteracted if we immediately soak our bodies in hot water and Epsom salts. Oh! Too bad, Batman. But we've just ran out of hot water and Epsom salts. Ha-ha-ha. Then I think we've almost run out of time. - What deviltry are you up to now, Joker? -Oh, a simple exercise, Batman. In which the two of you will be processed into pre-shaped blanks then fiberglassed, laminated with coats of resin given a high-gloss polish and finally a paraffin rubdown on your top decks. Come, Undine. To Gotham Point and the world surfing championships while Riptide and Wipeout do their work. Holy human surfboards. NARRATOR". Are Batman and Robin being processed into human surfboards? They'll look better with a coat of catalyzed resin. Come on, let's get started. Hey, Batman's foam blank's starting to smoke. Robin's too. It's not only starting to smoke it's starting to explode. - Holy detonation. -Exactly, Robin. Catalyzed resin is a highly combustible mixture. All I had to do is activate this portable ultraviolet Bat-Ray from my Utility Belt to set off the explosion that released us from our foam blank coffins. Let's hit the beach. - Aren't we going after them? -There's no hurry, Robin. They probably stashed Skip Parker around here someplace. Look, the sea urchin spines are gone. Yes, they were no doubt dissolved in that foam along with their lethal poison. -And look again. Sandy footprints leading to that work bench. Yes, let's follow them. - Skip Parker? -Yeah. I'm Batman, this is Robin. Are you all right? A little weak. Some joker drained everything I know about surfing and all my ability out of me. With a gizmo called a Surfing Experience and Ability Transferometer. Plus a Vigor Reverser. The inhuman leech. Let's take him out to Gotham Point and refill him. Gotham Point? Yeah, that's where he bagged me. But I'd like to find Barbara Gordon first. You go ahead. Robin, hop a cab or take the subway to stately Wayne Manor. Take Dick Grayson's car and head for the beach. Batman, in his showdown with Joker, will need the help of Bruce Wayne's youthful ward. Plus his surfboard. NARRATOR". And so the showdown approaches as Batman and Dick Grayson rendezvous at Gotham Point. Leave your board outside the Hang Five and follow me. But play it cool. Ah, yes, the surf at Barracuda Bay has killed many a braver man than I. Why, even the ripples peak at 50 feet. I remember once when I was shooting the curl just as this hot comber was breaking, I cut into the tunnel grabbed the rail and rode into a sideslip. Ha-ha-ha! Aah! Who let him out? Batman. That's what I've been trying to tell you. - Batman? - That's right, Joker. I'm challenging you to the surfing title of the Gotham Point World Championships. It's too late, Batman. The entries are closed. - Correction, sir. -Correction? You dare correct me? You immature mollusk. I'm millionaire Bruce Wayne's youthful ward, Dick Grayson. Mr. Wayne's president of the Gotham Point Surfing Association and in this case I can speak for him. So many of the competitors have dropped out, in awe of your highly touted talents. There'd be no surfing contest without Batman. Good, let's not have one. Just declare me the winner. Sorry, Joker, it isn't that simple. I'm entering Batman in the surfing championships. Shall we go into the men's locker room and put on our baggies? Excuse me, citizens. What do you suppose is up, Buzzy? The surf, Duke. There'll only be one heat for the two contestants. And you'll be judged by the size of your wave, how long you ride it and your style and sportsmanship. - Sportsmanship? -And our fellow surfers will be the judges. Go for you surfboard. Mine's outside. But you have nothing to worry about, Joker. Who's worried? Not me. I've ridden the killers at Barracuda Bay. No, Joker. I've ridden them. Oh! Skip, I've been looking all over for you. Let's go watch the action. Well, into the soup? Why not? It's a shore-break surf. Not too long a paddle to the peak. Here comes the wave of the day. They ought to be able to take off on it. They have. Something sure seems to be pounding in that trash can, Buzzy. Joker's good. What a kick-turn. But watch Batman trimming. Joker's shuffling, Now he's cutting back to meet the curl. He caught it. He's riding the hook. Batman can't beat Joker. But watch him cross the swash. Look, there. A shark! What's that in his hand? The shark's gone. And Joker's starting an island pull-out. Joker's ride's almost over. He's winning. Batman's doing a nose pull-out. I just hope it isn't too late. That shark might have wiped him out on points. I'll check with the judges. Cowabunga! Cowabunga! Ha-ha-ha! I won! Ha-ha-ha! I won! Yes, Batman came in second! The order of finishing isn't what counts, Joker. Why not? Why not? Losers don't come in first. I've tallied all the judges' points. You got one. For being the more colorful surfer. Batman got all the rest including 50 for avoiding a dangerous hazard. A shark. Oh! Big deal. A simple deal. Thanks to the shark repellant Batspray in my Utility Belt. Well, what about my tricks and my technique? You mean tricks and my technique. All transferred to you by that nutty Surfing Experience and Ability Transferometer. Say, something is pounding in this trashcan. Hot Dog Harrigan? It was just a little joke. - Some joke. Kidnapping me. -And dumping me in a trash can. Let's get out of here! Quick! - We can't let them get away. - I'll head them off before they reach the Jokermobile. See if you can find Robin, the Boy Wonder. Ah! The Hang Five. We'll lock them out. Come here, boys! - You're wiped out, Joker. -Yeah. You've hung your last ten toes and Batman's the new king of the surf at Gotham Point. He's all yours, gentlemen. Gentlemen? These two hodads? Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara to you, Joker. Cowabunga. Begorra. Oh, no. Batgirl's not gone again? I just passed her in the ladies' locker room. - Are you all right, Skip? -I will be as soon as they hook me and the Joker up to that Reverserometer and reverse it. - Cowabunga. -Begorra. All's well that ends well. Skip Parker's as good as new. And that Transferometer gizmo only succeeded in transferring Joker back behind bars again. So I think these two crime-fighters better call it a day. Let's call it a week, Batman. - And really get some sleep. -Agreed, old chum. So if you have no further use for us, commissioner Not at the moment, thank heavens. Now run along. Get a well needed and much deserved rest. NARRATOR". But just how much rest do the Dynamic Duo have coming? For what startling new crime wave has already begun across the sea from Gotham City? Who are these two new conspirators? Batman and Robin haven't the foggiest notion but they'll travel 3000 miles to tangle with these treacherous twigs of aristocracy and wind up on the maddest manhunt of all time in that great metropolis of the old world, Londinium. Don't become fogbound. Watch the next episode. Cheerio. 
NARRATOR". We have already seen a department store catalog air-mailed out the window a model of a catamaran sail earthward three little kittens lose their mittens. Gordon suspects the Catwoman. How right he is. Batman and Robin seek to stifle the Cat's meow. The Dynamic Duo calls for help from a newsman. Catwoman is a schoolmarm. But the subjects are sinful. Batman and Robin spring a trap. It backfires. All their plans go out the window. They land in a fishnet. Be prepared. Aunt Harriet swings with the latest dance, the Cat Walk. Bruce and Dick construe the clue. Batman and Robin scout the Sandbox, but one bad turn deserves another. A hotfoot. Catwoman's scorching scheme. In seconds the sun's searing rays will burn their strong true hearts. But hark, the ghastliest goings-on are yet to transpire. What time is it, Robin? What time is it? Who cares what time it is? Judging from the position of the sun in just 16 seconds, we're going to have a respite. How can you tell? Don't you remember? There's an eclipse of the sun due. But that's only for a half-minute. That's all we'll need, Robin, if my calculus is correct. There it is. We've only got one chance, Robin. Do exactly as I say. Right, Batman. Move the magnifying glass precisely 14 degrees to your left. I've calculated the azimuthal equidistant projection of the sun's rays. But be careful, Robin. One degree too little, or too much, and your hand will be reduced to an ash. Ah! That was the closest call we've ever had, Batman. I have to admit, I was scared. I had no fear whatsoever, Robin. - You didn't? -Not a bit. Haven't you noticed how we always manage to escape the vicious ensnarements of our underhanded opponents? - Don't you know why? -Because we're smarter than they are. I prefer to believe it's because our hearts are pure. But just what was it she told us before she left us to die? Something about an assault on Mount Gotham. - Just where is Mount Gotham? -Why, it's it's I don't know. Holy Alps! I'd better brush up on my geography. - It won't do a bit of good in this case, Robin. -It wouldn't? Because there is no Mount Gotham. There's a Mount Sack, a Mount Blank a Mount Gomery, but there is no Mount Gotham. Then what did she mean? There are man-made mountains in Gotham City's concrete jungle. - What's the highest peak? -The Gotham State Building. Rising a magnificent 102 stories above the city's din. What could she be doing at the Gotham State Building? We'll never find out standing here, Robin. To the Batmobile. Uh-Oh. Better put 5 cents in the meter. No policeman's going to give the Batmobile a ticket. No matter, Robin. This money goes toward building better roads. We all must do our part. Good citizenship, you know? Holy taxation. You're right again, Batman. Batman. And Robin, the Boy Wonder. Well, what an auspicious occasion. Please, come into my office. I'll have some soft drinks sent in. There's no time for that, we're here on official business. Are there any special or unusual events here today? Hmm. Nothing that I can think of off-hand. Oh, wait a minute. Yes, there is something. Here, I'll check. This may be it. Yes, yes, we've rented the penthouse for a party late this afternoon. - With whom did you make this transaction? -With Mr. Zubin Zucchini. Zubin Zucchini? He's the eccentric millionaire who cornered the sulfur market in the 1920s. And established the world-famous Ruby Match Company. - Yeah, one and the same. -Come on, Robin, there's no time to lose. Hey, there's the great Zubin Zucchini now. Dressed like that and getting into an armored truck? - Must be some kind of a nut or something. -You should be a kind of nut. He's got 18 million bucks. Give or take a grand or two. Speak. We're outside Zucchini's house. He just flew the coop. Splendid, proceed with plan A. Well, I'm all ready, young man-- Yes, young lady, what is it? Are you Ms. Minerva Mathews, the well-known wealthy recluse? For lack of a better cognomen, yes, I am. Yes. Can I help you, young man? I'm the armored car driver, come to take you to the Gotham State Building, ma'am. Oh, good. Do you have the money? Five hundred thousand dollars, from your Christmas Club account. Oh, good. That Mr. Zucchini just-- Just insists upon cash. He doesn't trust checks since the banks bounced back in 1929. Well you drive very well, Mr? -Staphylococcus. - What? -Ralph Staphylococcus. My friend calls me Ralph. Ralphie, have you had this job long? Four years next July 22nd, ma'am. I'm studying to be an accountant at night. Can't raise three kids on this salary. Oh, you're married. How nice for you. Canary to cat. Canary to cat. Bat has flown the belfry. - Escaped the aluminum reflector. - Curses, foiled again. Tsk. Oh, that's my 11-year-old nephew, Marshall. I gave him this little intercom. We-- He likes to play cops and robbers. He's got a mighty deep voice for an 11-year-old. He matured early. Proceed with plan B, notify all others. - Mr. Zucchini, may I help you carry those, sir? -No, open the door, then get lost. - Yes, sir. I'll just see you to the elevator, sir. -I can find an elevator by myself. You just sign here, Ms. Mathews. Receipt for the money. Just a minute, my good man. Here's a little gratuity to help you along the way. All right, boys, out on the ledge. But it's 102 stories straight down. Well, you've got eight more lives. Out. Did Catwoman just enter this building? - Catwoman? No, no, just a sweet little old lady. -We'll see how sweet. Catwoman's up there. She's about to make off with the bundle, if we let her. But we still don't know what she's stealing. Eight pieces of catgut. - How much could they be worth? -Plenty. They're attached to two Stradivarius violins. Each one is being sold today for a quarter of a million dollars. A half a million in total. Who's buying them? Ms. Minerva Mathews. The well-known and wealthy recluse? For cash. That's your sweet little old lady, Mr. Cramer. So there's a cool million in goods and money for her to purloin, huh? But why here? The 102nd floor of the Gotham State Building is the only place in Gotham City with the proper altitude and humidity to inspect those violins. They haven't been out of their cases in 30 years and might crack in the improper atmosphere. - Look, up there! Are they birds? -Are they planes? No, they're cat burglars. Quickly, to the elevators. Excuse me, citizens. She's put the elevators out of commission. How will she escape? She must have something in her devious mind. The question is, how will we catch her? I'll take me men and we'll run up the 102 flights of stairs. I don't have time for that. The Batjet. Come on. - What are those, Batman? -Batjets, commissioner. I haven't tried them yet, but they shoot out enough power to get one of those elevators up to the penthouse. All right, everybody, back up, back up, back up. Cover your ears. Five, four, three, two, one, lift-off. Seems to be in excellent tune. Ought to be, paying enough for it. There's only $499,000 here. Yeah. I tipped the young driver a thousand dollars for being so sweet. Didn't think you'd mind. Tip him with your own money. It is my money, you old goat. It's my money now. A deal is a deal. You are categorically wrong. - What are you doing? -I'm getting out of these mousey clothes and into the guise of Catwoman. Catwoman? - Now, hand over the cash, Zucchini. -The heck, you say. The heck I says it. Maybe you can bully an aging mogul, but not me, Catwoman. Robin, my little Chickadee, how nice to see you again. You better come quietly, Catwoman. It looks like you've been thwarted. Look again, my effervescent elf. - Ow! - Let's can the gab-athon and throw this rascal out. I might have known you were involved. A person like you can give a bad name to gossip columnists. You'll never get out of here, it's 102 stories straight down. And the police will be waiting for you. - Uhn! -We're not going straight down. We're going straight up, sweetheart. This is our ticket to freedom. You're all right, Jack. Shall we throw the kid over the side? Yeah, it's time to pin the climax of this stanza. NARRATOR". Batman, where are you? Is this the one time you'll be too late? Unhand that boy, and be quick about it, or I'll know the reason why. I thought it was curtains this time. Save your strength, Robin. You'll need it all to help subdue these cats. I think all we have to do now is blast off. You can't get away from Batman that easy. - Easily. -Easily. - Good grammar is essential, Robin. -Thank you, Batman. You're welcome. Now, let's get them. Blast off. Giddyap. Get out. Giddyap. Careful, Robin, it's quite a drop. You contemptible cat burglar. You thieving thugs. Drat, drat, double drat. Giddyap. Get out. Get out of there. Get out. Catwoman's escaped. I don't think so, she knows the place is covered. She must be out on that ledge. Be careful, Catwoman. There's no way out. Come back. I'd rather die. Don't be ridiculous. You've convinced me. Take hold of this Batrope. Secure it about your waist. What do I do with the Stradivari-i? Drop them, they were phonies anyhow. Better let go of the money too. Someone at the bottom will pick it up. Hold on, Catwoman, I'll pull you up. Oops. - Batman? -I'm okay, Robin. Just get us out of here. - Batman, you saved my life. -It was the least I could do. How can I ever combat you again after all you've done for me? Let's hope it never comes to that, Catwoman. Because in the end, veracity and rectitude always triumph. - Batman, are you spoken for? - Mm-hm. Married, engaged, or going steady? My crime fighting leaves me little time for social engagements. Boy, have I got a girl for you. Well, Catwoman, I guess that's goodbye for 10 to 20 years. You've been really swell, Batman. What with testifying against me at the trial and all. You'll never know how much I appreciated that. I have to do my job, Catwoman. - I guess you do. -Don't fret. With good behavior you could be out in seven and a half years. I'll be an old tabby by then. Never fear, there will always be someone waiting for one as beauteous as you. That's the nicest thing you could have said. May I? - I wonder if we've seen the end of her. -I wouldn't hazard a guess, Robin. Why, Batman, are you blushing? It's the The heat of the day, commissioner. - Oh. -Unseasonably warm, don't you think? 
NARRATOR". Ambergris Bay outside Gotham City, where the elite flee the heat. It's a lovely beach house, Bruce. I really haven't used it very much. Now that my youthful ward, Dick Grayson, is growing up he needs a place to entertain his friends. -it's just perfect for that. And I must say I'm honored that you asked me to help chaperone his party. Here come the beachcombers. Better get the hot dogs ready. Bruce, I think we were followed from the beach, but I don't know why. All we did was pick up some old bottles, some driftwood and a bunch of stuff that looks like soaked graham bread. Soaked graham bread? Do you know what this is, Dick? It's ambergris. You mean that stuff given forth by whales from which they make perfume? Mm-hm. Ambergris has a strange fixative quality which allows perfumes to retain their scent. A lump this size should be worth a fortune on the perfume market. Gosh. Let's go back - to see if we can get some more. - Not so fast, junior. Hand over that whale grease. Aren't you gentlemen being a little presumptuous? This is private property. We'll take off, Mac, when we get what we came after. Hand it over. Bring the kid and Mr. Wayne along too. You, Mac, and junior, come along with us. - You can't just barge in-- -This says we can, lady. Come on, get moving. I'll introduce myself later, Mr. Wayne. I'm sorry, sir, but Batman is out of the city for a day or so. No, sir. Master Robin's with him. Heh, no, I'm afraid I wouldn't know how to reach them, sir. What? Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson kidnapped at gunpoint? L-- I-- But-- I'm sorry if I appear a trifle upset, sir but any citizen of Gotham City would be shocked at such appalling news. Oh, this ambergris will help me greatly to convert your priceless lilacs to priceless oil of lilacs, Louie. That's good, honey. Good. But making perfume, even for such an expert as I requires other fixative agents to set the staying powers in the scent. Well, name them, Lotus. Name them. Nothing is going to stop me from cornering the lilac perfume market of Gotham City. And the lilac soap market, Louie. The soap market too. And the lilac cosmetics market. Cosmetics too. What do you need, baby? Well, I need scent pouches of a number of Abyssinian civet cats. All right, sure, sure. The glands of as many muskrats as possible. Muskrats, sure, sure. And a large supply of beaver castor follicles. Sure, sure. And the Tonquin from a herd of musk deer. You heard that, boys. Glands we know about, Louie. But what is follicles and Tonquins? What are you, dumb or something? Don't you understand what she's saying? She's talking about, uh, scent pouches, that's what she's talking about. You guys go and round up the animals, you understand? And when you catch them, put them in the basement. Now, get going. Get going. Move. Mr. Wayne, you're gonna remove those pouches. I hear you're an international sportsman and an authority on animals. How are you doing? Not too well. I'm trying to reach Alfred on my two-way transistor wristwatch. I seem to be getting a slight beep from the receiver, but the sender's dead. What are you two mumbling about? Just passing the time of day, Louie. Let's hope the authorities pass over the million dollars I'm planning to ask for you shortly. That's a high price for two average people. We're all ready, commissioner. What's this? Home movies? We can get no lead whatsoever on the whereabouts of the Caped Crusaders. But we have been able, with some rapid research to put together some filmed coverage of their most outstanding exploits. Maybe we can find out some new crime-fighting techniques from it. - Yeah. -Okay, Jim. Now, first, is where that Western bad man, Shame, cornered them in a cattle stampede. And next is when Robin, the Boy Wonder, was almost eaten alive by a giant clam. And in this one, Mr. Freeze is making them into Frosty Freezes. And here they are chasing King Tut. That's enough, Jim. Not much help, anyway. - Yes, Bonnie. - The director of the Gotham City Zoo -is on your private line, commissioner. - Thank you, Bonnie. Yes, Mr. Buck? Yes, Mr. Buck. All the Abyssinian civet cats, beavers muskrats and musk deer in the zoo are gone? Sorry, but we're as much in the dark as you are regarding this distressing development. We have not been contacted by the kidnappers so I have no idea why they're holding Mr. Wayne and Master Grayson and the police have not been able to reach Batman or Robin. Mrs. Cooper is upstairs in a state of shock and I appeal to you to respect what is left of our privacy. Now, thank you, gentlemen. Good day. Thank you so much. Yes. Ms. Gordon. Your phones have been busy for hours, Alfred, so I decided to come out here. If you'll excuse me. No doubt another concerned inquiry. Yes? Oh, Governor Stonefellow. How very thoughtful of you to call, sir. No. No, we've had no word. No-- Uh, I beg your pardon, sir? What? No. No, of course. Yes. Well, uh, I'll tell Mrs. Cooper, of course. And, uh, thanks for your concern. Ah-ah. Careful. It's a very dusty duster. I thought I heard something bleeping under it. Hmm? Oh, heh. The, uh, friendly ghosts of stately Wayne Manor play occasional tricks on one's ears. The friendly ghosts have certainly provided Mr. Wayne with an impressive personal library. And what a lovely head of Shakespeare. No, don't touch that. I'm sorry, Ms. Gordon but it's a prized possession of my missing employer and, uh, in the distressing circumstances, l Of course, Alfred. I understand. And those distressing circumstances are what I came out here to talk to you about. For reasons too numerous to mention I strongly suspect Louie, the Lilac has kidnapped Mr. Wayne and his youthful ward. Louie, the Lilac? Did you tell your father? No. My father wouldn't take me seriously. After all, he knows nothing of my other identity. But if you hear anything or get any messages, please contact me. It's going to be difficult without Batman or Robin but maybe Batgirl alone can do something. I'll contact you, of course. Thank you, Alfred. I'll see myself to the door. NARRATOR". With Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson kidnapped and held hostage in the defunct fragrance factory while Louie, the Lilac and lovely Lotus plot to pillage and plunder the world of perfume give us a moment to untangle this trickily-tangled skein. The defunct fragrance factory on Lavender Lane? Where did you get that tip, Alfred? An, uh, anonymous informant, miss. I'll check it out at once, and thanks for calling me. Well, Charlie, Batgirl rides again and alone. Who are you? What are you doing here? Oh, I'm sorry, miss. I'm the maintenance man, the new one. I thought you were out, so I took my keys and came up the back way. The people downstairs were complaining about the grinding noise up here. Did you know that this wall revolves? I know the wall revolves. Apparently, it was built to do just that for a previous tenant. Uh, but, sir, you don't have to pry it open. I usually use this door. Where does it go? To a secret closet behind the wall. I use it for extra storage space. Would you like to see it? Well, sure, sure. I'm a sucker for secret closets. - Right this way. -Yes, ma'am. Not much, is it? Nothing for the neighbors to complain about. - I don't know what they're talking about. -Neither do I. And as you say, you never use the revolving door anyway. No, no, of course not. Well, I'm very sorry I surprised you, lady. I really am. And I'll never do it again. Yes. Well, it's not very wise of you. I keep several guns here. And an innocent maintenance man makes a pretty good target sometimes. Oh. Don't you worry, lady. I'll never use my passkey to come in the back way again. Never. And, uh, you can make book on that. Bye, now. Bye. That was a close call, Charlie. NARRATOR". So once again, Barbara Gordon begins her tantalizing transformation. And shortly emerges from her secret exit as Batgirl. Even as the Batmobile arrives in Gotham City during a passing shower without a driver which Alfred is explaining to his abducted employer. I trust you're receiving me, sir, wherever you are. And wherever you are, I believe I've located you. Help is on the way. I'm advising Commissioner Gordon of your whereabouts and I took the liberty of sending in the Batmobile by remote Bat-control in case it can do its bit, sir. Over and out. Hear that? Most of it. Too bad there's no way to get back to him. Now what are you two mumbling about? What's that awful odor? It's all over the place. Saffron and Sassafras must have arrived in the basement with the Abyssinian civet cats, the muskrats and the beavers and the musk deer. We sure did. And you intend to make perfume out of those smelly animals? Oh, no, Louie. Out of their glands. Oh, yes. Which Mr. Wayne is going to remove. Untie our prisoners, gentlemen. Don't bother, Lilac. I have no intention of performing that operation. It's illegal. It's nothing short of criminal mutilation. I'm sure hunger, thirst and exhaustion will help you change your mind about cooperating with me, Mr. Wayne. NARRATOR". Is time running out for Louie, the Lilac as the driverless Batmobile arrives on Lavender Lane? Next, Batgirl. And finally, the police. News travels fast, Batgirl. And apparently, Batman and Robin even faster. Some seventh sense must have told them the dire dilemma facing Gotham City. Right, begorra. And brought them home. If they're inside this defunct factory, perhaps we can help them. Flanagan, the horn. Louie, the Lilac, Police Commissioner Gordon speaking. We have you surrounded. Come out with your hostages with your hands raised. And with that herd of animals you've hijacked. What will we do now, Louie? Just this. I have my own bullhorn right here in my lilac boutonniere. Commissioner Gordon, it's lilac time for you, commissioner. Do you hear me? Lilac time. So vacate this area along with your men at once. One move to interrupt what I have planned will result in the demise of millionaire Bruce Wayne and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson. Batman and Robin can't be inside yet. Perhaps they've gone around back to find a way in. Sure, and it's possible. The Dynamic Duo would never-- What--? What happened to Batgirl? Oh, well, apparently, she's gone to join them. We'll stay right where we are and see what happens. Flanagan, on the alert. Louie, the police haven't left yet. And the Batmobile's out there and that putt-putt of Batgirl's. And Batgirl's in here. No, Batgirl. Get out. Quick. Grab her! Grab her! He's stunned her. With some invisible spray from his lilac boutonniere. Now I have three hostages. And if anyone tries to invade this place, they will die instantly. Lotus, what do you call the process for extracting the scent from blossoms? Maceration. When the flowers are steeped in vats of hot oil. Hot oil, of course. Bar all entrances. Lock the cellarvvay into the basement. When the Dynamic Duo and those dandelions make their appearance they'll be greeted by a unique new fragrance: Cologne de Batgirl. So the minutes tick by and Batgirl is placed in a macerating vat into which Lotus will shortly pump boiling oil. Just a minute, Louie. If you'll spare that brave young girl's life I'll remove the scent pouches from those animals. Sounds like a fair deal. I have your word? You'll let her live? Killing Batgirl was never part of my original plan, Mr. Wayne. What equipment would you need for your operation? I'll need two glasses of warm water. Two glasses of warm water? Yes, warm water plays a major part in newly-perfected animal surgery. Okay. Untie them. Give them two glasses of warm water and lock them in the basement. Batgirl dies anyway. I was hoping you'd say that, Louie. Are you ready? No, not quite. The oil won't flow freely until it's really boiling. There's your two glasses of warm water, Mac. And down there are your pungent patients. Gosh, Bruce. Those muskrats and musk deer are sure musky. - Forget them. There's not much time. -But what are we gonna do with the water? Here, hold them. What are those? The latest invention of Batman. Instant unfolding Bat-costumes complete with utility belts. Drop it in the water. Watch. They're opening up. Like those paper Chinese flowers do when they're dropped in water. Isn't the oil boiling yet? Just starting. I can pump it into the vat in a moment. Holy finishing touches. But now what? That door's bolted on the other side. That window, we use our Bat-hooks and our laser bar cutter. Let's go. What in the world could be happening in there? Maybe he's killed them all. -Including Batman and Robin. -He didn't kill Batman and Robin. We were trying to break in a rear entrance, no luck. We saw enough to believe Batgirl's in danger. If you can loan us your shoulders, we'll break in the front way. Yes, certainly. Right, boys, give them a hand. All right, here we go, boys. Follow me. Right over this way. Here we go. Get them, get them, get them! Tell me something, Batgirl. How did you get out of that vat? With my Batgirl vat opener. After Louie's knockout spray wore off. We'd better get Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. They're in the basement. We'll take care of that, Batgirl. You've had a tough day. You go outside and get Commissioner Gordon in here to pick up this lavender mob. Right. Let's hurry, Robin. All right, men, round them all up here. Take them over there. There's one thing you may not know about lilacs, commissioner. The rarest of them all, genus Louie, may be cut way back but always grows again and never dies. Take him away, Jim. Believe me, we're grateful that you're all still alive. Where are Batman and Robin? Say, that's right. That's odd. Oh, they just kept going. They said they had pressing business. The Batmobile, it's gone. That's right. How did you do it? The sending device in my watch started working again. I was able to tell Alfred to activate the Batmobile's remote controller. The Dynamic Duo may be gone, but that basement is full of Abyssinian civet cats, muskrats, beaver and musk deer. And gosh, do they smell terrible. Well, another canny, colorful crook is in the clink. That tuckered-out police commissioner is gonna breathe much easier on his West Cape cruise. West Cape cruise? I think I've earned myself a little vacation, Bruce. And the department's in good hands with Chief O'Hara at the helm. - When do you leave, commissioner? -End of the week. Why? Uh, it's just that You look as though I were committing some sort of criminal act by taking a vacation. As I was saying, commissioner Gotham City is planning a civic luncheon in your honor next week. My honor? It was supposed to be a surprise. But now the cat's out of the bag. Well, there goes the West Cape cruise. I'm deeply touched. And, uh, just between the four of us, I, uh-- I'll certainly try to act surprised at this, uh, surprise luncheon. NARRATOR". Commissioner Gordon won't have to act surprised at the affair in his honor. He's going to get the surprise of his life from that dauntless champion of women's rights, Ms. Nora Clavicle. He certainly is. Especially when he discovers he's ex-Police Commissioner Gordon. 
Batman So far we have seen a super instant mesmerizing device. A chefs hat snatched. And there goes the chef. A hunting hat grabbed. And it's owner, ditto. And the manager of a silver shop. Holy sombrero! A dish. A jury box. Aha, the thirteenth hat. The Mad Hatter's plans for the Caped Crusader. Another dish. And another snatch. A clue? Who knows? Then Octave Marbot gets it. But something's fishy. Bam. Bash. Crash. A bucket of instant hardening plaster. Is Batman permanently plastered? Wait, the wildest is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman Faster, Marbot, faster. But the cement must be chipped very carefully if you want the mold of the Batman's cowl. Oh, you can take it apart in sections and glue it back together again to form a mold. I will not disfigure my friend, the Batman. Oh, Batman, Batman. He couldn't possibly be alive inside that plaster shroud. Hey, boss. That means he's won't be needing that Batmobile no more. Good thinking. It'll make an excellent getaway car. Go warm it up. The statue, it's coming alive. Apple seed! Impossible. It's diabolical. Curses. My super mesmerizer is on the brink. To the Batmobile. I'll go after them. - After the Mad Hatter. - No, no, Mr. Marbot. It's too dangerous. - Robin. - Batman. Robin. Start her up, Dicer. - Are you alright? - Never better. Well, I'm used to seeing you do the impossible. But getting out of that plaster tomb was impossible. Much easier that it seemed, Robin. I simply held by breath. Holy frog-man! Well, we should help Monsieur Marbot clean up this mess. Oh, no, no, no, Batman. You saved my life also your own. That is enough for one day. Next time you come to pose for me. We start the statue all over again. - Oui? - Oui. The next time I come to pose there won't be any interruptions. Come on, Robin, we have work to do. I find being out-maneuvered by the Mad Hatter somewhat irritating. I know what you mean. There must be some insidious plan. Some overall scheme. Who'd steal five hats and five people with them to gain his nefarious end? And what did he mean, when he said my cowl would be his 13th hat? Did he say that? Yes, when I told him I was on to his masquerade. I have it, How right you are. Then he must be planning to snatch eight more hats and eight more people. Or already has and we don't know about it. Yes, Batman. Commissioner, have you any more reports of hat thefts or vanishing people? As a matter of fact, yes. Word is slowly reaching us that six other fine citizens have disappeared in the last few days. Along with their headwear. I'll get back to you. The police department's on it's toes. Six more kidnappings. Six, plus the five we know about make eleven. Your cowl's the 13th, that leaves-- One to gothe 12th. But why, Robin? What comes in twelve's? Donuts! Um, horse power. Um, amendments. Mile limits? Noon-midnight! Oh, that's not quite it. - Twelve. - A dozen? Shall we activate the bat computer? That sounds like a good idea. Feed it a question about dozens. A dozen, a collection of Ora dozen men and women! A jury, jurors! Of course, Robin, that's what he was after the 12 hats of the jury that convicted him. And the jurors, Madam Magda, the chef, the fire chief they were all on that jury. How could I have been so stupid? Oh no, Batman, you've been pretty busy. One hat left, the key that will hoist our opponent on his own petard! Yes, I-I realize that. Charlie, hold on a second, will you please? Yes, Batman. We maybe on to something important, commissioner. I need the names of the 12 jurors on Mad Hatter's trial. Yes but it may take a little while, I'll call you back. Right. Ahem, I thought I might find you here, sir. Yes, Alfred. It's Mrs. Cooper, sir. Dinner's almost ready and she wondered if you and Master Robin were back from uh. . sighting that fork tailed petrel and black-footed albatross, sir. Tell her we just got back, but we may be taking off again. Oh dear me, how I wish I'd put it, sir? Yes, commissioner. Uh, Batman, I have the jury list here, what did you want to know? I'd like the name of the 12th juror, the last one. The 12th huh? UhTurkey Bowinkle? Oh, he owns the Bowinkle's Bowl-O-Drome. Have you a record of Bowinkle's hat being stolen recently? Or of Bowinkle being stolen? 'No, we have no report of that. ' Good. I'll call you later. Alfred, tell Mrs. Cooper that we called from Slater Sleuth. . 'and that we sighted some night flying birds. ' And tell her we'll be late for dinner. Very good, sir. On second thought, Alfred, tell her, you'll be late for dinner. - 'Me, sir?' - The 12th juror is Bowinkle. Turkey Bowinkle. He owns a bowling alley. - A bowler! - Precisely. What more fitting head piece for the mad hatter to steal. Our job is to get Alfred there before our cunning adversary and use the 12th hat to trap him once and for all. Me, sir? Our cunning antagonist knows we're after him, Alfred. We must do nothing to excite attention. I want you take this, bat-homing transmitter. 'Pay a call on Turkey Bowinkle, at the Bowl-O-Drome. ' 'I want you to place it in his hat before it's snatched. ' That way we'll be able to trace him with a homing receiver in the Batmobile. If I maybe allowed, sir. Roger! Bowinkle? It's just a family name. That's what I thought. You see, I specialize in Genealogy. Ghosts? Family trees. When I ran across your name in the book, I was fascinated. Turkey Bowinkle hmm. 'You doubt if it has a distinguished pedigree?' I got license to run this joint, if that's what you mean? Now, tell me. . perhaps if you have some records of your family lineage. . in your office, hmm? All I got in my office is my hat. Your. . Well. . maybe that could tell me something. It's just a little hat. You never can tell Mr. Bowinkle. What maybe useful in tracing a person's descent. Descent? It ain't no descent to run a bowling alley. I mean, family descent. The natural order of succession from one's ancestors. Or even older forms. Monkeys? Sorry buddy. Turkey ain't no handle handed down from my grandpa. It's a nick name, in the lingo of ten pins. . . . it means three strikes. And Bowinkle meansBowinkle. Now, nevertheless I would like to take a look at that hat. Perhaps the uh, the head size might prove informative. Seven and five eighth's. That put an extra limb on the family elm? That's Bowinkle at the counter with the old guy. Butter him up, find out where the hat is, signal me and keep him occupied. Whatever your say, Jervis. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Bowinkle, I'm from 'Male Modes'. Yeah? It's a magazine, devoted men's fashion. Oh. I'm sure you'll be glad to know you're this week's prize winner. The best headed man in Gotham City. And what is this? Thought that old bowl attracted so much attention before. - And this man here-- - I really must be going. It's been pleasant talking to you. Perhaps we can go into your bloodline some other time. Your bloodline? That sounds icky. Just some cook. Anyway, Mr. Bowinkle. . I hoped you would extend me the courtesy of an interview. Sure, shoot. Where is the prize winning little head piece right now? Right now, I figure it's upstairs on my desk. Waitin'. Not knowin' it's headed for fame and fortune. Thank you. 'Why me lady?' 'There must be lot more with fancy ol' bonnets' 'than an ol' bowler?' Well, how 'Male Modes' selects it's weekly winners is of course our secret. But I suspect your virile charm had something to do with it. Yeah? Well, maybe that virile charm would like to buy you something. What would you like? On the house. Who let you out of the jug? What're you doin' with my hat? That's it, Lisa, get lost. Just repaying old debts, Mr. Bowinkle. It took unanimous vote of that jury to send me up the river. Yeah, well, I'm casting another ballot right now. Do you usually carry a homing bat transmitter in your bowler, Mr. Bowinkle? I don't know how that thing got in there. I think I do. And I think Batman will end up in my hat factory after all. What's Batman got to do with it? So the Mad Hatter gets his 12th juror. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! Imagine, shearing Batman like a rabbit. Or stretching him into any form I wish. Or shrinking him and sizing him. Why, I. . I'll make him into a sun bonnet. Or a ten gallon hat or a fizz. A fizz. . yes a fizz, I'll dye him red. I'll buy myself a camel and go riding off into the desert. Wearing a tribal chieftain's flowing robes. . and Batman on my head. He's flipped his lid. 'What're you mumbling about?' My idle flights of fancy? My little day dreams? Do nothing more than that believe me I'm a very practical man. I already have my 12 jurors' hats and my 12 jurors. All I need now is Batman's cowl. And the caped crusader out of the way. And my job will be complete. Yeah, but when do we eat? 'When I'm paid my fabulous ransom. ' Imagine a vouz. Owning the Gothsonian institution's priceless collection of Presidential head gear. Ooh! I think it's high time the rightful owners of those hats were wearing them. Yeah but the real jury's still out. Turkey's bowler can't be far from here. The hideout must be in this old warehouse. Call, Commissioner Gordon tell him we found the Mad Hatter's lair. It's working, they found us. Just like I planned. It's a long way up. 'You're right. ' Stand clear. They're climbing up the wall. Places, everyone. What a pleasant surprise awaits them. Gosh, Batman, you'd think we were human flies. That's all in the game, Robin. That sure is one way of looking at it. I'm extremely sorry about all these citizens. We meet again, dynamic duo. But I fear for the last time. Your little game of hide and seek is over. - Very clever Mr. Tetch. - Oh, you were the clever one. I might not have been able to lure you here without your homing bat transmitter in Mr. Bowinkle's hat. Holy bowler! And now, caped crusader you will take off your cowl and hand it over. Then you will sit for your photograph for all the world to see. After that I'll take you on a personally conducted tour of my hat factory. I'll have to be dead before you get my cowl. Then, we'll start with the hat factory. Straight ahead please. Turn on the machine, Dicer. You may find that it's smarts a bit to be shown, Batman. Until you lose consciousness, of course. Sorry, I'm late Jervis, but I needed a pedicure. The girl from Antis. Up to her pretty neck in evil. You're just in time. Batman and Robin are about to undergo a treatment I usually reserve for rabbits, musk rats and beavers. Jervis, how droll. 'Do get on with it though. ' 'Then perhaps you can take me out for a bite to eat. ' You heard the lady. Would you like to walk into the factory under your own power or would you like a shot or two to help? Put him on the conveyor belt. Batman! Help! I suppose he's passed the acid test, Robin. That'll keep him out mischief for a while. And what plans do you have for me, Batman? That's up to the courts to decide, young lady. In the meantime, help us find those missing jurors. Whatever you say, I'll show you where they are. I hope we're not too late, Batman. But we had a difficult time findin' this place. Oh, that's alright, gentlemen. I'm happy to report that the treacherous schemes of the Mad Hatter have been knocked completely. . into a hat. Eighty five dollars? Oh, Bruce, it's sweet of you to get me a birthday present. But I hat's a hat. No, Mrs. Cooper, had is not a hat. The hat is a memory. Tea at Gladridge's, Gaundalein, Venice? The hat is a romance, the first time he smiled at you. The night he kissed you. The hat is an experience. Well, when you put it that way I guess $85 isn't too much. I thought you'd agree. It was so nice of you to bring Mrs. Cooper in, Mr. Wayne. But, I'm just sorry I'm a little shorthanded today. My favorite sale girl disappointed me bitterly. She was mixed up with that miserable Jervis Tetch. To put your mind at ease, Madame Magda. I had lunch with the city attorney today. He tells me that the Mad Hatter won't bother you anymore he and his gang are safely behind bars and the judge should give them a stiff sentence. Would you put that on my bill, please? Thank you, Madame Magda. What's wrong, Bruce? It's funny, I. . when I came in here, I could swear I was wearing a hat. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman  
NARRATOR". Night over Gotham City. But what else is over Gotham City? Not flying saucers. I'm sorry, sir, but we know nothing about it at all. I'm sorry, but we have absolutely no information, madam. Yes? I'm sorry, but-- An imminent invasion from outer space? Ha, ha. Well, I rather doubt it, miss. Bonnie, please, hold the rest of the calls. I can't talk to all of Gotham City tonight. Yes, commissioner. But there's a Mrs. Green out here to see you. Regarding a man from Mars she just met in Gotham Park. All right, Bonnie. Wait a minute, then send her in. Now, let me get this straight. You say by week's end, the invasion will be complete. And Gotham City will be overcome, not only by little men from Mars but by virulent living organisms from outer space? You can't expect me to take you seriously, Professor Greenleaf. -I think you should, Ms. Gordon. And I think your father should advise all authorities to submit to and comply with the invaders. Otherwise - What is it? -Look. There. Flying saucers are a myth. A figment of the whole world's imagination. But the world's imagination and particularly Gotham City's, is getting out of hand. What we need is some experienced help. But what's this? NARRATOR". In an abandoned launching pad factory our old nemesis, the Joker, up to a sinister sky-born caper. Joker, you are so marvy! Oh, I was more than marvy while I was in prison, Emerald. I was positively inspired completing these plans for my flying saucer, with the help of my cellmate a mad scientist who had a passing penchant for picking pockets. Plans look great, but what will you use to build your flying saucer out of? Oh, don't worry about that, Shamrock. It'll be made. And shortly, it'll be speeding across the skies of Gotham City. Oh, but not without warning. Ooh, the rumors I've planted. Yes, the whispers are flying. What scuttlebutt is afloat on my private grapevine. And, uh, hmm, just what did this man from Mars say to you in Gotham Park, Mrs. Green? I don't know. I don't speak Martian, or Marsish, or whatever you call it. That's understandable since there is no life on Mars as we know it. There can be no intelligible Marsish language. Did he threaten you in any manner? Not exactly threaten me, but he certainly frightened me. It's not often I run into a It's not often I run into a man 3 feet tall. - No. -Three feet tall? - Holy interplanetary yardstick. -But he did speak to you? And then he left in his flying saucer, Mrs. Green? - He was out of sight in a split second. -Mother Machree. Well, I'm sorry to be so lacking in details, gentlemen but I thought the incident should be reported. Of course, Mrs. Green. It's the duty of every good citizen of Gotham City to report meeting a man from Mars in a public park. Gotham City Penal Code Section 32, Subsection 14. Yes, thank you for coming. You're welcome. Goodbye, sonny. Well, Batman? She seemed composed, intelligent not given to falsehoods or hallucinations. - And vaguely familiar, commissioner. -Oh? Perhaps the Batcomputer can help our lagging memories. Let's go, Robin. Daddy? Daddy. - What's the matter, Ms. Gordon? -I barely got out of the library alive. There was this little green man from Mars, and he was just scampering all over the place. NARRATOR". But the library isn't the only place the little green man is scrambling. And back in the abandoned launching pad factory And scared Commissioner Gordon's daughter half to death in the library? While your sister, Mrs. Green, was equally effective at police headquarters? Oh, thank you, Professor Greenleaf, for a job well done. You'll both certainly earn your greenbacks tonight. All of Gotham City has the flying saucer jitters. And when they see my flying saucer-- How are they gonna see it if you don't start making it? Oh, it can be assembled in a matter of hours, Shamrock. As soon as we get the beryllium. What is that, poopsie? One of the lightest metals in the world, Emerald. Yes, and the Wayne Foundation is currently doing research on a huge supply of it. So we heist this beryllium, build your saucer and off we go? No, Chartreuse. Here we come. From another planet. Terrorizing the inhabitants of Gotham City and forcing them and the rest of the world's population to their knees with the demands I shall issue from my awe-inspiring spaceship. What are those demands going to be, poopsie? Well, what would any green-haired Martian demand, Emerald? Complete capitulation, complete cooperation, complete control. You and Chartreuse hightail it down to the Metals Research Wing of the Wayne Foundation, pick up that precious metal. - Oh, and Emerald. -Yes, poopsie? You go along as a decoy. Create a diversionary tactic just in case millionaire Bruce Wayne or any member of his staff might be there. - Groovypoopsie. -Ha-ha-ha. I'll wait here. If anyone should recognize me at the Wayne Foundation the Dynamic Demagogues might be-- Where have you been, Verdigris? Just spreading little bits of panic here and there, Joker. And I saw the Batmobile parked in front of police headquarters so I planted a little green time bomb under the dashboard, just like you told me to. And set it for midnight, I suppose? We Martians like to dispose of our Earthly enemies at the Witching hour. Set for midnight on the nose, Joker. Mrs. Green. - Greenhorn. -Greenhouse. - Green thumb. Little green men. -From Mars. Of course, I remember now. Mrs. Green used to be the front woman for that bunko artist who, at one time, was blackmailing greengrocers. It's a small world, isn't it, sir? It's a small universe, Alfred. As I suspected, uh, from the beginning, Robin this present Martian invasion is all a hoax. Including, somehow, the little green intruder in the library. Now what, Batman? Well, let's see what this new Current Criminal Activity Bat-Disclosure Unit has to disclose. "Joker at large. Manufacturing a flying saucer. " Gosh, Batman. This machine's almost human. But not quite human enough, Robin. Just what would Joker be using to make his flying saucer? Probably one of the lighter metals. - Titanium, beryllium-- -Titanium. Titanium. The supply of titanium is very limited in this vicinity. But isn't there an abundant supply, sir, of beryllium in the Metals Research Wing of the Wayne Foundation? -Indeed there is. -And Joker's just clever enough to know that. And may be planning to appropriate it. Alfred. - Yes, sir? -There's 15 minutes until midnight. - I know, sir. -Pay a quick and casual call on the Wayne Foundation and check on security there. Robin and I will follow. But I do not want our presence known until and if the Joker plays his hand. At once, sir. You know I find such an assignment quite a challenge. I'll advise Commissioner Gordon. If our suspicions are right, old chum the Joker's terrorizing of Gotham City will be stopped at once. Yes, Batman? The Joker? The Wayne Foundation? And you'll handle it yourself? Well, keep me informed, Batman. I'll send you any help you need. Right. What was that all about, commissioner? Well, Batman has reason to believe the Joker is behind this so-called imminent Martian invasion. He also suspects the next development will take place in the Metals Research Wing of the Wayne Foundation. NARRATOR". So on a night filled with incredible happenings Barbara Gordon makes her own incredible change into Batgirl as the Witching hour arrives in the Batcave. Alfred should be on his way by now. To the Batmobile. What a coup. Ooh, what an incredible coup. Well, a mad scientist to help us assemble my flying saucer. - If I may correct you, sir-- -You may not correct me. I know a mad scientist when I see a mad scientist. - But I-- -Else why were you at the Metals Research Wing of the Wayne Foundation when my men caught you? Along with Batgirl. Caught coming in a window. Maybe we should find her a window in the sky. - You mean, put her in orbit, Joker? -Exactly, Shamrock. Just as we're gonna put my flying saucer in orbit. Yes, with the help of this huge supply of beryllium you heisted. Ha-ha-ha! And all done with no sign of Batman or Robin at all. Hee-hee. Of course, there's no sign of Batman and Robin, Joker. Where have you been this time, Verdigris? Spreading more panic, Joker. Police headquarters is in turmoil. And the Batmobile is gone from where it was last parked. And so are the Caped Cadavers. Gone forever, Joker. Thanks to that green time bomb I planted. Oh, joy of joys. Ecstasy of ecstasies. Do you suppose there's a working launching pad left in this abandoned launching pad factory? Yes, there's one in the launching pad equipment locker. And some fuse. Oh, good. While the countdown begins for Batgirl our mad captive scientist will unpack the beryllium and then help me assemble my flying saucer. NARRATOR". While back in the battered Batcave Batman. Batman. Batman, where are you? Batman? Where are you? Up here, old chum. Boy, I'd say we had ourselves a little blast. I'd say we had ourselves one of Joker's lethal time bombs. No doubt planted by one of his men from Mars. Holy rock garden. Look, the clock didn't break. It's almost 8:30. - We've been out cold over eight hours. -And apparently so has Alfred been out. At the Wayne Foundation. Where Joker and his little green menaces were going to steal the beryllium. Do you suppose Alfred has tried to get in contact with us? Every receiving device around here has been broken. And by all rights, so should we have been. Sure, Batman. If it hadn't been for our Anti-Thermal Bat T-shirts we've been wearing lately. - And look, the explosion even knocked-- -Knocked all the phones off the hooks. Yeah. Hello? Oh, there's no more current, Robin. Quickly, old chum. We must rig up an Auxiliary Circuit Bat-regenerator. Who knows what's happened to the outside world? Who knows what's happened to the Caped Crusaders? I can't seem to locate them anywhere, Mayor Lindseed. Do you expect me to report that to Governor Stonefellow? To the president? Londinium? To the United Nations? This is an emergency, commissioner. Flying saucers and men from Mars don't invade our country every day. Well, at least they've stopped invading for a minute. The sky is as clear as a die. Die? A very poor choice of words, Chief O'Hara. That's what we may all be doing if the Martians return. Dying. If we can't find Batman and Robin. Not to mention Batgirl. NARRATOR". But to mention Batgirl This is a unique experience. I've thrilled many a woman, Batgirl but I never sent one completely in orbit before. You shall have company shortly, though, now that my flying saucer is completed. Yes. We will take off immediately after you do. And we'll wave to you occasionally as we pass you circling the Earth. Of course, you will keep going forever while we will circle the Earth a few more times to give everyone a good look at my saucer as they await my ultimate ultimatum in fear and trembling before I return ruler of the universe. This may be my last attempt to reach you though I've been trying desperately for hours. It works. It's Alfred. ALFRED". The Joker's about to put Batgirl into orbit from the abandoned launching pad factory on Flying Circus Hill. Are you talking to that handkerchief? No, just dabbing my eyes. Stronger men than I have wept at moments like this. Aw. And then he's about to launch his own flying saucer. - Holy known unknown flying objects. -What? Holy known unknown flying objects. Robin, alert the Batcopter port to ready the Batcopter. While I tell Commissioner Gordon that communications have been reestablished. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five four, three, two, one. Blastoff. Ah! The fuse has gone out. That's right, Joker. It's out. The automatic fuse extinguisher in my Batgirl utility belt will forever keep you from putting me into orbit. Oh, untie her. We'll take her with us in the flying saucer. And the mad scientist too. While I push the button that opens the roof of this launching pad factory. I don't understand your language too well, sir but I assume you're trying to tell me the flying saucer is over Petronoviskoff. Oh. Oh, was over Petronoviskoff three seconds ago. Well, thank you, sir, for calling. That was the first minister of the presidium. Barbara. - What? -What? I said, Barbara. My daughter. I wonder what's happened to her in all this excitement. NARRATOR". And well might Commissioner Gordon wonder what's happened to his daughter. Oh. Look, right over there. Just a few billion miles. Saturn. How did you get mixed up in a thing like this, Alfred? My job as millionaire Bruce Wayne's butler sometimes calls for extracurricular duties. But, uh, this is going too far. Activate the Supersonic Decelerating Contra-Rotating Turbines, Verdigris. We're getting a little too close to the sun. NARRATOR". While back on Earth Well, now we've seen New Auckland. Heh. Invert the compression radial ratio. Energize the tandem ailerons, Verdigris, while I turn up this interplanetary Microphone. In 46 and three-eighth seconds, we'll be over Gotham City where I will ultimate my ultimatum. Mi, mi! Yes. Ha, ha. Whoo! It sure beats walking. - Any sightings? -None, but if Alfred's on that flying saucer maybe we can reach him on our Intercosmic Two-Way Thermophone. I hear you, sir. Head straight for Flying Circus Hill. Flying Circus Hill? We're just entering the substratosphere over Gotham City. I managed to put some homing beryl into the beryllium this flying saucer is made of. - It should to head straight back-- -Are you talking to your handkerchief again? Hmm? Ah, heh. Just clearing my head. Altitude, you know. Oh. Heh. Good old Alfred. Yes, I'll head for Flying Circus Hill. You alert Commissioner Gordon. Ha-ha-ha! It's time for my ultimate ultimatum. Hear this. Now hear this. All citizens of Gotham City and the world this is the Joker speaking to you from outer space. From inner outer space. Yes, advising you to-- What's the matter, Verdigris? We've passed the city. We're headed right back to Flying Circus Hill and the abandoned launching pad factory. Oh. Depress the Aerothermo Turret Resojets. Accelerate the Isothermal Oxyacetylene Vaporometers. - Huh? -Step on the gas! This, uh, thingamajig is stuck here. But we're headed right back where we started. Ooh! Ooh! Well, at least it was a soft landing, poopsie. Yes, but on the wrong planet. I wanted to rule the world from Mars. I liked the looks of that place. Yes, I think you'd be more comfortable there at the moment, Joker. All right, boys, round them up. - It looks like you've flown your last saucer. -But I came close, Batman. I came close. Close doesn't count. You'll come much closer to washing tin saucers up at Warden Crichton's cosmic calaboose, Joker. Let's go. Barbara, where have you been? Looking all over for you, Daddy. Bonnie said I might find you in here. I took an unexpected little trip, and, uh, I didn't have time to let you know. Well, at least the Joker's Martian invasion has been grounded. For five to 10 years, I would imagine. Yes, commissioner? Spiffany's Jewelry Store? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What do these window-shoppers look like? NARRATOR". What do they look like? Who could possibly describe Dr. Cassandra and her husband Cabala eyeing the priceless Mope Diamond hungrily and then disappearing? No wonder all of Gotham City is startled as you are bound to be in our next episode. 
NARRATOR". We last left the Dynamic Duo and lovely Venus in a shallow pool where a giant clam had just swallowed Robin. A gruesome joke on the Joker's part. But now, will Venus, or maybe Batman himself provide the clam with its next course? We'll see in short order. It's hopeless, Batman. Hopeless. Robin's being swallowed whole and we'll be next. He isn't being swallowed whole, Venus. I can still see a piece of his boot. Holy human pearls, Batman. Correction, Robin. Pearls come from oysters. You came out of that clam. Ugh! I sure did. But how'd you get me out? He pried the clam open with his bare hands and then he unchained me. How'd you break your chain, Batman? Every man has his own unknown inner strength at a time of crisis, Robin. I'm sure had the situations been reversed, you would've found your strength. But now we must get to the Batcave. But what to do about Venus? I know. I can borrow my friend Bruce Wayne's midtown apartment. Sure, Batman. He hardly ever uses it. Then I'm still part of the team? After what we've all just been through, of course you are, Venus. And I'm sure you can help us track down Joker. Of course, you'll have to stand trial for your earlier misdeeds. As should any citizen who breaks the law, Batman. Where are Uranus and Mars? They should have completed Operation Laundry Bag by now. Maybe they ran into some trouble with the prison guards. They better not. Operation Laundry Bag must be successful in order for me to complete Aquarius and Capricorn. The final two crimes of my zodiac. Ha, ha. They're here. Yeah. Well, where is he? In the bag. - Stupid. Why didn't you let him out? -We didn't have a chance. Warden Crichton's boys chased us all the way from the prison. - We barely managed to ditch them. -Well, quick, help me get him out. Waugh, Waugh, waugh. You dolts. You buffoons. I might have suffocated. - I'm sorry, Pengy. I didn't mean to-- -"Pengy"? Mr. Penguin to you, sir. Numskull, get Penguin's clothes for him. Hurry. Get my clothes for me? I've got them on. Oh, so you do. For a minute I thought those were prison issue. Prisonissue? This sartorial triumph a prison issue? Well, sometime I'll give you the name of my tailor. Sometime I'll give you a piece of my mind. Like right now. I don't have any other clothes for him, Joker. But-- But I got news for you. Saturn called from the other hideout. Venus and the Caped Crusaders are gone. Well, of course they're gone. The clam made a good meal out of them. Ha-ha-ha! The Batmobile's gone too, from outside. The clam could haven't eaten that. Are you trying to tell me Batman, Robin and Venus could all have escaped my clam trap? Yeah, that's the way it looks from here, Joker. Oh, Pengy. Then I really need your help. - To do what? -To terminate Batman once and for all. While I conclude my Zodiac Crimes. Now you're talking. Together to the end, Jokey. Batman's end. Let's try to anticipate his next crime. Which no doubt will concern itself with Aquarius. The water bearer. But what could that be? If you take it literally, of course it could mean the entire Gotham City water system. But he's tried once before. And we foiled him, remember? Yes. With Alfred's help. But maybe this time he's aiming higher. Maybe he has some mad scheme for stealing the entire Gotham City water system. Stealing the entire Gotham City's water system? It's magnificent, Joker. How are you gonna do it? Well, if you make something unusable, it's just as good as stealing it. Well, if you mean polluting the water, that didn't work before. Ah, but this time I have a much more sophisticated plan in mind. Joker-Jelly. Concentrated strawberry gelatin powerful enough to change all the water into strawberry jelly. It's very ingenious, Joker. A crime almost as good as one of mine. One of yours? Those piddly escapades? Ha, ha! "Ha" yourself, you cornball crook. - Why, you waddling little pip-squeak. -You gap-toothed goon. - How dare you? -Agh! - Let me at him. You long-nosed fish eater. -Waugh! - How dare you say--? -Huh? What are we doing? We should be fighting Batman, not each other. You're right. For once. - What's the caper? -Well, my Aquarius crime is all set, Pengy. But I need help with Capricorn, my twelfth and final crime. Capricorn, the goat? What is it? "Who is it?" - I don't know. Batman? -Right. Batman's the goat, and we're going to get him. Wonderful, wonderful. How do we do it? Ah, by using that suave Penguin charm to captivate a beautiful girl. Magnificent, magnificent. - Who is she? Where is she? Where is she? -She's my former associate, Venus. And right now she's in Bruce Wayne's midtown apartment where my satellites traced her by means of a homing device I concealed in her shoe. Oh, I'll sweep her off her feet. I'll charm the stars into her eyes. Women of America, beware. Don Juan Penguin is on the loose. NARRATOR". And so while the Penguin prepares for his romantic task the joker is busy at the Gotham City Reservoir. Oh, this is a delicious spot. Let the Gotham City-ites try to get this stuff out of their spigots. - Yeah. -Just think, Mars. You turn on the faucet and out comes strawberry jelly. Yeah, that's a great idea. You know, if you got a sink full of biscuits. Holy jelly molds. It looks like strawberry jelly. But it tastes like strawberry axle grease. So in his warped way, Joker has stolen the water supply. You think this stuff is coming out of all the faucets in Gotham City? Knowing Joker, I'd bet on it. We'll have to use the Batcopter, Robin. It has the portable Batlab in it. To the Gotham City Reservoir. NARRATOR". And while the Dynamic Duo are rushing to the reservoir Gotham City has gone dry as a bone. Oh, Danny boy The pipes, the-- Mother machree. I'll lay odds the Joker's behind this. We'll try the sulfide reagents first, Robin. We'd better hit it pretty soon, Batman, or there'll be a lot of thirsty Gothamites. Worse than that, Robin, if a fire should break out the fire department would have no way of putting it out. Holy holocaust. I forgot all about that. That'll be the commissioner trying to get us on the Batphone in the portable Batlab. Lucky for us, we had mobile-phone Bat-plugs installed in our utility belts. - Yes, commissioner. -Where are you, Batman? At the reservoir, commissioner. So that's how he did it. Well, we've got more than just that mess on our hands. The Joker sent word to me that he wants $10 million to de-gelatinize the water supply. Don't pay it, commissioner. The Joker's used a very complex formula. It'll take time to analyze it, but we will. Don't you worry about that. That's what I wanted to hear, Batman. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in Bruce Wayne's midtown apartment a lonely Venus receives gifts from an ardent admirer. -It's so sweet of Batman to send me flowers. -Batman? Those are no flowers from a bat-eared buffoon. Those are from a mature admirer. Your suitor. Mm! Oh, you ravishing rose of womanhood. Waugh, waugh. - Oh, Penguin. Oh, uh-- -Mm. I'm going straight now. So whatever you want, it's no go. What? I want absolutely nothing except to pay tribute to your beauty and your charm and your gaiety and your wit. And to that end I have brought you another little token of my admiration. Token! This is a bit of Surplice Number Six, my little tulip. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, this is the most expensive perfume in the whole world. That's right. It costs $1000 an ounce. Tut-tut, that is nothing, my little daffodil. Now put it down and sit on the sofa. Shall we, my fragile orchid, huh? Oh, you're beautiful. You're beautiful, beautiful. Drapes. Oh, heh. Pengy, it's dark. We'll remedy that, my glorious gardenia. Candles. Bring me candles. I, uh, think I'd rather have the drapes open, Pengy. What? When candlelight does so much for your eyes? No. Tell me, my heavenly hyacinth, when is the last time you had a good, uh drink of water? Drink of water? Oh, you can't get any water. Nothing comes out of the faucets but strawberry jelly. I guess that's how rich millionaires live. And you're probably thirsty, eh? Champagne. You'll have some champagne, my little buttercup, won't you? You'll have some champagne, huh? I really don't think that I should, Pengy. Why? You want to die of dehydrophalia? - What's that? -Well, that's the loss of precious bodily fluids due to a lack of liquid in the tissues. - It sounds terrible. -Drink up, my dear. Drink up. Waugh, Waugh, waugh. Some here. Some here. Waugh! Drink it up, my dear. Save yourself from sin. That's it, Robin. Now hand me the special exploding Batarang. Right here, Batman. We'll pour the de-gelatinizing agent into the special exploding Batarang set the timing fuse for three seconds and That did it, Batman. Before I met you, my sprig of mint, I thought of nothing but crime. Now I want to turn over a new leaf. But there's one little problem. - What? -My criminal record locked in the Batcave. And until that is destroyed, I can never feel like an honest man. Why don't you ask Batman to--? Batman? He'd never believe that I've gone straight. No, only you have faith in me, my alluring azalea. Only you can wipe out my past. Help me start anew. - But I can't get into the Batcave. -Of course you can. You ask Batman to take you there, my lovely lady slipper. And then you slip out my card from the Batcomputer and I'll be able to start new. My head's spinning from the champagne. I wish I knew whether to believe you or not, Pengy. Believe me, my sweet honeysuckle. I speak from the heart. I know it's a big thing to ask, Batman but I've always dreamed of seeing the Batcave and Oh, I'm sorry. After all, I guess there is really no reason you should trust me when I was on the other side not very long ago. I trust you, Venus. Then you'll take me? All right, Venus. We'll show you the Batcave. Your decision to lead an honest life was difficult and dangerous. Consider this your reward. Oh, Batman. I'll have to give you a whiff of Bat-gas before we leave, Venus. Bat-gas? Yes. We can permit you see the inside of the Batcave, but not the outside. We can't let you or anyone else know it's location. Then when you're in the Batcave, we'll give you an another whiff. Bat-awake. Completely harmless. Whatever you say, Batman. Oh! It's fabulous. It's a place to hang our cowls. - Well, what's that thing over there? -That's the Batcomputer. And over here is the Bat-spectrograph Criminal Analyzer. And that is our Bat-radar. And over here is the Penguin. And over here is the Joker. Ha-ha-ha! Plus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, Uranus and Saturn. Penguin, you lied to me. Not a bit. I will feel like a new man with Batman and Robin squashed like beetles. Ha-ha-ha! - Why, you-- Stay where you are, unpleasant adolescent. One pull of this trigger and this deadly umbrella gun will fry you to a fritter. It's all my fault, Batman. I thought I was helping Penguin reform. Oh, how could I have been so stupid? He's fooled much shrewder people than you, Venus. But the results are superb, Venus, my flower. With the Dynamic Duo destroyed, the Batcave will be converted into the headquarters for the criminals of Gotham City. Just think of it, Joker. Never again will we be bothered by any all this Bat paraphernalia. Yes, I'm thinking of it, Pengy. I'm thinking of it. Lives of uninterrupted crime. What was that? Merely the Bat-spectrograph Criminal Analyzer, Penguin. Completed just this week. In that brief second, it recorded your bone structure metabolism rate, molecular blood structure, retina patterns and other scientific data that may prove invaluable in the future. But it only works at close range, and is much too large to move. So I had to bring you both in here in order to utilize it. You knew they were in the trunk? No crime fighter worth his salt wouldn't have known, Venus. Well, your Bat-spectro junk heap isn't gonna do you any good where you're going, Batman. Let them have it, Pengy. It doesn't work. No, it doesn't work, Penguin. The negative ion attractor which I placed in the trunk depleted its power source during the time you were inside. - Shall we, Robin? -Let's, Batman. Waugh! Aah! Aah! Waugh! Waugh, waugh, waugh. You caught us, Batman. But your crime-fighting days are over, because we've seen the Batcave. The inside, not the outside, Joker. So what? So we don't know where the Batcave is, you backward eel. Well, why didn't you think of taking a look on the outside, you dolt? Why, you cornball crook. - Why, you whiny little pip-squeak. -You crazy totem pole. Why, you long-nosed-- - You knew what Batman would-- Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough, gentlemen. I think a little whiff of Bat-gas should calm you down nicely. Just breathe normally. Waugh, Waugh, waugh Holy gambles, Batman. What if they had opened the trunk on the way here? They couldn't have, Robin. I have the Emergency Bat-trunk Lock on during the trip. Oh, Batman. I don't know what to say. Well, don't say anything, Venus. After all, you did help us catch Joker. His scheme to use you turned out to be a trap for himself and Penguin. And his slithery stooges. Listen, Bruce. Your horoscope for tomorrow. "Prospects most favorable. The positions of Mercury and Mars which might have been threatening, have changed. And Venus is in the ascendancy. " Oh, my, isn't that nice? That's very nice, Aunt Harriet. And here's yours, Dick. "A very pleasant day. Satellites no longer pose a threat. Fun in store with family. " Oh, I'm just so glad. With all the strange things that have been happening recently. I thought we'd been leading well-ordered lives, Aunt Harriet. Oh, I mean all over Gotham City. All that icky goo in the water supply and the terrible time Batman and Robin have been having. Don't listen to idle rumor, Aunt Harriet. Oh, I know I shouldn't. But someone told me that both the Joker and the Penguin were after Batman and Robin almost got eaten alive by a giant clam. How could one little clam eat a boy his size? It does sound a little farfetched, doesn't it? Dinner is served. About time, Alfred. What are we having? We begin with your favorite, Master Dick. Clam chowder. Clam chowder? Isn't that a coincidence. Chin up, old churn. It's one way of getting even. 
In the previous Bat-adventure we saw a prime minister's exploding cake with a puzzling message from that rascal, The Riddler. The Dynamic Duo. . pinned The Riddler's ears back. But he tricked them. . with a million dollar lawsuit against Batman. Glee for The Riddler. Gloom for Batman. But then, a fresh clue which led Batman into a Batusi trap. Which laid him low. And then Robin got it, in the arm. The Riddler had it made. Gotham City was aghast. Robin seemed utterly doomed. But waitthe worst is yet to come. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Comes the dawn. A bright, shining dawn over stately Wayne Manor. But in the depths of the secret Bat-cave no birds sing. Robin, repeat. Your homing transmitter. . turn it on, boy. - Yes. - It's Mrs. Cooper, sir. She's noticed your beds weren't slept in. She's having a fit. Tell her that Dick and I are spending the night at my uncle's house. That should put her at ease. Very good, sir. I must say, this youth's face makes an excellent impression. You sure are a card, Riddler. Yes, my pretty. In this little game, Iam the ace of trump. Make a positive from instant Compound X then get into your outfit while I bait the Bat-trap. Where am I? Where's. . - Riddler! - 'Mm-hmm. ' You fiend! What's the meaning of this? - Where is Batman? - Hanging. - What? - Hanging by his phone, I hope. Call him, get him through police headquarters on that famous hotline. I wish to pose him another amusing problem. You've flipped your lid. You think I'm gonna help you in some rotten criminal scheme? You're scared. You're really scared that I'll outwit your Batman yet again. Alright. It'll be a cold day in August when we're scared of you! Give me that telephone. - 'Commissioner, this is Robin. ' - Robin? Where are you? We tried the signal. Are you alright? Can you plug me into the hotline? Yes, of course. Hold on. Operator, plug 0-3 into the Bat-line. Trace it. Record it. - Yes. - 'Batman, it's Robin. ' Robin, old chum. Where are you? Ho ho, ha ha. Remember me, old chum? You jolly devil. Harm one hair of that boy's head-- Riddle me twice, Batman. What kind of pins are used in soup? - Terrapins, Batman. - Right. Very good. What was Joan of Arc made of? Joan of Arc was. . Maid of Orleans. That's where you'll find him. Happy hunting. Don't fall for it, Batman. It sounds too easy. I'll get out of this myself the same way I got in. Robin. Robin! 'Robin!' Terrapins. Orleans. Of course. The old turtle mill at Orleans Cove. Riddler, you fiend. Fantastic, pretty lady. Uncanny! Don the belt. Onto the Bat-hunt. Turn on the homing transmitter. Done. Hold on, old fellow. I'm getting you. I don't believe it. It didn't happen. Shut up. Tighten seatbelt. Don crash helmet. He'll give us the Bat-ray any moment now. Perfect. The Bat-ray's conked our ignition. Hold tight. Here we go. Robin. Robin. What's he done to you? I get it. The affected your vocal cords, eh? Take it easy, old fella. Don't try to talk. We'll have you fixed up in no time at all. Don't move. I'll get the universal drug antidote. Reach, Batman. Well, Molly. I was wondering when you'd get around to that. 'What? You mean you saw through my disguise?' A criminal always makes one mistake, Molly. Those straws you gave Robin to breathe through I spotted the defect in the mask instantly. That was the one hole in your plan. Well, there are gonna be some holes in you, Batman. Foolish girl. You were so bent on your murderous scheme you failed to notice. In the BatmobileI burned off your revolver's firing pin 'with a hidden Bat-laser beam. ' Molly. Molly, stop. You're climbing into the Batmobile's nuclear power source. Ah! Help! Help! Stay where you are, Molly. Don't move a muscle. I'll come and get you. Wait, Molly. Molly. Don't panic. Reach, Molly. I can't. I'm-I'm too scared. I'm slipping. Oh, Batman! Poor, deluded girl. If only she'd have let me save her. What a terrible way to go. 'Don't fall for it, Batman. It sounds too easy. ' 'I'll get out of this myself, the same way I got in. ' Hopeless. Broke off before we could make the trace. It's not even a good recording. All those devilish rumbling noises. You're wrong, chief. Those noises are our salvation. What? Those noises? Subway trains, commissioner. Quick, get me a timing on this tape and a complete set of subway schedules. The Batmobile will do the rest. Right. Mother of mercy! What's it doing now? Checking with the main computer in the Bat-cave. Automatic radio link. The answer should be back any second now. Coolidge Square Station. Commissioner, phone ahead. Have them clear the platforms. Right. - Hi, Batman. - Hi. Molly should've been back by now with Batman's scalp. I wonder what went awry? You went awry, Riddler. Years ago. Don't you know that crime never pays. Ha ha ha. Ho ho ho. He he he. Holy smoke. Surrender, you rat. What's that? Holy showcase. A sheet of bulletproof glass. Batman, listen. Don't look so blue. Their final caper is set for tonight. - And I know what it is. - What do you know? I played possum. I heard The Riddler making up some tricky clues. Listen. How many sides is a circle? Answer, two. - Inside and outside. Right? - Right. Here's the second one. What President of the United States wore the biggest hat? It's-it's easy, Batman. - The one with the biggest head. - 'Of course. ' Don't you see what they mean? Biggest head. That's gotta be the famous skyscraper head office of the Gotham City National Bank. The Riddler's gonna go inside and cart the loot outside. Well, well. We've come a long way from the prime minister's exploding cake. Or have we? Nice listening, Robin. Aw, gee, it was nothin', Batman. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's call Commissioner Gordon and wrap this up. And now, even as the fearless minions of the law converge on the head office of the Gotham City National Bank. . miles away, The Riddler and his gang are about to come up under the Moldavian Pavilion at the Gotham City World's Fair. Holy red snapper. Has Batman goofed? But it's so utterly fabulous, Your Excellency. It's simply too much. It's famous mammoth of Moldavia, dear lady. Found in ice many centuries ago. Worshiped by the peoples of my country. Notice priceless jewels in eyes and elsewhere. Beast is stuffed exclusively with used postage stamps from ancient kingdom of Moldavia. Very cheap stuffing then but now, worth unspeakable fortune to stamp collectors. Ah. All hooked up, chief. The air vent to the pavilion. Turn them on. Wait for my signal. Good evening, my friends. One and all. Ha ha. Hello, hello, hello. He-ello. what is that? It appears to be a vulgar, low comedian. Has anybody seen my friend, The Curse? Curse who? Gesundheit. Oh, I see. Curse who? Gesundheit. Oh, that's delightful! Did you hear about Greta Garbo? She dreamed one night she sprinkled six boxes of grass seed in her hair and woke up moaning, "I vant to be a lawn. " I can't bear it, darling. Easy, my friend. That's the signal. Quickly, boys. Quickly. Move quickly. Quick. That it. Move those cups out of the way. Get your cables set. Rig your hoist and bring that mammoth to the hole. Faster, faster, faster. We can't wait all night. 'This joke's on you, Riddler. ' When's a donkey spelled with one letter? When it's 'U. ' A Trojan mammoth. Oh. Thought we were at the bank, huh? The police went there as a ruse. I had your clues wrong but Batman solved them. The biggest head. The fabulous mammoth of Moldavia. With jewels on the outside and priceless postage stamps inside. Get them, boys. Get them or it's curtains. The Riddler, watch him. He's running for the rathole. Back, Batman. Back. If this gas ignites, it'll blow you to kingdom come. You venal viper. Case dismissed, sir? You mean The Riddler's lawsuit against Batman? Precisely, Master Dick. According to the report on the wireless the plaintiff failed to appear. I wonder. Got him, Bruce. The blast of that laughing gas. - It must have got him. - Who knows, Dick? The police never found a body. The Prince of Puzzlers may well have escaped underground to baffle us another day. That meanswe failed? No, Dick. No. Don't say that. The Molehill Mob in jail the mammoth of Moldavia is saved. If it hadn't been for us, the theft of that behemoth could've led to an ugly international incident. When you put it that way, Bruce yes, I see you're right. I have only one regret in the whole affair. One thing that makes me heartsick. Molly? You kinda liked her, didn't you? If only I could've helped her somehow. Weaned her from that tragic alliance with the underworld 'which led to. . ' Dear me, Bruce. I hope you're not speaking of any young lady we know. I mean, the thought of Dick being exposed to any criminal element is. . Rest at ease, Aunt Harriet. The young lady won't trouble us. She's merely someone I pass like a ship in the night. Now vanished like a puff of smoke. Dick. Like some help with that algebra? Sure would, Bruce. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman 
NARRATOR". When last we saw the Dynamic Duo they were in the Penguin's catapult about to be launched over Gotham City and land like a pair of squashed tomatoes with Penguin's cameras set to record their horrible death. We'll be back in 60 seconds with the smashing climax. Holy cliffhangers, Batman. Aren't you even gonna try to get loose? - What's the cube root of pi? -The cube root of pi? At a time like this? Never mind, I just remembered it. What are you doing? We're about to be launched all the way across Gotham City. Exactly, Robin. I'm computing our trajectory. According to my computations, we should land about 30 yards south of the intersection of Mulberry and 7th Streets. And they'll need a blotter to soak up our remains. As you'll recall, Robin I spent last week testing the remote control unit of the Batmobile. - You have that gadget strapped to your wrist? - Fortunately, yes. And we're about to give it the acid test. I've started it. Now to program it to proceed to Mulberry and 7th Streets. Thirty yards south. Hurry, Batman. In a few seconds, we'll be in midair. That's it, Robin. Now, let's hope the Batmobile will get there before we do. Holy suborbit, Batman. It's raining down there. All that time we spent on the remote-control activator really reaped dividends, Robin. I'll say. Remind me to give the Batmobile an extra quart of oil next time we change it. And now we have to get our hands on a certain oily bird. We should see Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara at once. The nerve of that vulture. We'll catapult him right behind bars where he belongs. We'll put him there eventually, Chief O'Hara, but not just yet. Not yet? When he tried to smash the two of you like a pair of ripe tomatoes? Unfortunately, he still has the museum's priceless chain-mail armor made in the 15th century by the great Benvenuto Violini out of a special alloy he also invented. Batman is right, Chief O'Hara. If we put Penguin behind bars now, we'll never see that armor again. - And it could be hidden in a thousand places. -How are we going to find it? I'm not so sure that stealing the armor is Penguin's overall plan, commissioner. It could be just a side caper. I think the first step might be for Robin and me to resume our acting careers. You mean back to "lights, camera, action"? Exactly, Robin. That way we can get a clue as to where Penguin's stashed the armor. Sure and he'll be suspicious, Batman. I hope he is, Chief O'Hara. Suspicion often provides surprises. And so my Caped Canaries, you have survived your little flight through space and now you would like to rejoin my film company, huh? Quack! What do you take me for, a fool? We're willing to forgive and forget, Penguin, and help you finish the film. You don't fool me, Dynamic Double-Talker. There's some hideously honest motive behind all this. You're trying to trick me, huh? Quack! Out of my office, quick. Out. Out. I'm sorry you feel that way, Penguin. If you're not out of my office in 10 seconds, I'll call my bouncers. Then you'll really know how I feel. Out. Move, move. And keep moving, you Cupcake Crusaders. You Dynamic Dingbats. Move! And stay out. This is terrible, Robin. I don't know what I'll do now. - You'll get over it, Batman. -No, I won't old chum. I've been bitten by the bug. - Show biz? -Yes. Yes, it's in my blood now. I wanna get back in front of those cameras. I wanna see my name in lights. "Batman. " Headlines in the movie trade papers. Big premieres. Academy Awards. I'm afraid I've got it bad, Robin baby. The smell of the greasepaint, the roar of the crowd. I'd do anything to get back in front of those cameras. Quack. Oh, the Batman has show business in his blood, huh? A beautiful chance to bake those two pigeons in a Penguin pie. Now, watch things, Mac. I've changed my mind, Batman. I've decided you can act in my film after all. - You'll never know how much I appreciate this. -it's nothing. I was once a struggling young actor myself. Now, he's the second part of the script. Look it over, carefully. - Penguin? -Uh-huh? - I'll never forget this. - I'll say you won't. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in an isolated section of Gotham Central Park Marsha and her aunt Hilda are looking for elderly toads for Aunt Hilda's evil potion. Aunt Hilda, what's wrong with that one? He's too young, dearie. My potion requires a very old toad. How can you tell their age, anyway? There are ways, dearie. There are ways. Well, how long are we going to have to wait? Last time I waited two weeks. Oh, that's just dandy. Have you ever considered knitting, dearie? Wonderful pastime. Perhaps you should try and knit us a few old toads, darling. Great acting job, Batman. You could run for senator. Or governor. Thank you, Robin. Who knows, perhaps I do have a little touch of show business in my blood. Holy history. Penguin's gone from Rome to the Middle Ages. The second part of his script is set in medieval England. It doesn't surprise me, Robin. The criminal mind is characteristically erratic and unstable. And gullible. He fell for that act of yours hook, line and sinker. Needless to say, old chum, I don't like having to resort to such mendacity. But considering the circumstances, I think it was justified. And considering we still don't know his plan. Precisely. Heh, heh, that's right, Batman. You stick with me, I'll make a star out of you. Don't worry, Penguin. I'll stick with you, all right. These suits of armor aren't part of the museum collection, are they? No, Robin, this is quite ordinary armor. - Are we all set? -Ready when you give the word, Pengy. Consider it given. I sure don't like being in this thing. I can hardly move. Nor can I, Robin. But we must make Penguin think we're cooperating. At least until we get some hint as to where he's hidden the museum armor. And this kind of risk is part of our job as crime fighters. Batman and Robin, we're all ready. Come here. It's a magnet, Batman. Try to wrench yourself free, Robin. Don't bother, Batman. That magnet has a 2-ton pull. It'll take a locomotive to wrench you free. You underhanded weasel. Heh. Thanks for the compliment, Boy Bigmouth. All right, men, hoist away. Well, Batman, you said you wanted to stick with me and I arranged to have you stuck. I've also arranged to have you demolished later. But right now I have a little appointment with General MacGruder at the Hexagon. It seems the good general also has a yen to be a movie actor. How would you like to see that priceless armor? Would you like that, huh? All right, front and forward. There you are. My own armored division. Von Pengy's Blitzkrieg. Just wait till I get through with those armchair generals at the Hexagon. All right, men. Forward march. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, quack. One, two, three, quack, quack. Holy catastrophes, Batman. I'd sooner see the Russians in the Hexagon than Penguin. We must stop him, Robin. The Generals at the Hexagon are capable men, but they're trained in open warfare not the devious kind that Penguin practices. See if you can find some kind of loose joint or fitting. We must get out of these things. The Army is always happy to cooperate with the motion-picture industry, Mr. Penguin. Always happy. And the Penguin is always happy to cooperate with the Army, General MacGruder. It's a pleasure, sir. You, uh, did say that there might be a little part in the picture for me, huh? A little part, sir? For a man of your acting ability, there is a colossal part. It is two lines longer than Hamlet, sir. Hamlet? Well Then you do think I have some acting ability, huh? Oh, I think all generals do, sir. I think it's part of their equipment, like, uh Like gills on a fish. - Agreed? -True. Of course, if I may say so, sir, I think you have far more than the average. Ability, sir. Not gills. Ha-ha-ha. I'm glad to hear you say that, Mr. Penguin. You see, I'm due to retire next year, and I-- Next year? Just a moment. Would you turn your head to one side, please? - Huh? -Just turn your head, just a little, to one Oh, oh. Mm. Ah, there. That is magnificent, that profile. Tsk, tsk, tsk. I'm sure, sir, as an Army man you understand the importance of winning battles. Well, in Hollywood, sir, a profile like yours is half the battle. So when you retire, do not sign with anybody else. Because Penguin Productions is prepared to offer you an exclusive five-year contract. - Agreed? -You have my word on it, Mr. Penguin. Very good, sir. And now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get on with my film. I have a very tight shooting schedule, sir. Major Beasley. Yes, sir. MacGRUDER: Mr. Penguin is shooting a very important film. I want you to give him your utmost cooperation. Of course, sir. Now, if you gentlemen have no objection, I'd like to shoot the first scene in Room X. Room X. Oh, but, sir, Room X is right-- - That chin. -What? Did you see that chin, general? That is magnificent. Ah? Ah? It works from either side. Well, now, tell me, what--? - When do you retire, major? -In about five years, sir. Why? I want you to promise me not to sign with any other producer. Because Penguin Productions is willing to offer you an exclusive five-year contract. Oh, my goodness. Well I thought you said you were going to sign me to a five-year contract. Did I say that, general? - Yes. - I must be out of my mind. We want you for a 10-year contract. Now, about Room X. I, uh, ahem think that might be arranged. - Huh, major? -Hmm? - Oh, yes, sir. Of course, sir. I agree, sir. -I knew it. I knew the Army would never let me down. Well, from the way you two gentlemen talked, I thought this room would be full of top secrets. But it looks like a perfectly ordinary room to me. Oh, it's quite ordinary, sir. But Room X connects with Room Y. And Room Y connects with Room Z. And inside Room Z-- - Uh, I think that's enough, major. -Yes, sir. Sorry about that. I'd better get this scene started. Is it all right if I call my finks--? I mean, my crew in now? - Why, certainly. Certainly, Mr. Penguin. -All right, crew, come on in. - Why, I don't understand this, Mr. Penguin. -Sorry, general, that's show business. All right, men, Room Z is the one we want. Through that door. - MacGRUDER: Stop! Stop! - Quack, quack, quack. They're heading for Room Z. Beasley, call the cavalry. Sir, we haven't had any cavalry since 1910. - Oh. Well, call the Army. -Yes-- Sir, we are the Army. Well, get some men up here. Don't just stand there. Yes, sir. Men. Men. Men! Room Z at last. Watch the door, boys. Now find the little item we want and we'll get out of here. Here they are, boys. Remember the Alamo, MacGruder. Remember Custer-- No, no, let's forget Custer. Remember Grant and Lee and Teddy Roosevelt charging up San Juan Hill. That's it. Remember Teddy Roosevelt. Beasley, where are those men? Right here, sir. Come on, men. Hurry. All right, men. This is it. Fix bayonets. Now, we're going to charge up that hill-- Uh, through that door and capture the enemy. All right, men? Charge. Fire if you must, men, but protect your leader. Their chain armor seems to be impervious to our lead. After them, men. Charge! Gosh, Batman, there are no chinks in this armor. No. But I happened to find a loose fastening, Robin. - You mean you can get out of your suit? -No, Robin. But remember, this magnet is powered by electricity. Pfft. What good does that do us? It depends on how good my aim is and whether someone left that empty lamp plugged in. That's an impossible shot, Batman. That's a negative attitude, Robin. Holy bull's-eye, Batman. Beautiful, Batman. You shorted out the fuse box and cut off the power to the magnet. No time to congratulate ourselves, Robin. We must get down to the Hexagon. In these things? We can't waste precious minutes getting out of them. Shoot for their tires. They got away, sir. We have no choice, Beasley. - Call the Air Force. -Yes, sir. Sir. Sir, I think we may have something better than the Air Force. The Dynamic Duo. Thank heavens. What are you doing in those suits of armor, Batman? -It's a long story, major. -Never mind. The Penguin penetrated Room Z and made off with-- With who knows what. Whatever it is, we'll do our best to get it back. They may not be the Air Force, major but they're the closest thing to it in Gotham City. Yes, they are, sir. Should we use the Batzooka, Batman? I don't think we'll need it, Robin. As usual, Penguin has overlooked a vital fact. That truck he's driving is too light to support all that armor. One more high-speed turn, and I'm sure his tires will go. Lucky we have heavy-duties on the Batmobile. You were right, Batman. That last turn flattened one of Penguin's tires. Through the alley, you finks. Take this back to the hideout. I'll hold off the Clanking Crusaders. Now you're in the trash heap where you belong, Dynamic Dodos. What's that mess? Oh, just a pile of old junk. Wait a minute. What'll you charge me to haul that stuff away? - Five bucks. -What do you do with it? Mash it up in a hydraulic press and sell it for scrap. Ha-ha-ha. The Scrapped Crusaders. That's magnificent. - What do you mean by that? -Never mind. Here, here. Here's 5 bucks. I want you to haul that away. Wait a minute. Here's another 5. Mash it down hard, huh? Ha-ha-ha. 
NARRATOR". Another pleasant night steals over Gotham City. And speaking of stealing what unholy alliance is this? The Catwoman and that cunning continental criminal, the Sandman? My record's been clean for months. I'm no longer even on parole. You can't blame me for not trusting you. After all, I haven't been in Gotham City for long. If you didn't think you could trust me, why did you go to the trouble of finding me and asking my advice and help? Good point. Two of my henchmen are waiting in the corridor to put the rest of my somnambulistic scheme to work. Sweet dreams, Sandman. - How did it go, Sandman? -Like a lullaby. She can be of great help to me. What a cat-and-mouse game, Catwoman. We were so fascinatingly feline. Thank you, kittens. Soon J. Pauline Spaghetti's fortune will be in my claws alone. And Sandman will find himself entwined in my cat's cradle forever. And when J. Pauline Spaghetti's fortune is in my hands I'll put Catwoman to sleep forever. I have fed the catfish, Catwoman watered the caterpillar ferns -Mm. and re-made your couch in your favorite cat-skin comforter. -Mm. And now I should pick up some fresh catnip. Mm Fresh catnip at this time of night? - Commissioner Gordon. -This is Policewoman Mooney. Your hunch was right. Meow! Policewoman Mooney! Policewoman Mooney! Something's happened. Just as we suspected, Chief O'Hara. Sandman and Catwoman are in cahoots. In spite of all her promises to go straight. Ha. You know what this could mean to Gotham City? 'Tis an ill wind that blows across this proud borough tonight. I hesitate calling on Batman at this hour, but Especially since no crime has been committed. No crime? My every instinct tells me that a member of our own fine force, Policewoman Mooney, is in dire danger. And who knows what may follow when Gotham City's foremost female felon, Catwoman has aligned herself with Europe's crack criminal, Sandman. I must alert the Caped Crusader for the sake of us all. There it is again. That funny beeping sound from Bruce's study. Uh, no doubt some of his hi-fi equipment needs adjusting. Now, excuse me, madam. Hi-fi? Beeping with Bruce out of the city? I'm sorry to report, sir, but Batman is away on personal business. Oh. Uh, of course. Thank you. He's away on personal business. I'm afraid we've been overlooking something, Chief O'Hara. Batman has a life of his own which we know nothing about. Well, even Batman is entitled to a wee bit of privacy. Oh, if I might make a suggestion. Do. Please do. - The Bat-Signal, commissioner. -Good. NARRATOR". Meanwhile in the back country Bruce, the Bat-Signal. There must be trouble in Gotham City. I sure hope Batman sees it. Yes, so do I. Sack time, fellas. Go down to the creek and brush your teeth. Then come back and hit the old sleeping bags. We better get back to town. How? We can't take these boys out of here on a 20-mile hike this time of night. What's the matter? My ear's ringing. It's probably the altitude. Some altitude. It keeps saying, "To the Batpoles, to the Batpoles, to the Batpoles. " NARRATOR". What do we have here? An advertising stunt? Or maybe something else entirely? Do you really think she's asleep? Or else she's putting on a great act. Good heavens, who's that man? He can't be part of the display. You mean the young lady taken out of that window wasn't even employed by your store? That's right, the girl we hired wasn't supposed to go to sleep on the job until noon today. While no one was watching, this other female managed to get through security and make her way to the bed. Of course, she was asleep in an instant. Those Morpheus Mattresses. Like sleeping on a zephyr. This is no time for a sales pitch, Mr. Smuggly. I'll call you back as soon as we have something to go on. Good thing we don't run this department like he runs that slumber section. Heh. Slumber section, Morpheus Mattresses, sleeping on a zephyr? Mother Machree, we're on the same wavelength. - Sandman? -Can there be any doubt about it? Or that Catwoman is somehow involved? Be careful of that. It's still warm from the last try. Grain by grain, the hen fills her belly, Chief O'Hara. Sir? A pithy proverb about patience. Batman told it to me himself. Alfred, that beeping sound is beginning to disturb me. I'll have another go at the hi-fi, madam. Oh. No, sir. I regret to inform you-- One second. He's here now. I've been sorely tempted to have this device disconnected, sir. I well understand, Alfred. Yes, commissioner? Batman. Batman. L-- I won't waste time telling you how glad I am to have finally reached you. Please don't. Go on. Well, we suspect that canny continental crook, Sandman, is in Gotham City has made contact with Catwoman, and the two of-- Say no more. We'll be there in a matter of minutes, commissioner. About that ringing in your ears Oh, it's louder than ever. - To the Batpoles! -To the Batpoles! Once more, what do we have here? Today's exclusive scoop is Sleeping Beauty. Or rather the young lady who was abducted from the Morpheus Mattress window display this morning and miraculously made her escape and just appeared in our studio here to tell her story. - Catwoman. - No, I'm not here to tell my story. She should get an award for sheer gall. I'm here to tell about the most heavenly sleep I've ever had. Yes. Well, there I was. Your run-of-the-mill customer having just bought this nightgown. When I saw the mattress display in the window, well, I thought I'd catch a cat-- Forty winks. And the next moment, there I was sleeping like a dream. Completely unaware that you were in a store window. Oh, unaware. Thanks to Dr. Somnambula I can sleep anywhere, any time. Dr. Somnambula? I'm sorry, but this is no place for free commercials. I wouldn't do that. Well, you see, I bought all these nightgowns, but I couldn't sleep. Dr. Somnambula cured me. Dr. Somnambula can make anyone sleep. Uh-- Uh-- Let's get back to your abduction. Shall we, ladies and gentlemen? Ha-ha. She's gone. Heh-heh. Of course she's gone. There's a devious and dangerous design here someplace, Chief O'Hara. I'm beginning to think you're right, commissioner. And what audacious arrogance. Where the devil is Batman? But while the Caped Crusaders head for their rendezvous with a diabolical destiny once more, what do we have here in this abandoned mattress factory? You surprised me, Catwoman. I saw the broadcast, you were charmingly convincing. - Except when I almost said "catnap. " Hm? -But you didn't. Your disguise was perfect and it worked like a dream. Now all of Gotham City will have heard of Dr. Somnambula and no one will suspect that I shall be he. Not even J. Pauline Spaghetti. Don't be alarmed. That phone is listed as my office. Pretend you're my nurse. Dr. Somnambula's office. Uh, this is J. Pauline Spaghetti. Hm. I'd like to speak to the doctor. The doctor is quite busy at the moment, Mrs. Spaghetti. There are 80 patients in the office, and the line outside extends around Gotham Park several times. I am only interested in my own problems, nobody else's. I saw that Sleeping Beauty on television today. Uh, I want to know what his fee is for a penthouse call. Penthouse call. Fifty thousand dollars. I will give him a hundred thousand if he's here in 10 minutes. Top floor of the J. Pauline Spaghetti Hotel. I'll give him your message, Mrs. Spaghetti. He'll try to get back to you today. - Did we get the 50? -Hundred thousand. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. What fun I'll have with all those billions of dollars. You'll have, Sandman? We'll have, Catwoman. That's better. I do hope this little caper will attract Batman and Robin. I hope so too. That's where I thought you'd be invaluable. - As a decoy for the Dynamic Duo? -Not exactly a decoy. Between us, we should be able to handle the caped crime-fighters. Perfectly. - That was a quick trip. -Yes. Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara didn't have much to offer. One, a policewoman has vanished. Two, Catwoman and Sandman are apparently in cahoots. Three, a girl was abducted from a store window. Four, she turned up on television. And five, she disappeared. You're right, Batman, it's nothing. Of course, as Commissioner Gordon says, it all could be building up to something. Let's try putting ourselves into Sandman's shoes. What would he be after? Money. Isn't that what we've always heard? Exactly, old chum. And into whose eyes would he scatter his sand to get that money? Someone very rich. And very likely, someone who has trouble sleeping. Or why the pointed plug on television for Dr. Somnambula? Holy alter ego. You think Sandman and Dr. Somnambula are one and the same? I do, Robin. And I also think that ersatz Sleeping Beauty is Catwoman. And it's all some murky masquerade to hoodwink a hapless, sleepless moneybags. Now, can you name some famous insomniacs? Well, there was Olaf the Sad of Norway. He's been dead for 800 years. And that famous Chinese historian, Fu Hop Chung. Born with no eyelids. The French empress whose head stayed awake even after she'd been guillotined? Poor creature. No, no, it must be someone here in Gotham City right now. Let's give the Batcomputer a crack at it. Batman, look! Why? What skinny macaroni. No. It's spaghetti, Robin. A variety of elementary paste larger than vermicelli, but not as tubular as maca-- That's it. Spaghetti. J. Pauline Spaghetti, one of the richest women in the world who made a fortune in noodles and who searched the world over for a solution to her sleeping problems. Is that the J. Pauline Spaghetti who owns the J. Pauline Spaghetti Hotel? One and the same. And she's right here at that hotel in Gotham City now. There isn't a second to waste, Robin. How long have you been suffering from insomnia, Mrs. Spaghetti? Ever since I made my second billion with my secret noodle recipe. Heh-heh. That's very interesting. Oh, about seven years ago, I did doze for a few moments at a rock 'n' roll concert. Since then, nothing. I'm sure I can help you, Mrs. Spaghetti. First of all let's see what the stethoscope tells us. What does the stethoscope tell you about my forehead? Ha-ha-ha. My dear Mrs. Spaghetti. The intransitive roots of your sensory-motor activity are located right here between your paladinious canals and your sinualidated cavities. Wonderful. Are you asleep, Mrs. Spaghetti? Yes, doctor. Where do you keep your financial records? In my dressing table, just like any other woman. Get them for me. Here's my financial journal. Go back to bed again and lie down, Mrs. Spaghetti. Sweet dreams, and let nothing disturb you. "Oil fields: Texas, Oklahoma, Saudi Arabia, Outer Mongolia. Diamond mines: Montana, South Africa, Brazil. Cash deposits: Gotham City National Bank, Gotham City Security Bank Gotham City Continental Bank, Gotham City--" I told you to stay on the terrace in case I ran into trouble. You've run into trouble. A funny-looking jalopy parked in the rear alley a minute ago. Some kind of a hook snagged the terrace railing. And two way-out characters are climbing up the wall on ropes. Real weirdoes. Batman and Robin. Get out of here. By the front way. I'll wrap this up in a jiffy. - What happened? -You've been in the land of Nod Mrs. Spaghetti. Not for long, but it was a start. Oh, wonderful. You are my savior, Dr. Somnambula. Oh, I want you always by my side. I want you to call me J. Pauline. - Batman. Robin. What brings you here? - He did. If he's Dr. Somnambula. Oh, indeed he is. My own beloved Dr. Somnambula. He has just given me the first real sleep I have had in years. We have good reason to believe that Dr. Somnambula is also Sandman, the notorious European criminal. And after your money. That is utterly ridiculous. He may just have stolen something while you were asleep. - Do you keep your valuables here? -Yes. My dressing table drawer. You must keep busy, Batman. Climbing walls and making unfounded accusations. Unfounded? We know you're in cahoots with Catwoman. Catwoman? Who is Catwoman? We'll talk about that later. And if anything's missing-- There is nothing missing. MY jewelry. My financial ledger. Two or 300,000 dollars I keep for pin money. It is all here. - Are you sure? - I am positive. And I refuse to listen to any more nonsense about that medical genius, Dr. Somnambula. He He's gone. Oh. You've driven him away with your stupid charges. I'm sorry. Even before he was paid. I apologize. Oh, how can I ever sleep again? I don't know whether I can help you with that, Mrs. Spaghetti. Perhaps if we left you alone. Yes. Suppose you do that. That door leads to the hall. The hall leads to the elevator. The elevator leads to the street. It's quicker than any Batrope. NARRATOR". Moments later, in the Morpheus Mattress Factory Batman and Robin are back on the Sandman's trail. That was a brainstorm of yours. Checking with Commissioner Gordon about the signs in Sleeping Beauty's window. Our encounter with J. Pauline Spaghetti woke me up a little, old churn. But let's beware and be wary. There is something about this place that seems a little strange. It's nap time for both of you. All right, boys, put him to bed. This machine will button you up forever, Batman. Wonder Boy, or whatever they call you, start the machine. Robin. What have they done to you? I'm sorry we can't remain for the last stitch, but you were right about me and Catwoman. And I promised her a little souvenir of this quilting bee. Robin will fill the bill nicely. Take him. 
So far, we have seen a cat burglar strike. Commissioner Gordon get a gift. 'X' mark the cat. Catwoman bare her claws. Batman and Robin on guard. Robin, get it in the neck. Saved by Batman. "Open Sesame. " "Is this trick necessary?" Sharp tactics. Two mice in a cat-trap. Robin catapulted. The lady or the tiger. 'Cat-tastrophe'. And now, after a moment's cat's paws we'll continue. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na Batman You can't stay there forever, Batman. Your hands will lose their strength. Not while I have a breath left. It's been a long time between bites for Tinker Bell. You should take better care of him, Catwoman. After all, pets are a responsibility. Batman, it's been fun, but all good things must come to an end. And the goodest ending I can think of is yours. It's not ended yet. 'It will soon. ' 'It's a pity I can't stay and watch' but you know how I hate the sight of blood. TTFN. 'And what's that supposed to mean?' "Ta-Ta For Now. " I'm off to pluck Robin's feathers. Calling on his fantastic storehouse of audio engineering knowledge Batman, nimbly reverses the polarity on his communicator. . then increases the audio modulation to about 20,000 decibels knowing full well, it will split the tiger's skull. Don't bother, Robin, you wouldn't know to get out of here even if you get loose. Just you wait, Catwoman. Batman will be here in a minute and you'll be sorry. He'll have to come a long way. We know what you're up to. Is that so? Tell me more. You wanna steal Mark Andrews' collection Well, it just won't work. The place is surrounded by police. Thanks for that information but that doesn't change my plans one bit. You're racing up the wrong alley. Felix, Leo, take Robin down and clip his wings. What now, Cowled Crusader? Is that a "Cul-de-sac"? Did you weigh him? Is that sand ready? All ready, Catwoman. Good, I'll baste him. Purr-fect. To the pit with him. The sand. Catwoman. You are not a nice person. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha You must be curious, Boy Wonder, why this strange feeding method. I'm always interested in the workings of the criminal mind. My pets are orderly beasts and must be fed on time. 'So, when enough sand runs out' Dinner is served. Precious moments lost. There's only one possible way out. Well. . I have personal engagements elsewhere. My untrustworthy aides will take care of the details. Felix, Leo. . I'll meet you two later. 'Right, Catwoman. Farewell, my lovely. 'Give my best to Batman when you see him' at that great scratching post in the sky. As the sands of time run out for the Boy Wonder. . We'll tie him up, Robin then we'll call headquarters and have O'Hara's men come pick 'em up. 'Batman, he's trying to escape. ' Maybe we can still catch him. Better still, Let's investigate this lair. Perhaps, we'll find Catwoman. Yeah, okay, Charlie, okay. Yes? Oh, Boy Wonder, now I just returned from a late session at the mayor's office. Uh, he wants action, fast. - 'Anything I can tell him?' - Yes, commissioner. We've captured one of Catwoman's mob. Chief O'Hara can pick him up at the Gato and Chat warehouse at 2809 West 20th street. Wonderful, but tell me, uh, is there any word on Catwoman? She and her right-hand man Leo made a clean getaway. But, we found the cats in her office. 'That should take some pressure off. ' 'Does Batman have any inkling of Catwoman's whereabouts?' No, sir. Any word from the stake-out at the Andrews' house? Now, I'm in constant contact with them, Boy Wonder. But, uh, there's no sign of Catwoman. Nothing at the Andrews' house. Well. . then the next move is up to us. Tell the commissioner we'll be in touch. Commissioner, we'll be in touch. Over and out and good luck. To all of us. I don't understand why Catwoman would leave these behind. Especially, after going to such great lengths to steal them. Perhaps, she had another use for them. We'll find out when we examine. Besides, she really didn't leave them behind. She probably, expected to return. They've got to be the answer. Well, we've tried everything. The Metal Analyzer, the Spectroscope. . both negative. No hidden compartments. I just don't understand it. Look at the back of this cat, Robin, what do you see? Just some funny markings. Why? Look at the other one. Wellsome different markings. These cats are supposed to be identical. Wait a moment. Something just occurred to me. There's an obscure legend. These cats once belonged to the notorious pirate Captain Manx. Isn't he the pirate who willed his treasure to the underprivileged children of Gotham City? As a sort of repayment for all the havoc he wreaked on the city's ships when it was first founded? The unique thing about the legend is that they never recovered one gold doubloon. Holy felony. Do you think Catwoman stumbled on to this? We'll know as soon as I find the information here in the second volume of 'The History of Gotham City'. What happened? Where's Felix? It's a long story. Well, I don't have time for long stories. Where are the cats? You did save the cats, didn't you? Batman got 'em. Batman got them! Well, that does it. That's another fine mess you got us into, Leo. Alright. Let's hit up the Batman reception. Now that Batman has got the cats he's bound to figure out their secret. Put alternate Plan B into effect. Great Scott, I found it. It's just as I remembered it. Look here, Robin. This is the shape of Gotham city in those days. Since then, a lot more land has been added. But does this pattern look familiar to you. Holy geography, of course! That's the same markings we found when you put the two cats together. Holy geography, indeed, Robin. Without each other, these two cats are useless. But when put together, they form a map that will lead us right to the hidden treasure chest of Pirate Captain Manx himself. Gosh, Batman! 'Now the question is' Where is Catwoman? Hmm. Look, Catwoman still had these cats in her possession. We'd have no trouble finding her. That radioactive spray we used still shows up. Yes, you are absolutely correct. Don't hold that cat so close to your face. 'Some of the radioactive spray may rub off on you. ' Right, I should have thought of that myself. Batman. 'Yes, Robin. ' If someone were to hold these cats close enough and long enough. Do you suppose, some of the radioactivity might show up on the person? Yes, quite possibly. Well, Catwoman was holding the cats. And. . And we switch on the Bat-o-meter. Batman! The Bat-o-meter's going crazy. Of course, the cats are disturbing the calibration. Better put them in the lead shielding compartment. There, there Batman! 'There's the blip. ' 'She's out on McGilroy. . ' There's only one road leading into that area. And if the Catwoman knows we are coming, she'll be ready for us. Better use the Bat-armor. Let's go! - 'Did you get the road mine?' - Yes, ma'am. Good. I've got the spot in the cave marked. Get the tools. At last. . the plunder of a dozen galleys. Diamonds, rubies, emeralds. Never again to face deprivation. From now on, pussy will ooze galore. I'm rich! We are rich, Catwoman. How? They thought we were after the Mark Andrew's collection. They thought they were dealing with an ordinary cat burglar. Here. 'Fill this up. ' 'That chest is so clumsy. ' And now there's just two of us left to share it. Yeah. Justtwo of us. Just as I thought, she has mined the road with explosives. No wonder, you had me put on the Bat-armor. Gosh! You really think of everything, Batman. What's that? Although the Bat-armor protected our car. Those land mines blew our tires. Robin, turn on the automatic tire repair device. She's within a hundred feet of here. 'Yeah, but where?' What about those footprints. Only one man has feet that big. There must be an opening somewhere near here. Boy, I wonder what my end's gonna be? Argh. This. There's never enough for two. Stay right where you are, Catwoman. Don't! Don't do it, Catwoman. You'll never make that jump with what you're carrying. Just watch me, Batman. - Batman! - Help me. Hang on, Catwoman. When I thrown the Bat-rope, reach out and catch it. I'm afraid. Let go of the bag, Catwoman. Then you'll be able to catch the rope with your free hand. I can't let go of it. Drop it, Catwoman. Otherwise you'll fall into that bottomless pit. Nothing's worth that. I can't let go. I can't! Catwoman! Can you hear me? Catwoman! It's no use, Robin. She probably went straight to the bottom. Why didn't she let go of the bag? Didn't she know, what would happen? Greed is an overpowering emotion, Robin. It sometimes dims all the senses even that of self-preservation. I suppose in the end that's what trips up all criminals. You think she might still be alive? A cat is supposed to have nine lives. It's hard to say. Bishop. Queen six. Third level. This will take a minute, Bruce. I didn't figure on that move at all. Uh. Begging your pardon, Master Dick. But ah. . A knight takes bishop play. Might seem in order here. Thank you, Alfred. Ah, in that case. Queen takes knight and checkmate. 'I said no, you devil!' Oh, honestly. . - 'I couldn't have--' - 'What's wrong, Aunt Harriet?' It's this infernal cat. The little heathen stole the lobster I was preparing for your dinner. This cat is a thief. And we are doing our best to rehabilitate. Well, it steals everything it can it's paws on. 'You have to understand, Aunt Harriet. ' The cat comes from a broken home. Master Dick. Next week, "The Return of the Penguin.

NARRATOR". A typically beautiful day in Gotham City. But the return of a dastardly duo and their deadly dragoons. . . bodes darkening clouds. - Let me help you cross, ma'am. -Why thank you, sonny. - Look out, ma'am! -Oh! Oh! I can't believe my eyes, sonny. That looks like a band of Cossacks. Yes, ma'am, it does. Olga, Olga, wait for me. Wait for me, Olga. I do believe that's Egghead, the notorious arch-criminal. But why is he riding that burro? What are those Cossacks doing in Gotham City? NARRATOR". Good questions, indeed. And the ominous answers are not far away. At the Gotham City Museum - Wait a minute, what's going on here? -Oh, is nothing going on, my little piroshki. Nothing to worry your head about. Come back here, you. You can't do this. Is there Silver Scimitar of Taras Bulbul. Never to be pulled out except by rightful heir to throne of Bessarovian Cossacks. By me, Queen Olga legitimate ruler of Bessarovian Cossacks. You'll never get away with this, you scoundrel! Shh. This is a museum. Quiet, please. Olga? Olga, you could at least give me a horse. I can't keep up with you. I'm eggs-hausted. Only Bessarovian Cossacks are riding horses, darling. All others are having burros. All right, all right. As long as you remember our bargain. I am remembering, darling. Silver Scimitar for me golden egg for you. -Heh, heh. Imperial queen is ready. Is done. I, Olga, am possessor of Silver Scimitar of Taras Bulbul. And I, Egghead, am possessor of the solid gold egg. Unh! Now let's get out of here fast before the Gotham City cops arrive. Oh, do not worry about cops, darling. My Cossacks are making cops-burgers from them if they buttinsky. Fine, fine, but let's get out of here anyway. The Egg of Ogg and the Bulbul Scimitar? We'll get on it at once. The Bulbul Scimitar? The Egg of Ogg? That's right, Chief O'Hara. A frightening theft from the Gotham City Museum. But what makes it even more frightening is who perpetrated it. From all descriptions apparently Olga, Egghead, and that band of Bessarovian Cossacks. Begorra. I thought Egghead was behind bars and the Bessarovians had been sent back to Bessarovia. Bessarovia didn't want the Bessarovians. And Egghead's out on a legal technicality. There's only one person who can help us. Batman. Oh, but I can hardly bring myself to call him again. - Want me to call him? -No, no, no. Wait, wait. Give me a moment to summon my strength and courage. For if ever strength and courage were needed in Gotham City, Chief O'Hara it's needed now. Gosh, Bruce, that Genghis Khan was quite a guy. In the 13th century, he and his Mongol armies almost conquered Europe. Yes, Dick, the Mongols are fierce warriors. Even today you can find pockets of them scattered throughout Asia. - I'll get it, sir. - Thank you. One moment, commissioner. Excuse me, sir, but Commissioner Gordon wishes to speak to you about certain pockets of criminal activity in Gotham City. Thank you, Alfred. Yes, commissioner? The Bulbul Scimitar and the Egg of Ogg? I see. We'll be right down. To the Batpoles. There's no doubt it was Egghead, Olga, and the Cossacks? - None. -Galloping through the streets they were too. My department's had a dozen calls reporting a band of horsemen on the loose again. - Holy Tartars. -Unholy Tartars, Robin. Stealing scimitars and golden eggs from a museum is one thing but when the average citizen on the street is in peril, something must be done and quickly. Like rounding the interlopers up and shipping them out. Ha, ha. That's just it. Nobody wants them. Still, they have no diplomatic immunity from the laws of this city, this state and this country. Gosh, no, and Egghead doesn't either. He's a very stupid man, compounding all his felonies. Women like Olga have been the downfall of far wiser men than Egghead, commissioner. No, the invasion was just the beginning of the new nefarious plan of pilfer and plunder involving, no doubt, more egg targets of some kind. We'll make a list of every egg target left in Gotham City, Batman. NARRATOR". But while the dynamic duo are organizing their defense ALL". Hey, hey, hey! Oh, must they make so much noise, Olga? I can't hear myself think. It is victory celebration, Eggski. Cossack without victory dance is like egg without salt. Well, that hits me where I live. Heh, heh. Well, let them dance. There'll be bigger victories than this, and soon eggs-quisite victories. Heh, heh. - You have plans, Eggski? -Big plans, Olga, big plans. The Scimitar of Taras Bulbul, the golden Egg of Ogg are only the beginning of a series of dastardly plans that will leave Gotham City begging for mercy. Mercy! Ha! - My Cossacks are not giving mercy. -No, of course not. Mm. You lovely, evil woman, not a drop of mercy. Heh,heh,heh. You are heartless, hairless man. I'm liking you more and more. Oh, and I you, Olga. I, you. Our meeting was destiny. - And after we're married, Olga, we-- -Ah. Hold horses, Eggski. I told you before, no marriage without dowry. But why do you think I'm planning all of these crimes for us, Olga? No, the loot will be your dowry and then we can be properly married. I must have big dowry. - Dowry fit for queen, imperatritsa. -And you will, Olga. You will, yes. Yes, the series of crimes that I am planning will net you the largest dowry in history. What is next crime? We're heisting a certain vault full of dehydrated roe. Row? As in boat? No, no. Roe as in fish egg. And fish egg as in caviar. And caviar as in a certain special cold-storage vault at the Gotham City bank. Yes, a shipment of 500 pounds. It was a gift from the czar of Samarqand to the people of Gotham City. And it's worth $200 an ounce. You won't have lunch with me, Daddy? I only wish I could, darling, but Gotham City is in too much danger right now for the police commissioner to take a leisurely lunch much as I'd like to. -Danger? Incredible as it sounds, there is a band of Bessarovian Cossacks loose in Gotham City. -You mean again? They're back? That's incredible. But true, sad to say. If the dynamic duo weren't helping us, I don't know what I'd do. This is just between you and me, of course. Now, I don't want it to spread, or there might be panic in the streets. Don't worry. I only wish there was something I could do to help. There is something you can do. You can help by going straight home and staying out of trouble. Okay. I'll go straight home. But this is no time for me to stay out of trouble or off the streets. Right, Charlie? However, I will change clothes before I go out again. Come on, keep me company. But you mustn't tell anyone what you see in here. NARRATOR". As Barbara Gordon makes her astonishing change into Batgirl and heads out on her own to prevent panic in the streets the Caped Crusaders are not idle. "The Lo Hung Company, makers of egg drop soup Canes Candy Company, manufacturers of chocolate Easter eggs. " Well, that's the last of them, Robin. We've alerted every company in Gotham City that's even remotely connected with eggs. You think Olga and Egghead might be planning some crime not connected with eggs? I doubt it, Robin. Like all criminals, Egghead follows a particular predictable pattern. But although we know the pattern, we don't know the particular crime. We also don't know what part Olga and her Cossacks will play. Quite true, Robin. And I've been racking my brains trying to-- Wait a minute. What country is located next to Bessarovia? - Samarqand, I think. -Correct. And both countries lie quite close to the Black Sea. What do you know about the Black Sea? Well, it's famous for its sturgeon, its caviar-- Caviar! Right. Caviar, fish eggs. And the king of Samarqand recently sent a gift of 500 pounds of dehydrated royal caviar to Gotham City. What's Gotham City gonna do with 500 pounds of dehydrated caviar? No one could decide. So it's being stored in a specially-cooled vault at the Gotham National Bank. - And it's worth $200 an ounce. So -So? Let's go. Now that we've moved most of our cash to our upstate branch I feel much better. With Egghead in town, no bank is safe. What's that? The Cossacks! Do not draw revolver, little shmyerdski or I am having Ossip bash you to beatniks. Ossip, remove revolver from little shmyerdski. You are head man here? Yes, and you might as well turn right around and go back where you came from. There's no money in that vault. But we will make look-see anyway, no? Ha. Go ahead. We shipped all of our money upstate. Ha, ha. Perhaps we're not coming for money. Ha, ha, ha. There's nothing else in there. Ha,ha,ha,ha. Perhaps you are forgetting the caviar? Good heavens, the caviar! Old Cossack saying: Do not make "ha" before eggs are safe. Hm? Inside. Snatch the caviar and make fast goodbye. Whoa! Egghead! Who did you expect, Batman? Where are Olga and her Cossacks? Eggs-plain. Oh, you're late. They've already left with my caviar. Why won't that woman slow down? I'll never catch up with her. Shoot him! He's in league with that Cossack gang. Oh, no, no. Don't shoot, please. NARRATOR". At least Batgirl's found a one-man panic in the streets. Oh, protect me, Batgirl. That monster is going to shoot me. Not so brave when your henchmen aren't around, are you? Oh, I never claimed to be brave, Batgirl. No, I'm clever and crafty, but I'm a complete coward. You won't let him shoot me? That depends. Where are the Cossacks you've been running around with? Oh, they're gone, Batgirl. They left before I came. - Left for where, Egghead? -I don't know. No? Well, they did mention their destination, but you see they speak Bessarovian and I don't speak the language. Perhaps there are some other languages you do know, Egghead. The language spoken by that guard's gun. Oh, no. Oh, please, you can't ask me to rat on my friends. Oh, yes, I can. And you'd better start ratting fast. Do you expect me, a respected arch-criminal to fink on my friends like a common stool pigeon? Of course. - All right, I'll do it. -Let's go. Oh, but it make take us some time. You see, my burro is kind of slow. Forget your burro. Get on the back of my Batgirl cycle and show me your hideout. On that thing? But I might be eggs-tinguished. All right, then stay here. But I won't be responsible for any stray bullets that just might happen your way. No, wait for me. Two blocks down and to the left. Oh, Batman, thank heaven you're here. The royal caviar has been stolen by that mad Bessarovian queen and her henchmen. I was afraid we might be too late. Where's Egghead? He arrived just after they left. We were about to shoot-- I mean, arrest him when Batgirl drove up and convinced him to take her to his hideaway. - The Cossacks. -Exactly, Robin. Batgirl is a match for any gang of ordinary hoodlums but for a wild band of Bessarovian Cossacks even her extraordinary abilities might not be enough. Let's go. We have to find that hideout before she does. They went down that street and to the left, Batman. Thank you, sir. Oh. Oh. Well, this is it, Batgirl. We're going in there, Egghead, and no funny business. Oh, you can trust me, Batgirl. I'd sooner trust a snake with fangs at both ends. - Mush now. -Yes. Here we are, Batgirl. The hideout is through that door. Good. Then open the door and announce me, Egghead. And no tricks. Tricks? Oh, Batgirl, how could you suspect me of trying to trick you? Hm. I love caviar. No testing. Olga, Olga, my dear. We have a visitor. Batgirl. Ah. Very funny. What is this joking, Eggski? Olga, my little bride-to-be, she was here not two seconds ago. I brought her here so that we could ambush her. The ambush is on the other foot now, Egghead. You tricked me. And now, my little pipkin you will do for us saber dance with frosted swords. Dance it, yeah! She's good dancer, Eggski. Yes, she's dancing to her grave. Ha, ha, ha. Naturally. There it is, Batman. Yes, Robin. It's fortunate that the turbo engine on her cycle uses a radioactive spark plug so that we were able to trace it here with our Bat-geiger Counter. We move carefully, Robin so that we'll be able to take them by surprise. Now it's your turn to face the music, Olga. Very sad we meet at funeral. Your funeral, Batman. I believe you overestimate your undertaking abilities, Egghead. My Cossacks, hack them to shashliks. Give them one for me, Batman. Eggski, up from there. Oh, but I might be hurt, Olga. - You come with me, my little mousenik. -Ah! - Grab her. -Yes. Ah! Unh! We are drowning her in caviar. - Drowning her in caviar. -Bye, Batgirl. Come on, go! Help, Batman! I'm drowning! Unh! I'm also freezing! Batgirl's being frozen in that caviar. There she is. Batgirl, I'll untie you. Thank you, Batman. They almost turned me into a human hors d'oeuvre. What a chilling way to die. Holy cold creeps. Leave it to crooks like them to think of a trick like this. Yes, that's to be expected, Robin. The concept of decency is alien to the criminal mind. And thanks to me, they've escaped. Perhaps crime-fighting is better left to the men, Batgirl. Perhaps not. But this isn't exactly women's work. - But I'm no ordinary woman, Batman. -Agreed. At least we've recovered the dehydrated royal caviar. It's lucky you had me surround that building once more, Batman. Olga and Egghead ran right into the paddy wagon again. Only this time, they didn't want to. Heh, heh. - Forewarned is forearmed, Chief O'Hara. - That's true, Batman. I'm sure they won't find caviar on the menu at Gotham State Prison. Probably not, but they will get a well-balanced diet thanks to Warden Crichton's emphasis on proper nutrition. What is it, Barbara? I just saw the strangest-looking car outside. It was sort of greenish-gold and had what looked like whiskers on its front fenders. A car with whiskers? Sounds like Catwoman's Kitty Car to me, Batman. Catwoman was driving it. And if I'm not mistaken, that arch-criminal the Joker was a passenger. - Holy here we go again, Batman. -I'm afraid you're right, old churn. If Catwoman and Joker have joined forces it sounds like there's trouble right here in Gotham City. NARRATOR". And how right he is. Trouble in a green fright wig. Trouble in a car with whiskers. More trouble than the Caped Crusaders have ever known. Coming up on our next episode. 
NARRATOR". A festive day in Gotham City. And at a civic luncheon at the Gotham-Astoria Police Commissioner Gordon is being honored for 25 years of faithful service. For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny Oh. Thank you, Chief O'Hara. But I really don't think I deserve all this. - Daddy, you're too modest. -Sure on that, he is. Right, Mr. Wayne? The commissioner deserves far more than we can ever repay. He's given the best years of his life to Gotham City. Where the devil is Mayor Linseed? He's supposed to present a special award to the commissioner. There he is now, with Mrs. Linseed. They seem to be arguing about something. Ladies and gentlemen, as a token of our appreciation for Commissioner Gordon's long service I wish to present him with this 24-karat gold watch. - Commissioner. -Oh, thank you. And now due to circumstances beyond my control uh, that is, um, due to overwhelming considerations I hereby discharge Commissioner Gordon. And in his stead, I appoint as the new police commissioner of Gotham City Ms. Nora Clavicle. The famous Nora Clavicle. I didn't realize her crusade for women had gone this far. I'd say she's won that crusade. Saints preserve us. Saints preserve us all. Thank you, Mayor Linseed. As the new police commissioner I intend to carry on my crusade for women's rights. And to prove that women can run Gotham City better than men. Much better. So my first official act will be to appoint a new police chief. Mrs. Linseed. I had no other choice, Mr. Wayne. My wife is such a devoted follower of Ms. Clavicle's crusade for women that she refused to cook or clean or wash my shirts until I appointed Ms. Clavicle commissioner of police. I've worn this shirt for a week. I haven't had a decent meal in months. It's all right, Mayor Linseed. We understand. Commissioner can you ever forgive me? Of course, Mayor Linseed, I understand how difficult it was for you. The question is, how difficult is it going to be for Gotham City? One moment, sir. I mean, ma'am. It's her, sir. Yes, Ms. Clavicle? Commissioner Clavicle, Batman calling to tell you you can take an extended vacation. We girls are handling things now and we won't need any help from you men bat or otherwise. Goodbye, Batman. Hmm. There's something curious about this affair. Very curious, indeed, sir. Well, we're dressed for investigating, let's investigate. There's nothing to investigate yet, Robin. However, we could take a ride around Gotham City just in case. Well, good luck, sir. We men are counting on you, you know. Right, Alfred. To the Batmobile. NARRATOR". While, in the secret closet behind Barbara Gordon's bedroom Batgirl has a very similar idea. But even as she starts her own investigation what's happening in Commissioner Gordon 's-- Er, Commissioner Clavicle's office? Nora, what you're doing is wonderful. Women will finally take their rightful place in the world. Half the credit is yours, Millie dear. You reorganized the police department. It was nothing, really. Nothing? To fire every man on the police force and replace them all with women that was quite a job. Well, I'd better see that things are running smoothly. You do that, dear. Ah. Now that she's out of the way, you girls may proceed with Operation Ransack while I proceed with Operation Disaster Insurance. But what about Batman and Robin, boss? Those masked menfolk? Pshaw. And what about Batgirl? Oh, yes. I forgot about her. With a woman helping them Batman and Robin might just give us some trouble. But all we have to do is make a call and lead them into a trap. We, uh, can't call them, boss. You, uh, cut the wire. So I did. But we can still lead them into a trap. Well, how? How can we find them? Where does one usually find Batman and Robin? Well, usually they're at the scene of some crime-- Aha. Heh. Oh, yes, I see what you mean. Later at the Gotham City Bank, Angelina and Evelina are making the scene. Of a crime. Hand over the goodies and don't dawdle. - Officer! -Oh! Now look what you've made me do. But there's a robbery. It's all smeared. Then add a little paprika and simmer over a little flame for 15 minutes. - Don't forget the bay leaves. -And a peppercorn or two. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you? When my bank's just been burgled? I hadn't thought of bay leaves. Yeah. Officer, chase them! They've just robbed my bank! How can I chase them when they have the car? And all I have are my new Givenchy shoes. And I'm certainly not gonna wreck them. What's that, Car 6? A clearance sale at Arbech's? Ooh! Calling all cars. Girls, listen. Arbech's has just marked all their dresses down 20 percent. I've been cruising around myself, Batman, and everything seems to be normal so far. Don't forget the shoe sale at Dubar's, girls. Wonderful bargains. Oh, by the way Gotham National Bank has just been robbed. But the big news is the two-for-one sale at Slob's Drugs. - Holy bargain basements, Batman. -Our concern is the bargain hunters at the Gotham National Bank. -Right, Batman. Thank goodness you're here, Batman. Two girl bank robbers just robbed my bank, while the policewomen did nothing. Then they took off into thin air in a getaway car. Sometimes you can see a great deal in thin air, sir. You mean, back to the Batcomputer in the Batcave, Batman? No time. We'll use the portable Batcomputer in the Batmobile. I think I'll tag along, Batman. The instruments in the Batgirl-cycle aren't as sophisticated as those in the Batmobile. -Thank you. Following the portable Batcomputer's lead the terrific trio drop in on the warehouse of Dropstitch & Company manufacturers of fine knitting needles. But who has the drop on whom? Don't make a move, Batgirl. Nor you either, Dynamic Duo. Holy knit one, purl two. Exactly, Boy Wonder. This needle is razor-sharp and can puncture her jugular vein in an instant. All right, girls. Let's tie the terrific trio into terrific Siamese human knots. You are wise to stay motionless. Or you will be the terminated trio. The slightest move by any one of you will only draw the human knot tighter. Crush your bones and strangle you. Holy hamstrings. Exactly, Robin. This is torture at its most bizarre and terrible. I understand your desire to Checkmate us, Ms. Clavicle. Commissioner Clavicle, Batman. But I strongly suspect there's more to your scheme than just tying us in a Siamese human knot. Very observant, Batman. And you're right. There is more. Much more. As soon as night falls I'm planning to destroy all of Gotham City. - All of Gotham City? -Why? Do you know what this document is, Batman? If I dared move my head, I might recognize it. But I daren't. It's an insurance policy on Gotham City. Holy underwritten metropolis. Exactly, boy bowknot. I've insured Gotham City for 10 million dollars. And what do you think it cost me? Two hundred dollars, perhaps? Two hundred dollars for a 10-million-dollar policy? Yes, Batgirl. Because the risk is so low. The chances of destroying an entire city are infinitesimal. Right again, Batman. But Gotham City will be destroyed. I'll collect the 10 million and there won't be any witnesses around to make trouble. Oh, you'll find it completely impossible to ever get out of that human knot. But it will all be over soon. Come on, Evelina. Angelina should be outside with the truck by now. Don't move. Do we dare breathe, Batman? Cautiously, Robin. Cautiously. Talking has been dangerous enough. A deep breath might prove fatal. Are they all set to go off? One half hour after sunset? Yes, boss. Good. That will give them time to distribute themselves throughout the city. And when they explode there won't be a building left standing in Gotham City. Oh, they're darling little creatures. Lovely. Lovely. I loathe standing in lines, Chief O'Hara. Well, at least it's only one day a week, commissioner. Besides, uh, what else can we do? Get other jobs. But we've been policemen almost all of our lives. - We don't know how to do anything else. -True enough, Chief O'Hara. We only know one trade, and suddenly that trade is closed to us. Taken over by women. Begorra, the shame of it. I can't stand this much longer, Batman. I'm getting terrible cramps in my legs. - Good. -Good? Terrible cramps? Exactly, Robin. The involuntary muscular contractions in Batgirl's legs may indirectly relieve the tension in your lower lumbar region. Holy slipped disk. Not quite, Robin. If I can wiggle my ears and if you are able to bend the fourth finger on your left hand just a fraction of an inch You might strangle us all. Release us, Batgirl. It's the basic formula for escaping from a Siamese human knot. I just recalled it. Ready? - Ready, Robin? -Ready. I'm beginning to wiggle my ears under my cowl. All right. Releasing my fourth finger. I'm wiggling. I've got it. Gosh, Batman. What a simple way to get out of a Siamese human knot. But what do we do now? Yes, we really know nothing of Ms. -- Commissioner Clavicle's plan to destroy Gotham City. Perhaps we can start with that. What's inside it? A high explosive charge and a timing device. Apparently set to go off a half an hour after sunset. But how could a little charge--? - Holy mechanical armies. -Exactly, Robin. There's a legion of these lethal mice whirring through Gotham City at this very moment. - We can't catch them all. Not before dark. -I know. Robin, call Chief O'Ha-- Chief Linseed on the police channel. Tell her to mobilize her entire force and send them out to gather up these mice. I'll be back by the time you finish that call. Connect me with Chief Linseed, please. It's an emergency. Chief Linseed? Yes, Robin? We know about the mice. But I'm afraid my police force won't be very much help to you. Officer, are those mice still down there? Yes, Chief Linseed. Oh, excuse me, Robin, I'm afraid I'm going to faint. Me too. I might have known you can't get policewomen to help you catch mice. It's diabolical. I'm afraid you're right, Robin. But we may have one last hope. What are you doing, Batman? This is no time for games. Robin, look. How did you do it, Batman? There's no time to explain, Robin. I want you both to play exactly the same tune that you just heard. Batgirl, you take the east side, Robin, take west side. East side, west side. I'll go through midtown. We'll meet at the docks. - But-- -Just play, Robin. Play for all you're worth. NARRATOR". With only moments left before disaster the terrific trio and their retinue of rodents arrive at dockside. We made it. With very few moments to spare. But how did you know they'd follow us, Batman? I was able to determine that the guidance systems in the mice was built around the principle of high-frequency radar. So by selecting the right combination of flute toots I was able to cause those mice and their homing mechanisms to zero in on the source of the sounds: the flutes. The pied pipers of Gotham City. You might say that. I see you have some interesting freight there. That we do, Batman. Caught them at the edge of town. Just as you said we might when you phoned me. They were exceeding the speed limit by a considerable margin, sir so we thought it best to take them into custody. You can't arrest us. You have no power. Citizen's arrest, me fine-feathered females. Heh. You should have bought some prison insurance, Ms. Clavicle. She'll need it where she's going, Boy Wonder. A long-term policy with Warden Crichton as the beneficiary. It'll be nice to have our old jobs backs again, won't it, commissioner? It will indeed, Chief O'Hara. It will indeed. Well, with Nora Clavicord behind bars-- - Chief O'Hara, that's Clavicle. -Oh. Well, a rose by any other name, commissioner. And what a rose she was. With Mrs. Linseed under her thumb and all those exploding mice under her feet. Yes. At least she didn't pull it off. Thanks to Batman, Robin and Batgirl. Do you think we'll have a breather now, commissioner? Oh, unless we get some disturbing phone call, Chief O'Hara. Commissioner Gordon. Penguin? Just let me ask you one thing, commissioner. Did you ever hear of the lethal Lygerian fruit fly? NARRATOR". And Commissioner Gordon certainly will hear of lethal Lygerian fruit flies. And so shall we all when Penguin pulls his insidious insect antic in our next episode. 
 NARRATOR". Daybreak at Gotham City Library where Penguin has just purloined a priceless folio of famous umbrellas. Ha, ha, ha. I know where to dispose of you for a good price. Then Lulu and I are off to the races. Ha, ha, ha. - Caught with the goods, eh, Penguin? -Faugh, how did you get unglued? - Hand over that folio, you feathered felon. -And come quietly. Oh, I always knew I'd come to the end of the road. Holy diversionary tactic. I'll have my men pick him up in a jiffy. - No. -No? Since we didn't apprehend him in this office and he got away with the folio let's let him play out his hand. I suspect that this robbery is only part of a much bigger caper. Escaped? With the folio? - Hello, Ms. Gordon. -Hello, Batman, Robin, Chief O'Hara. And last but not least I told you we can handle this. You needn't have gotten up so early. Well, it was almost time to open anyway, Daddy. Who was it? The Penguin again? Yes, and that slimy bird slipped right through our fingers. I guess I better phone Bruce Wayne. As head of the library's board of trustees, he'd be upset at the loss of a rare item. You needn't bother Mr. Wayne needlessly, Ms. Gordon. - Needlessly? That folio is invaluable. - I'll have that folio back within an hour. I suspected he might make this move and I prepared a counter one. Today is the day of the Bruce Wayne Foundation Handicap at Gotham Park Racetrack. I'm sure Mr. Wayne has many other important things on his mind. Well, Robin, to the Batcave. Lulu, that's magnificent. That is the sharpest-looking horse of another color I've ever seen in my life. At least nobody will recognize him. But I do hope nobody recognizes that the horse from the glue factory in Parasol's stall is a phony. By the time they do, the race will be over. Ha, ha, ha. What about the track officials, the jockey? Wally Bootmaker is supposed to ride Parasol. He's not blind. Don't worry about Wally Bootmaker. My two finks will take care of him when they get back. Well, here we are. Business as usual, huh? Penguin's Bookshop. Hello, Sammy. Iron Marshmallow in the big race. No, listen, I got a tip it's gonna be scratched. Matter of fact, I got a tip that all but two of the horses are gonna be scratched. Parasol and a late entry by the name of Bumbershoot. But the big bet, Sammy, is Parasol. All right, I'll take it, but pay cash, Sammy. Ha, ha, ha. What do you mean, all but two horses will be scratched? -"Scratched" means withdrawn from the race. -I know what it means. - But what do you mean, Pengy? -I got a plan. I hope so. But why did you tell him to bet on Parasol and not on Bumbershoot? Because the more money that's bet on that phony nag, which is bound to lose the more money we'll make because the odds will be higher. All I have to do is to unload this folio there and get some money to bet. - What's that, the racing news? -No, this is the Saturday review of folios. All the rich collectors and advertisers. Wait a minute. This sounds like a pigeon. "Wanted. For private collections. Priceless folios of all famous articles, particularly parasols. Will pay top prices. Mr. A. L. Fredd. " The Gotham West Hotel. That's a very, very wealthy hotel. I'll just call. I'm sure that our 10 grand is gonna be in the feed bag, Lulu. It's not Lulu. It's Lola Lasagne. Well, have it your way. Lasagne, macaroni, whatever. Hello, will you give me Mr. A. L. Fredd? It's the Penguin Bookshop for him. Heh. Hello, Mr. A. L. Fredd? Yes, this is A. L. Fredd. - Should we take this up with the Batcomputer? -Take what up? The location of Penguin's hideout, for one thing. It's a little bookmaking shop on Fleece Street. I did a little extracurricular crime-detecting while Dick Grayson did his homework. And also found out you're gonna have that folio back in an hour? I still want Penguin to play out his hand, Robin. And I believe you'll find that the priceless folio is upstairs in Bruce Wayne's study. I just came in, Ms. Gordon. I don't know if Mr. Wayne is here or-- Oh, he just walked in. One moment, please. It's Ms. Gordon from the library, sir. And there's the priceless folio. A steal at $10,000. Hello, Ms. Gordon. Oh, Mr. Wayne, I'm glad I finally reached you. I've been trying for over an hour. Dick and I were out taking our usual early constitutional. Apparently Alfred didn't hear the telephone. What can I do for you, Ms. Gordon? Well, completely against Batman's suggestion and my father's advice I thought you should know. The priceless folio of famous parasols we keep in a locked case was stolen earlier this morning. Yes, by the Penguin. He apparently made his entrance with some sort of passkey and his exit through a window by using his umbrella as a parachute. A man of many talents. You're not upset at such a loss? I'm not upset, Ms. Gordon, because the priceless folio is, at this very moment, on the desk in front of me. One second, please. Yes, Alfred tells me that Batman returned it just a few minutes ago, Ms. Gordon. Oh, well, that's incredible. Batman said he'd have it back within an hour, but-- You didn't believe him? Well, I'm afraid I'm still naive enough to believe the impossible can't be done. I guess I owe Batman an apology. A word of thanks should do at the proper time. I'll see that the folio is returned to the library shortly. - Goodbye, Ms. Gordon. - Good bye. Good work, Mr. Fredd. I feel we're one step closer, Dick. One step closer? When you're now out $10,000 to that pompous purloiner? "Patient men win the day," an apt quotation from Chaucer. Apt maybe, but I doubt if Chaucer had run into Penguin when he wrote it. While back with the baleful bookie Those freeways are murder, boss. No explanations, no excuses, and you shut up. I wanna see what the radio has to say about this. --Priceless folio of famous parasols stolen this morning from the Gotham Library has been recovered by Batman and returned to Bruce Wayne, chairman of the board of directors. Any further details are lacking at this time, but Commissioner Gordon-- Returned already. Quadruple faugh. She is gonna pay for this. Who's she? Ms. Gordon, that's who. She works at the library, doesn't she? She knows that that folio was stolen. She also happens to know Bruce Wayne, who knows Batman who just might know A. L. Fredd. We got the 10 grand, Pengy. Why ruffle your feathers? Because I smell a deep and dire plot in all this. But Ms. Gordon is going to smell something even worse. - What's that? Another radio? -No, a little toy for the police commissioner's daughter. -Does it walk? Of course it walks. And as it walks a little while, it throws out a deadly gas on anybody who toys with it. Pengy, all we wanna do is win a horse race. We don't wanna kill anyone. She spurned me, didn't she? Well, she's not gonna get a second chance. Take this over to the police commissioner's daughter. - Tell her it's a gift from an admirer. -Okay, boss. Visor, you go to the racetrack and you get rid of this Wally Bootmaker. - I don't care how, just get rid of him. -Right, Penguin. We'll follow with our dark horse. And while I am making the entries, I want you to get rid of all the other horses. Me? How? Well, it's simple enough. They know you there. Just apply plenty of this. Ha, ha, ha. NARRATOR". Meanwhile at Gotham Park Racetrack the racing secretary has some startling news for millionaire Bruce Wayne. Every horse except Parasol has been scratched? That's right, Mr. Wayne. And Wally Bootmaker has disappeared. And there's someone here with a last-minute entry called Bumbershoot. Yes, he's in my office now. Well, he has his entry fee. - Says he's the owner-trainer. -And jockey. What does he look like? Confidentially, he's a bit of a bird. Let him enter Bumbershoot. I'll get another jockey to ride Parasol. And there will be another last-minute entry from the Bruce Wayne Stables. But don't say anything about it yet. Just as I thought. Penguin has not only overplayed his hand, he's tipped his mitt. Somehow he's managed to switch horses and put the big money on the wrong horse. Probably that goat from the glue factory. But what's this about another last-minute entry from Wayne Stables? Waynebeau, my new 3-year-old, should win it. I didn't wanna enter him earlier. I didn't want it to appear as if I were setting up own my horse to win the Bruce Wayne Foundation Handicap. Now, about jockeys Bruce, let me ride Waynebeau. I'm light enough. No, Dick, I couldn't allow my own ward to ride my own thoroughbred. - People might think it was funny. -Hm. But you can ride the fake Parasol and try to win it. But if I did win, wouldn't that upset all your plans? No, I'll get another jockey to ride the other horse. Who? Well No, I wouldn't even know where to look for her. - Her? -Batgirl. Gosh, yes, she'd be great. On our side and all. And all, Dick. But who is she and where is she? I wouldn't know how to go about finding her. So a short time later, Barbara Gordon receives several surprises. A little toy penguin. Oh, what a cute gadget. And look, it winds up. Oh, be careful, Myrtle. Oh, be careful of a darling little thing like this? Whoa! Myrtle? Myrtle! NARRATOR". And while Penguin's pusillanimous plot proceeds Barbara gets a second surprise. Oh, thank you. - Myrtle, are you all right? -I think so. I only got a little whiff of that smoke, but it certainly made me dizzy. You should lie down in the lounge. I'll help you. Never mind, Barbara, I can make it. These diabolical tricks must be stopped. - I'm gonna call my father. -Oh, one moment. I think this toy penguin has probably breathed its last poisonous breath. And it's just possible that a certain live Penguin may be rendered equally useless. Can we have a word together? NARRATOR". And speaking of words This is a farce, Mr. Wayne. An unknown jockey on the horse that's the favorite? An unknown horse with that birdman on board. And your own entry, which even the touts and tipsters haven't heard about yet. I demand that the Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap -be canceled this afternoon. - Oh, you do? Yes, as racing secretary of this meet, I have a duty to owners, trainers, officials and track fans and myself. Why, if there were any logical explanation for such a travesty if Batman, for instance, told me that this race must be run for a particular reason, well, that might be different. But just to satisfy a stubborn whim of your own, Mr. Wayne as honorable a man as I know you are And suppose Batman did tell you that the race must be run? I would have to hear it from him in person. Hm. A very capable man, the racing secretary. Remind me to give him a bonus, Alfred. You say you talked to Batgirl. I did manage to convey your message, sir, yes. Yes, would you convey a change of Bruce Wayne's clothing to the governor's suite at the Turf Club? -Yes, sir. While Batman conveys a message to the racing secretary. While an excited crowd awaits the running of the Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap the racing secretary hears from Batman in person. This race must be run. When it's over, I'll tell you why. And I'm sure Mr. Wayne himself will make a public announcement. Very well, Batman. I still think it's a farce, but I'll bow to your judgment. NARRATOR". And Lola Lasagne meets her new jockey. I wish you were Spanish. Oh, you are Spanish. Do you speak Spanish? Good, it's nice to have a Spanish-speaking jockey on a Spanish-speaking horse. Ha, ha. NARRATOR". And Penguin smells a rat. That jockey, you know who he looks like? Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne's ward. What would Dick Grayson be doing as a saddle monkey, boss? One thing he'll be doing soon is eating my dust. Ha, ha, ha. Be a good girl, Parasol. You know who that kid is up on that phony nag of yours? A darling Spanish boy. I'm so glad you hijacked Wally Bootmaker. He might have smelled a mouse. I smell a mousetrap. Did you put the bet down on Bumbershoot? I still have 10 minutes. Faugh, get going. Meet me outside the jockey room right after the race. All right, ready? Never mind, I got it. Ha, ha, ha. The horses are coming on the track with the $100,000 Wayne Foundation Memorial Handicap. One mile and one furlong. NARRATOR". But as the horses come out on the track, what's this? Waynebeau making his surprise appearance. With a very surprising saddle monkey aboard. Who's that riding your horse, Waynebeau, Mr. Wayne? It looks like It is. That new crime-fighter I've heard something about, Batgirl. Why, this is getting more farcical by the moment. Let's just say there's a touch of irony in it. Well, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara, won't you join us? Batman called me. He said something very interesting might turn up here this afternoon so, Chief O'Hara and I better be on our toes. Good idea. Come on, chief. What is that third horse doing down there? A very late entry, madam. I believe he's called Waynebeau. Well, that looks like a girl riding it. Doesn't it, though? - I better go make my bet. -Yeah. ANNOUNCER". It is now post time. I want one $10,000 ticket on number two, please. Bumbershoot is not steady yet, not straight. They're waiting on Bumbershoot. He stretches. The flag is up. There they go. Parasol is moving to the front Bumbershoot is second, Waynebeau is third. Coming down the stretch the first time, it's Parasol in front by two lengths. Bumbershoot is second, two and a half lengths. Waynebeau on the inside. Passing the stand the first time it's Parasol in front by two and a half lengths. Bumbershoot is second by two lengths on the inside. Waynebeau looking for racing room. There goes Waynebeau up on the inside. And Bumbershoot moves out. Around the clubhouse turn, it's Bumbershoot on the outside in front and Waynebeau has moved up, but is in tight quarters. And on the rail, Parasol. Into the back stretch, it's Bumbershoot coming clear by four lengths. On the inside, Parasol and Waynebeau. It's Bumbershoot in front by two lengths and Parasol second and Waynebeau coming out. Here comes Waynebeau moving to the outside. And Waynebeau on the outside. Here comes Waynebeau to Bumbershoot. It's Bumbershoot still in front. Holding on, on the outside, Waynebeau, and Parasol is third. At the half mile, here's Bumbershoot in front. Now here comes Waynebeau on the outside, is now coming in, taking the lead. It's Waynebeau on the outside. Parasol moving on the inside, but can't find room. It's Waynebeau. Waynebeau coming clear. Bumbershoot is second, Parasol is far behind. It's Waynebeau in front, Waynebeau on the inside and Bumbershoot again trying to challenge. Parasol is third. Waynebeau is looking for room, comes on out and comes to the leader. It's Waynebeau coming clear. It's Waynebeau now in front by one and Parasol is on the outside. It's Waynebeau. And now Bumbershoot again. Waynebeau. And Waynebeau is flying. There goes Waynebeau flying away. Waynebeau wins it easily. Bumbershoot is second, Parasol is third. Hold your tickets. Please, hold all tickets until the result of the race has been declared official. My word. You may have a good-sized riot on your hands, Mr. Wayne. Almost everyone bet on Parasol. Batman better have a good explanation too. I'm sure he will. It's a very dark day for racing in Gotham City, Mr. Wayne. Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne? I'll change, then we better make tracks. Why? We haven't done anything wrong. We haven't done anything right. We just lost 10 grand. And the paint is running faster than the horse did. You can't go in there. You're a woman. No need to change clothes, Penguin. They'll issue you a nice striped wardrobe where you're going. Faugh. Armband, Visor, bridle that filly. Help, reserves! Reserves! Your odds haven't been too good this afternoon, Penguin. But five men against one girl is ridiculous. Oh, I'm enjoying this. Don't bother. No bother to return the many favors you've done for us, Batgirl. Mash them! Well, Penguin, looks like your perfidious prank is up. Perfidious? Faugh, I admit I fixed the race, but I fixed it so the best horse won. Regardless of that, I'm sure that the results of the Handicap will be declared permanently unofficial. And you'll be declared permanently incarcerated. - You too, Lulu Schultz. -Lulu Schultz? - I am Senora Lola Lasagne. -Lasa-- Ha, ha. In a penguin's tailfeather. Ha, ha, ha. - All right, come on, come on, let's go. -You too. Oh, yeah, thataway. Batgirl, she's gone again. Like spray. Like a cloud. Like lightning. We should try to find her and thank her. Mere thanks are empty words, Robin. Whoever she is, wherever she goes, whatever she's after I think we'll be seeing more of her. A little dusty, Barbara? Oh, hi, Daddy. I was just trying to spruce up the Egyptology section of the library but the sands of time seemed to have pretty well buried it. I was going to call you at your office, but I haven't had time. I haven't been at the office, I've been at the races. Races? The police commissioner? All in the line of duty, Barbara, and it paid off. The Penguin and a female cohort tried to fix the Bruce Wayne Handicap but we fixed them. So to celebrate, I thought I would take my favorite librarian out on the town tonight. Your favorite librarian would love it. Just let me freshen up a little bit. What's the matter? King Tut. I didn't expect to turn up a pharaoh in here. Where did he go? Well, you can never tell about King Tut, my dear, but I better alert Batman. You mean, a real arch-criminal has turned up here in the library? Well, part of him anyway. He's a split personality. A modern-day Yale professor some of the time. And the rest of the time? A reincarnated Egyptian despot. Old as the pyramids, wise as the sphinx. - Oh, he sounds fascinating. -Uh-uh. No, darling, not fascinating. He is fiendishly evil, the most dangerous kind of fraud. I better get word to the dynamic duo. NARRATOR". So, King Tut has returned, but for what evil purpose? With what nefarious scheme? And what is he doing in this library? Watch the next episode for the awesome answer. 
NARRATOR". When we said our last fearful farewells to Batman and Robin the malevolent Mad Hatter had trapped them in a fluoroscopic cabinet of an atomic energy laboratory where, exposed to high-voltage x-rays it would only be a matter of moments before they'd be radiated forever. For you, another few hours have gone by for the Dynamic Duo, an eternity as we shall shortly see. Horror of horrors, can it have happened at long, long last? The disastrous demise of the Dynamic Duo? Yesterday, flesh and blood now cowled skeletons. But who could this be? The Mad Hatter again? Demented enough to return to the scene of his fossilized folly? Now what's the matter, Polly? I told you what to expect. But I didn't expect it. Why did you bring me here if you knew about this all the time? Every man likes a pretty girl with him at a skeleton dance. This time, Jervis, you've gone too far. At least far enough, boss. There's still ground to be covered. But with Batman and Robin out of the way, as I've seen with my own two eyes the rest of this caper should be a picnic. A picnic? At a time like this? Let's get out of here before anybody discovers us. Although apparently no one is keeping a death watch. Hey, boss, you know you could have picked up another cowl in there. A morbid thought, Skimmer. The one I tricked Batman out of last night will fill the bill beautifully. No. I won't believe it. I don't believe it. I can't believe it. My world has just been ripped to shreds seam by seam. Come now, commissioner, nothing could be as bad as all that. This is, chief. A cleaning woman at the Gotham Atomic Energy Laboratory-- Now, now, easy does it. --Just called the editor of the Gotham Post Tribune. - Maybe if you loosened your tie. -And told them-- Have you still got that bottle here in your drawer? --That she had seen the-- The skeletons of Batman and Robin. The what? The skeletons of the Caped Crusaders shrouded in their cowls-- Hold on to me, commissioner. --In a fluoroscopic cabinet where they met their maker-- Don't say it. --Under high-voltage x-ray. No. Pennsylvania 6-5-0-0-0. Oh! No, no, no. Well, he's at his ranch right now, but I'm sure he'll fly to Gotham City right away. Trafalgar 6-5-0-0-0. Oh! No, no, no. She's at Windsor Castle. She'll fly to Gotham City immediately. Belatzova 6-5-0-0-0. - Herr Batman? -I wanna thank you for your assistance Professor Overbeck. -Oh, please, don't thank me. You know, if it weren't for that little thingamajig You mean the Bat X-ray deflector in my utility belt. Gosh, yes. Sure a great gadget for deflecting all types of radiation in an instant. It never hurts to be prepared, professor. Oh, and you certainly were. You know, with that extra cowl you wore under your contaminated one and the additional wardrobe you had in your Batmobile. Hmm! It never would've worked if it hadn't been for the two skeletons in your closet. Now I think we should get to the Batcave. Wait a minute. Remember, we left the Batmobile in back. Holy memory bank, you're right. NARRATOR". But earth-shaking events or solitary moments, crime marches on. Look, Jervis, they're coming down the tank now. So I see. Ha, ha. Batman thought he was so smart planting that tracking gizmo in this cowl. But now it's planted forever in that tank at the top of the tower. Oh, the Mad Hatter has outsmarted the dear departed. Heh. Jervis, you sound like the Joker or the Puzzler, or even the Riddler. Those phonies? Well, if Batman is so departed why do you go to all the trouble of hiding the tracking gizmo? I'm not hiding it, Polly, I'm drowning it. Now, obviously the Caped Crusader's little accident will be discovered. Now, there will be questions asked. The police will be called in. I don't want anything to lead them to me. At least not until I have replaced the priceless ruby in the Golden Buddha of Bergama's forehead with this cheap replica from Hattie Hatfield's headdress. Cheap replica? Of course, this is not the real Hatfield ruby. You mean you knew that all the time? All the time, Polly. My entire plan was to find a ruby similar to one in the Buddha's forehead and then get rid of Batman and Robin. Now I've succeeded in both. Now, just as soon as Benny and Skimmer come in we're off to the Gotham Art Center. - Why there? -That's where the Buddha goes on exhibit in one hour. Now, all we have to do is overpower the Royal Bergama Guard "accompanying the exhibit on its world tour. And then with the aid of my reliable ruby retriever we'll switch rubies, and we're off and running. We'd better be off and running right now. Yeah. Have you been outside recently? Not since we came in here. Why? Because everything's come to a dead stop, that's why. Someone found those two skeletons. Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later. Well, it happened sooner. All business is shut down. The people are flocking to their home by the thousands. The whole town's at half-mast. What a perfect time to snatch the ruby. Now, Jervis, I'm not so sure that I-- Now, don't go soft on me, Polly. Who made Batman and Robin famous crime-fighters? Criminals, that's who. If you want to show a little respect to the departed stay crooked. That's the least you could do. Sure, boss. You bet. I guess you're right, Jervis. It is sort of like putting flowers on their graves. I'm sorry, Mildred. There are already over 4000 women on the funeral committee alone. But I might work you in on the Statue of Batman Committee. Good, I'll put your name down. It's just wonderful the way the citizens get together when it's a national crisis, isn't it? Oh, Alfred, how touching. You're in mourning too. And you're not even a native citizen. Now, you two boys must get black armbands too. Aunt Harriet - Oh. What in the world is that? -That's what I was coming to tell you, madam. An immense crowd has gathered outside. I had to close the gates. You see, madam, they know that, um, Mr. Bruce was a friend of Batman's and - Yes, yes. -Well, they're just here. See that they're served coffee and sandwiches. And we'll see them as soon as we get composed a little more. Aunt Harriet. Aunt Harriet, what would your reaction be if I told you that beyond a shadow of a doubt I knew that Batman and Robin are still alive? Well, I just wouldn't believe it, that's all. What if I told you, Aunt Harriet? Oh, you two are sweet to try to bolster my shattered spirits. But after all, I myself was the one who telephoned Professor Overbeck at the atomic laboratory. And he wouldn't lie, would he? Dick, um, perhaps you and I should have a moment alone in my study. I think so, Bruce. Oh, that's a beautiful way for you to express your respects. Hello? Oh, hello, Esther. One more try, Dick? It's the only thing to do, Bruce. Fifty-thousand people just standing. The greatest of all the ills of man is grief, Chief O'Hara. Mother McGillicutty, he's calling from the grave. One thing we do know, at least Batman isn't buried yet. Yes? - Batman? -Commissioner, I tried to get you earlier. For as a great man before me has said: "The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated. " It's him, all right, the Caped Crusader. Returned from beyond the pale, that's what he's done. Apparently there's been a slight error, Batman? I'll explain, or certainly try, later, commissioner. Right now Robin and I are off to nail Mad Hatter. Mad Hatter? At a time like this who cares about that pipsqueak's inconsequential crimes? Any crime, no matter how large or small, Commissioner Gordon is a violation of a public right and common law and the criminal or criminals committing such an offense must be apprehended for the sake of all human morality. - You'll hear from me shortly. -Right. To the Batpoles. I guess the first order of business, Chief O'Hara is getting word to the presidential jet. -Right. NARRATOR". But even while the world pulls out of its tailspin the Mad Hatter's violating public right and common law. I told you, the perfect time for the perfect crime. Even the Bergama Royal Guards aren't here. Boy, that was quick, boss. But not quick enough, Jervis. I was down at the hat check stand, checking no hats, and guess what I heard. - What? -Batman and Robin are alive. How could you have heard that? I did, and it's spreading like wildfire, from the president at the airport to the satellite, to every country on earth. Wouldn't you know. I reach the peak of my career and now a petty annoyance like this. While at the same time Batman and Robin are back in their familiar haunt. Mad Hatter has to be someplace with that contaminated cowl. Ergo Ergo, the small bug I tucked in the cowl has to be someplace too. Is that a bleep? It sounded more like a splash to me, Robin. Which fits. My little gadget contained an Underwater Bat-sonar Device. Holy mermaid. Now let's see if we can pinpoint the exact location. Aha. A body of water at Spring and Lake Streets. The old Lake Street reservoir. Drained, filled, and turned into a housing project. The Spring Street Aquarium? Ran out of fish. We're not getting far. But it's a lot better than being departed and defunct. Defunct. I think you may have hit it, old chum. The defunct Green Derby Restaurant near the intersection of Spring and Lake Streets. And if memory serves me correctly there's an old elevated water storage tank directly behind it. Yes, commissioner? We've just learned a ruby was stolen out of the Golden Buddha on exhibit at the Gotham Art Center and replaced by the one taken out of Hattie Hatfield's headdress last night which incidentally was fake. No doubt the Mad Hatter's involved. But you don't know how relieved I am to tell you this, Batman. Relieved? At the loss of a million-dollar ruby? No, no, no. Relieved to know that you're back on the job. Thank you, commissioner. And we'll try to get that ruby back too. Well, old chum out of the sarcophagus and back into the saddle. Gentlemen, uh, would you care to check your cowls? We won't be staying that long, miss. And business doesn't seem to be exactly thriving. Well, we shut down immediately when we heard about Batman and Robin. A thoughtful gesture. But a lot of dust sure settled in a short time. Well, it's this location. With that, uh, water tower out back there, it's, uh What about that water tower? Well, it seems to attract a lot of dust. Let's level, young lady. Does it not also attract Mad Hatter and his equally mad henchmen? And are they not using this defunct restaurant as a hideout, with you as a pretty decoy? Where would you ever get an idea like that? From that cowl which Mad Hatter stole from me last night. You're Batman? Holy hoodwink. Or holy naÃ¯vetÃ©. Take your choice. Exactly, Robin. And when they saw the Batmobile pull up outside did Mad Hatter and his slippery stooges head for that water tower whatever the nefarious reasons? Sure, they're climbing it right now. That cowl, which Mad Hatter apparently forgot to decontaminate contains lethal radioactive elements. He must get medical help at once. Let's go, Robin. - May I go with you? -Yes, you can lead the way. Look, boss, Polly is leading Batman and Robin right here, straight to this water tower. Oh, Jervis isn't gonna like this at all. Or is he expecting you to play coy then innocent then frightened then lead us to him? You mean a trap, Batman. I think we should make this climb with even more caution than usual. Robin, stand back. - They're coming up. -So what? When they get to the top of the ladder I'll simply turn on my super-instant mesmerizing device in my hat, and-- Any other ideas, boss? Where's the rest of the gang? Hey, gang- Sic them. Sic them. Sic them. Come on, boys! - Where's the Mad Hatter? -Up there. Come down before you die of radioactivity. At least I'll die with a fortune. The ruby from the Golden Buddha of Bergama's forehead is in my pocket and I defy anybody to get it. And we'll accept that challenge, begorra. Gosh, Chief O'Hara, are we glad to see you. Oh, that goes double for me, Boy Wonder. That in Shamrocks. We got your call from the Batmobile, Batman. But the whole city has gone wild, celebrating your arising from the grave-- A waste of the citizens' time, energy and money, Chief O'Hara. - Where's Commissioner Gordon? -He caught the girl at the bottom and he's taking her in to book her as an accessory. Good. Well, then you can take over here. Yes, my pleasure. Holy multitudes. Well? Well? After you, old chum. Now that the tumult and the shouting have died down and the captains and the kings have departed I have a question. - Yes, Aunt Harriet? -How did you know without a shadow of a doubt that Batman and Robin were alive when the whole world thought they were dead? Yes, well, I, um Or you, Dick? You were equally emphatic. Well, Aunt Harriet, you see, I, uh I know you don't want me to divulge the secret, sir but I think the time has come to tell Mrs. Coop-- - No, no, Alfred. -Yes, sir. - To tell Mrs. Cooper the truth. -Alfred. - It is I who told them, madam. -You, Alfred? How did you know? Maudie, the cleaning woman at the atomic energy laboratory is my cousin Egbert's wife. And Maudie's always been sadly given to, shall we say, heh, exaggeration. But Professor Overbeck himself substantiated her story. Just protecting a bewildered employee, madam. So that's all it was. An idle rumor that shook the world. Well, perhaps it's just as well. At least Batman and Robin, wherever they are-- Whoever they are beneath those masks. --Must know with what esteem they are held in the hearts of all the people on this earth. 
NARRATOR". Morning in Gotham City. But a day that dawns brightly is no guarantee against darkening disaster. Olga. Olga. Olga, wait for me. Giddyap. Giddyap. Olga! It's the Cossacks again, sonny. Yes, ma'am. But this time, they turned down Market Street. The only thing in that direction is the Gotham City Radium Center. Radium Center? That sounds even more dangerous than trying to cross this street. - Cossacks. -Da, Cossacks, my little technicianski. Where is hot stuff being kept? "Hot stuff"? I don't know what you mean. Ossip, sharpen little technicianski's memory with sword. Please, don't. I don't understand. What are you doing, Olga? Light of my life, my little future wife. Forget rhymeski. She's hiding hot stuff. I don't know what she's talking about. "Hot stuff" is Cossack translation for radium, my dear. Well, why didn't she say so? Well, I am saying so. Now, hand it over. We want 2 pounds of it. -It's in the vault. -Well, then open it or I will let Ossip here egg-speriment with his technique on you. Yes, sir. -It's in there. -Get it. Is cool. ls not hot. - Is trick. -Oh, no. No, no, Olga. No. This is merely the lead case. The hot stuff is inside. And it's plenty hot, I assure you. Here, I'll take that. Unh! Thank you. Carry on. Carry on, my Cossacks. Commissioner Gordon. What? Two pounds of radium? And you're sure it was the Cossacks? All right. Thank you. Not them Cossacks again, commissioner. I'm afraid so, Chief O'Hara. They've just stolen 2 pounds of radium from the Gotham City Radium Center. Radium? What for? That's a question I intend to put to the Caped Crusaders. Right now. The Batcomputer's none too frisky today, Batman. Yes, it's possible a supply of radium somewhere in the city has been moved. And as radio-sensitive as our machine is, it just possibly could be affected by that. And it's lucky that you and Batgirl found us, Alfred. Otherwise, Robin and Commissioner Gordon might not be too frisky, either. Holy understatements, Batman. We would've been in the soup for good. Yes, commissioner. Olga and Egghead have just stolen From the Gotham City Radium Center? Yes. Not 10 minutes ago. The radium there is type number six, isotype 14 worth about $500 an ounce, commissioner. The entire theft amounts to only $16,000. . far below the usual scale of an Olga-Egghead caper. That's what worries me. I'm afraid this is only the first step in a much larger crime. We'll come right down. Let's go, Robin. What possible purpose could Olga and Egghead have for 2 pounds of radium, Batman? - I don't know, commissioner. -What about the water supply, Batman? Right. Oh, that's a favorite trick of Gotham City's arch-criminals, Boy Wonder. No, it would take at least 200 pounds of radium to affect the city's water system, Chief O'Hara. Perhaps they plan to construct some sort of a diabolical weapon. No, the quantity they've stolen is hardly enough to construct a weapon of any size, Commissioner Gordon. Holy anagrams, what's the answer? I feel it won't be long until they themselves provide us with a clue, Robin. Oh, I hope you're right, Batman. Oh, I can just feel them radioactive gammas and betas crawling up on me right now. Ugh. NARRATOR". And in the Gotham City Library, Barbara Gordon has a weighty problem. Unh! Talk about heavy reading, Barbara. This thing must weigh 10 pounds. It's a rare book on paleontology, Petula. Professor Dactyl wanted me to bring it to his office at Gotham City Museum of Natural History. You certainly know the ins and outs of this library, Barbara. I didn't even know we had this book. Well, paleontology used to be a hobby of mine. I'll take this to the professor and come right back. - I shouldn't be gone more than half an hour. -All right. Oh, hello, Miss Gordon. I see you've brought my book. - Thank you, my dear. -Don't mention it, professor. That's a very interesting fossil egg. Yes, a very interesting specimen. One of the very few intact fossil eggs of that era. - Aren't you afraid someone will steal it? -Steal it? Well, who would want to steal it, my dear? Well, there's a certain arch-criminal who has a well-known penchant for stealing anything even remotely connected with eggs. But it has no commercial value. An interesting scientific curio, but hardly worth anything. Except to the paleontologist. Perhaps you'd like to see one of our newest acquisitions. The fossilized thigh bone of a female giant saber-toothed tiger from Outer Sverdlovia. Which is just outside Outer Mongolia. - I can't wait. -Come along. Was hot behind fossil. Yes, was also enlightening, Olga. Heh, heh. Enlightening? What means "enlightening," Eggski? Instructive, informative, my dear. That young lady with the professor thought that I might steal the only egg-sisting Neosaurus egg in the Western world. Heh, heh. Forty-million years old. Is probably stale, Eggski, after 40 million years. Why bother to take it? You just leave the thinking to me, Olga. And me? You just look beautiful, my dear. Naughty Eggski. Sometimes you are such gallant. So now let's dispense with the flattery and commence with the job, shall we? But why on earth would anyone want to steal a Neosaurus egg, Barbara? I don't know, Daddy, but it's gone. And I'm sure Egghead's the one who took it. I agree with you there, but why? Has he stolen anything else today? Well, as a matter of fact, yes, he has. He stole 2 pounds of radium from the Gotham City Radium Center not more than an hour ago. By the way, Barbara, this information is off the record, of course. I understand, Daddy. Thank you for reporting this, darling. And assure Professor Dactyl that we will make every effort to get his egg back for him. Bye. Why on earth would anyone want to steal a Neosaurus egg, commissioner? That seems to be the question of the day, Chief O'Hara. - Do you have an answer, Batman? -Unfortunately, no. But I'm sure this theft is connected with his earlier theft of the radium. But how, Batman? I think a little session with the Batcomputer will give us a clue. We'll be in touch, commissioner. Let's go, Robin. Think they can crack it, commissioner? If they can't, who can? Sure and that's the truth. I'm afraid we're not going to get much help from the Batcomputer, Robin. It can't go back to prehistoric times. This is a problem for good old-fashioned brain power. We'll have to think it out. NARRATOR". While Batman and Robin puzzle over the problem in the Batcave another mind works on the same problem at the Gotham City Library. Robin, do you remember a Professor Willis Grimes? That radiologist who stayed at Wayne Manor about six months ago? Yes. He was here for a convention. And at the same time, he was working on a new technique of irradiation. I remember something about it, but it was pretty technical stuff. I didn't understand much of it. Yes, it was complex, but I think I think it may be the clue we're looking for. - Can you get in touch with him? -Unfortunately, no. Professor Grimes is out of the country right now. But he did publish an article in the Southeastern Regional Journal of Applied Radiology. - Yes, sir? -Alfred, can you locate the most recent issue of the Southeastern Journal of Applied Radiology? There should be an article in it by a Professor Willis Grimes. Just a second, sir. I'll see if I can find it. That's it. Professor Grimes. Petula, does the library subscribe to the Southeastern Regional Journal of Applied Radiology? We don't get it anymore. We had to cancel it last year when the city council cut our budget. That's right, I forgot. I've got to get hold of a copy of it. Who in Gotham City would have it? The only person in Gotham City who subscribes to more periodicals than the public library is millionaire Bruce Wayne. Excuse me, Barbara. I have someone waiting for this copy of Robert Frost. I've located it, sir. What is the title of Professor Grimes' article? Just one second, sir. Could you hold on? The other line is ringing. Bruce Wayne residence. Alfred, this is Barbara Gordon. Does Bruce Wayne receive the Southeastern Regional Journal of Applied Radiology? Why, yes. Yes, he does, Miss Gordon. Oh, thank goodness. There's an article in the latest issue of it written by a Professor Grimes. Can you give me the title of that article? I believe I can. Alfred, this is just between you and me. Of course, Miss Gordon. I have it here, sir. I have it here, miss. The title of the article is: "Revitalizing Fossil Forms By The Use of High-Energy Radioactive Energy Sources. " - Thank you, Alfred. -Thank you, Alfred. You're welcome, sir, miss. You think Egghead plans to revitalize that fossil egg and hatch it? Exactly, Robin. But that's impossible. You are going to hatch It's impossible, Eggski. That's what they told Fulton, Edison, and Casanova, Olga. All we have to do is pour enough radiation into that egg, and I'm sure we can get it to hatch. Of course, Grimes' theory hasn't been tested yet, but I'm sure it'll work. Heh, heh. And we will have real live Neosaurus. Yes, our very own. We'll control Gotham City and that ought to be enough dowry even for you, Olga. And then finally, we can get married. You hatch egg, I will hatch wedding. Egg-scelent, Olga. Egg-scelent. And think what those Dynamic Dimwits will do when they are faced with my Neosaurus. Did you know that the Neosaurus has 2562 teeth? Not counting wisdom teeth. What is such a creature eating, Eggski? Well, I'm planning a three-course meal for it, yes. Batman, Robin, and Batgirl. And for dessert, Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara. - Marvelous. -Ha, ha, ha. This Bat-geiger counter will not only pick up radiation, Robin but will tell us from which direction it's coming. Now that we've adjusted it to react only to the radium source stolen by Egghead we should be able to track down his headquarters in nothing flat. - Why didn't we think of this before, Batman? -Hm. Hindsight is often better than foresight, old chum. Let's go. You are hearing anything, Eggski? Nothing yet. We'll give it another dose. I'm gonna keep zapping it until it hatches. - I'm getting a reading. -What direction? - Northeast. Very close. -Right. Batgirl, how did you learn about the thefts? I have my own sources, Batman. So I see. And you decided on the same method of detection as we did. My counter indicates the source of radiation is in that warehouse. So does ours. Well, I guess hindsight is often better than foresight. I suggest we pay them a visit, unannounced. I've always liked crashing parties. You are swimming up blind alley, Eggski. - This is all waste of time. -What do you know about it, Olga? I'll tell you, I heard something stirring inside of this shell. - No kidding? -Yes, a few more bursts and we'll hatch it. Ha, ha. Hatch this, Egghead. - Little red mal'chik and Batgirl. - No. Bring her here. All right, that's enough, Boy Wonder. That was a slimy trick, you rotten egg. Of course, Batgirl. I have a patent on slimy tricks. Wait a minute, Eggski. Where is malen'kiy Batushka? Batman? He was probably too afraid of me to show up. Only these foolhardy youngsters are impolitic enough to do that. Does not sound like Batushka I know. That's because you don't know him as well as I do, Olga. At heart, he is a coward in the egg-streme. Batman has more courage in his little finger than you have in your whole cowardly body, you-- Quiet, Wonder Midget, or I'll have you cut off permanently. Now you all are about to witness one of my greatest triumphs. Here. You will observe a wonder of modern science. One more burst of radiation and that egg will yield a 40-million-year-old Neosaurus. A hungry Neosaurus, my little friends. I hear it. I hear it. The Neosaurus is going to hatch. Oh Oh! Calm down now, little Neosaurus. Calm down. I'm your daddy. I hatched you. You wouldn't wanna hurt your daddy now, would you? I'm your daddy. Olga and I are your friends. Aren't we, Olga? Yes. Eat those two. They're young and tender. - Da, of course. -Yum, yum. Lock the doors, Chief O'Hara. Lock us in. Begorra, I never thought I'd see the likes of him begging to be locked up. Take it away. If we attack it from different sides, Batgirl, we may be able to subdue it. Though personally, I think it would rather eat peanut-butter sandwiches than Gothamites. Peanut-butter sandwiches? That's right, Batgirl. You know your Neosauruses well, Robin. Peanut-butter sandwiches, it is. What an ingenious trick, Batman. Not so ingenious, Batgirl. It's impossible to hatch an egg 40 million years old but Egghead didn't believe that. So I used his disbelief against him. But why, Batman? Too many Bessarovian Cossacks around here, Robin. If I'd joined you in the fight, some of them might have been injured. So I arranged for Chief O'Hara to have this building surrounded. I used my costume to frighten them into surrendering en masse. Boy, I'll say. What about that burst of radiation that hit the egg when you were inside it? I was able to protect myself from the radiation by coating the inside of my costume with a thin lead shielding. And now that Olga and Egghead are safely behind iron bars, Robin they should have plenty of time to study their paleontology. She's gone again. For once, Batman, let's follow her. Well, Robin, with my head sticking out of this Neosaurus costume I might not appear like an ordinary run-of-the-mill crime-fighter. You know who was inside that Neosaurus egg? Batman. - He sure turns up in some weird places. - Heh, heh. But how did you know this? You can't keep a thing like that a secret, Bruce. The whole town's talking about the Caped Crusaders' latest coup. But how could Batman have gotten in a Neosaurus egg? Apparently, he hatched his own little plot, Chief O'Hara. Daddy. Pardon me. Do have some of my birthday cake. Hello? Skip Parker. I'm out at Gotham Point, Barbara. It looks like the surf's really gonna be up in the morning. Is there any chance of joining me? Oh, I'd love to. And I don't have to be at work at the library till noon. Good. We can catch some really wild combers out here. Great. Bye. NARRATOR". But what else is up at Gotham Point besides the surf? What else is wild besides the combers? Not that heartless hodad, the Joker. - Trouble, Joker? -Oh, none, Riptide. With the aid of this little two-way hot-dog transmitter I shall shortly be king of the surf at Gotham Point. Ha, ha, ha. NARRATOR". Will he? Will this green-haired gremlin take over the world of surfing or will he wind up in the soup? There's only one way to find out. Watch the next episode. 
Batman We have previously seen. . a day at school. A glass of milk. . Not milk, but money. Holy cow juice! It's easy living. Sounds like the Joker. Watch out, kids, the Joker is back of this. How true! What's he up to? An innocent jukebox. . Oh, yeah? Plunder by remote control! And in the Joker's workshop. . cheerleader Susie? A secret member of the gang? But what's the Joker's plan? And that night, at school. . Watch out! Ouch! Knockout gas! And inside this van. . . . a ghastly game. Three lemons win 50,000 volts! One lemon. . Two lemons! Short pause. . Hold your breath for the dynamic duo. . Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na na na Batman - Hey, boss, look! - What, what, what? The whole town, dark. 'Street lights, everything. ' Oh! Curses and criminy. What confounded luck! Gotham City is having a power failure just like New York. The cops. I don't like the twist this joke is taking. Get us away! Cheese it, everyone! Let's go, let's go. Strange, an abandoned truck. Let's have a look inside. 'Holy smoke!' Quick, cut us out of here before the power comes on. Of that's what we will be, just holy smokes! A mobile slot machine torture van. The mere possession of such a vehicle violates 17 separate statutes. And not a shred of evidence tying it to the devilish Joker. No fingerprints, stolen license plates. . You overlooked this, Chief O'Hara. A reel of tape? Right. The tape from our anti-crime recorder. Before setting out tonight, I equipped my utility belt with a tiny microphone and transmitter. 'Every word those criminals said was recorded in the Batmobile. ' But what good will that do, Boy wonder? I thought you said they spoke to you through a trick voice distorter. Tricky, commissioner. Tricky, but vain. They didn't realize that every human voice has its own private wave pattern. Private as a fingerprint. Astounding. Is it evidence? Can it be used by the district attorney? True, the courts won't accept it as yet. I think I'll take this tape to the Bat-cave. Run it through the anti-crime voice analyzer. Check it against the voice file. That way, we'll learn the identity of the Joker's henchmen. We might be able to follow one of them to the Joker's hideout. Robin's right. It's our only card. Let's hope it's a trump. I'm afraid the Joker may still hold the winning hand, Batman. Will the anti-crime voice analyzer operate without power? Fortunately, commissioner, the Bat-cave is equipped with an anti-crime auxiliary generator. Which automatically compensates power failure. Saints be praised. And the Caped Crusader's advanced technology. To the Bat-cave. Morning! Hallelujah. The mighty power grid serving Gotham City is back in action. And in the Batcave, deep below stately Wayne Manor. . Master scope circuit, A-Okay. Let's check the beginning of the tape. Right. That'll be Susie when we ran into her in the hall. 'Am I ever glad to see you two. ' - Perfect. - What'll I do? - Jump the tape ahead? - Roger. Pick it up at 12. 7. 'That'll be when we were tied inside' 'that grisly torture van. ' 'Oh, let 'em fall. ' The same voice. I don't believe it. Susie? Quick, both tapes. Let's run them again, back to back. 'Am I ever glad to see you two. ' 'Oh, let 'em fall. ' Holy Benedict Arnold, Susie! Our chief cheerleader. A member of the Joker's criminal gang! Is it possible, Batman? Steady, Robin. Steady, old chum. But how can it be? It's an old story, I'm afraid. Old as Eve and the apple. That snake, the Joker must have promised her some baubles. Led her astray. But what are we gonna do, Batman? It's bitter but it's a break. The first one we've had. We'll have to use it. You're right. Only how? Let's see, today is a school holiday, isn't it? Where does that cute little trickster happen to be hanging out? I know. The Easy Living Candy Store. It's on East 3rd, two blocks from school. Get set, Robin. Get set for an ugly job. No, correction. What? Not Robin. . DickDick Grayson, undercover agent. 'His job is to get inside that gang. ' Dog George to Batman, do you read me? 'Do you read me, Batman?' Loud and clear, over. 'I'm about to go in. ' 'How's the micro-TV camera working. ' - Push button for test pattern. - Roger. Bat-scope a-okay, Dog George. Rendezvous in Bat-cave at end of mission. 'Good luck. Over and out. ' Good gravy, it's Dick Grayson, president of the school council! A goodnik like that? Coming in here? Hiya, Sue-baby. How's tricks? I must be seeing things. I thought you spent all your spare time studying. Oh, sure, I used to, maybe. But, uh, who needs it anymore? You're looking at a guy who's seen the light, Sue-baby. Who's the boyfriend? Oh, my friends call me Nick. 'No kidding. What do your enemies call you?' 'My enemies ain't in no condition' 'to call nobody nothin'. ' Some joker, isn't he? Uh, you looking for something, Dicky boy? Same as everyone else, Sue-baby. Some way of making an easy buck, that's all. You, the ward of that rich millionaire, Bruce Wayne? 'What a skinflint. ' If I didn't swipe dimes from the butler I wouldn't even have cigarette money. Why, here Have one on me, buster. Oh, thanks, pal. 'I better pass this round, I already had two packs today. ' So, how's the easy buck setup? Got any leads? 'You know, he might be able to help us, Nick. ' - He's a real super athlete. - Oh, is that so? You oughta see him climb and stuff. Maybe I should introduce him to-- Zip your lip, baby. Introduce me to who, Susie? - Hey, you want a tip, buster? - Yeah. Oh, there was a cocktail lounge stuck up recently. These guys used that trick jukebox. Yeah, I heard about that. Some cute caper. Yeah, well, here's my tip. You go down to that same joint 'at exactly 3pm today' 'you might pick yourself some nickels and dimes. ' - Thanks, pal. - That's my tip. I'll see you around, huh? Oh, yeah, you'll see me around. So long, Sue-baby. Gee, Nick, what's the idea? Why, you gorgeous, dumb hunk of cheerleader. Couldn't you see? That guy is strictly a phony. What do you mean? Already had two packs today, huh? My blind grandmother could see. That guy never had a weed in his hand in his life. Good gravy. How'd I do, Batman? Good show, Robin. Darn good show. It's 20 minutes to three. We'd better hurry up if we're gonna trap them in that cocktail lounge. Right you are. Let's go. A trap indeed! But who's the mouse? For, in the lurid lair of that criminal cat, the Joker. . My favorite kind of joke, one which ends in a bang. Right. Now, what about Susie? Has she filled the milk machine again? She's just getting ready. Uh, Susie, sweetie. A special extra bonus. A half pint bottle of the most exquisite imported Canadian perfume. Wow! Canadian perfume. It's called, " Une nuit sans fin. " One endless night. Gee, that's like poetry. No, Susie, no. Do not open until after you've loaded the milk machine. Do you understand? Oh, sure, Joker, anything you say. You're just the best boss any crook ever had. Oh, thank you. Hey, Joker, it's 3:00. Batman's zero hour. Watch for the green light. Back! Everybody, back at the bar. We gotta have room to throw our Bat-arangs when the crooks come in for the loot. Ready with the coin, Robin? Ready. Zero hour. Put it in the slot. Roger. Batman's funeral dirge begins. I give him five seconds. Now! 'The joke's on you, my cheery booze hounds. ' 'It's a stick up! Hands up, you coward. ' Surprise, Batman! Quick, Robin, down behind the Bat-shield. 'Surprise and goodnight!' Holy hailstorm. You knew this was gonna happen. Or something like it. You see, Robin. You betrayed yourself in that candy store. How? Despite your boast, it was painfully evident that you're not a smoker. Nick must've seen you were working hand in hand with the police. - Gee, Batman, I'm sorry. - 'Don't be silly. ' It's to your credit that that charade failed. The thing now is to save Susie. - Save Susie? - 'Work it out. ' Why would an undercover agent try to pump her? Because I knew she was one of the gang. Right. And once they know that we know that young lady's life isn't worth a plugged lollypop. Holy murder! We gotta find her quick. Where? Back at the store? - School. - On Saturday? She'll be in the gym practicing cheers. Of course. Tonight, there's a big game. Woodrow Roosevelt against Disko Tech. Let's hurry, Batman. Bartender, a bit of advice. Always inspect a jukebox carefully. These machines can be deadly. Hello. Yeah. Right. Yeah, just a sec. He's right here. Joker. Joker it's for you. It's Las Vegas. - Pete, the Swede. - Ah. Hello, Pete, the Swede. What's the line on the big game tonight? The odds are 20 to 1? On Woodrow Roosevelt High? Oh, what a killin'. Uh, take a whimsical wager. $50,000 on Disko Tech. Yes, Pete, the Swede, you heard me. Disko Tech. Fifty times twenty. One million bucks. Oh, how delicious! What? Bet against these champs? The clown prince of crime must have slipped a cog. But wait. . 'One. . ' Disko Tech, hey Disko Tech, hey Fight 'em Woodrow Roosevelt Beat 'em Woodrow Roosevelt Woodrow Roosevelt Woodrow Roosevelt Fight, fight, fight Okay, kids, let's take a break. Huh? Gee, too bad that Magic Milk machine's out of order. Susie, stop. Give yourself up. Your life's in danger, Susie. The Joker knows we're on to you. He's discard you without mercy like an old shoe. Have you guys stripped your gears? 'Quick. Catch her. ' So long, dynamic duo. Poisoned. - Dead. - Are you sure? Yeah, I saw 'em loading her on a meat wagon from the city morgue. The Boy Wonder was bawlin' his head off. Oh, well. Well, it had to be done, my Bad Pennies. What's the death of a greedy little dupe? This life, at best, is one long impractical joke. Have a memorial cigar. Why, thank you, Joker. The brief shadow has lifted. I am my own humorous self again. What's the hour? Quick. Cameras. Disguises. It's time for my greatest strike. Okay, drop in. One more. Okay fellas, let's knock it off before we go stale. Right you are, Cap. We'll quit while we've got our sharp edge. Yeah, we'll beat 'em by 50 points. We'll do it for Susie, right? - Right. - Come on. The "out of order" sign's gone off the milk machine. Oh boy, it must be fixed. Hey, who's got a dime? Here, I got one. What the heck? This machine's been fixed, alright. Good gosh. These are next week's nation-wide pre-college exam papers. Complete with the answers written in. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Dear me. How disillusioning. The champs are cheats. 'Caught red-handed with the answers' 'to the nation-wide pre-college exams. ' The Joker. At the moment, merely an honest citizen. We was passing by to inspect this here school property which we support with our taxes. And imagine our surprise. We're not cheats. No, it's a typical filthy Joker's trick. It hardly matters, boys. Now, does it? When the board of education sees this picture with you holding the answer to those exams. . 'Ho, ho, ho, ho. ' Good gosh, we'll be suspended. We won't be allowed to play Disko Tech tonight. Oh, well. I'm sure the scrubs will do their best. The scrubs? They'll be creamed. Oh, so sad, so sad. And after Batman's lectures to you about honesty. What on earth will the caper crusader say? 'Ball players. 'Run for cover. ' Don't worry about having seen those exam papers. They're a fake. 'We planted them' 'and the Joker's picture doesn't mean a thing. ' We saved Susie's life by using the Universal Antidote pills in our utility belts. She repaid us by revealing the whole criminal scheme. Okay, Batman. Let's deliver the punch line. Tough luck, Bad Pennies. You're out of circulation. They'll melt you down in a pan. 'Holy new year's eve. ' He's got me in his famous trick streamers. Have a sneeze on me, Batman. No use, Joker. I knew you'd employ your sneezing powder. So I took an anti-allergy pill. Instead of a sneeze, I've caught youcold. That's what easy living gets you kids. Stick to your books. And good luck against Disko Tech. Well, I guess it's goodbye, Susie. - Goodbye, Dick. - I give you my word. I'll mail you the new cheers as soon as they're made up. You can practice 'em while you're away. - Gosh. - What's the matter? You've all been so nice to me. I can hardly bear it. Heck, Susie, it wasn't all your fault. I mean, with your unhappy childhood in a broken home and everything. No wonder you fell for that crook's phony promises. It's time, Susie. The chauffeur is waiting. Gee. Imagine being taken to jail by a chauffeur. The Wayne Foundation for Delinquent Girls is hardly a jail, Susie. Heck, no. There's teams and clubs and everything. I don't know what to say to you both. I just. . Thanks, Dick You're welcome, Susie. I'll have nightmares all my life, Mr. Wayne. 'If it hadn't been for that power failure' 'where would Robin be?' And where would Batman be? - Where would Dick Grayson be? - Huh? 'Don't think about it, young people. ' Just be thankful that life is. . . . filled with unanswered questions, that's all. Goodbye, Susie. Goodbye. Next week, Batman battles False Face. Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Batman Na na na na na na na na na Batman 
NARRATOR". Gotham City Central Park where the Dynamic Duo interrogate Frontier Fanny in Shame's stable hideout. Catching me ain't going to do you no good, Dynamic Dingbats. My Shame's got your Batgirl, and he ain't gonna let her go. Not till he's finished committing the crime of the century. - Which is? -Which is none of your business. You reckon she's all right, Batgirl, in the trunk of the car? I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere, Shame. - Yeah. Hi. - How do you do? - That's a good-looking six shooter you got. -Uh, would you like to look at it? I'd be mighty grateful, if you wouldn't mind. It's a beautiful piece of machinery. Yeah, that's a beautiful piece of machinery. How much is that? Oh, it's 69. 95. Well, now, 69. 95, that's too much. Do it shoot straight? Up to 300 yards. All right, in that case, stick them up. You know, I had a funny feeling you were gonna say that. Gang, hang him up on the wall for safekeeping. Come on. Get all that stuff ready for the great train robbery. Come on, come on. Let's hustle it up here. Come on, let's go. Come on. Will you put me down? I'll give you all nice presents. Will you stop it? What are you doing? Ooh, ooh! Shame, honey, you seen my ma? Yeah, I seen too much of her lately. I think we must've left her at the stable with the horses. Well, don't worry, nobody will notice. We gotta go back and get her. No can do, lover. By now, she's probably a prisoner of the police. Might as well give her up for gone. Honey, she's my mother, the only one I got. Yeah, I know. Oh, don't be like that. I know she's a battle-ax and an old owl, but she is my flesh and blood. Yeah, I was wondering about that heredity. What'd your father look like? - Oh, he was prettier than my ma. -Nobody could be uglier. Well, can't we try and rescue her? You want me to bust into police headquarters? That's like putting my own head in my own noose. Well, we could trade her for Batgirl, like a prisoner swap. No, that ain't no swap. If I swapped like that, I wouldn't have a pot to put my head in for a haircut. Can't we try, honey? Please? Please? Oh, you know I can't stand to see a woman cry. All right. I wonder if Batgirl is still alive. Who knows what that demented desperado will do. - Maybe he's just holding her hostage. -No, I don't think so. I think he has something else in mind, something infinitely more heinous. Otherwise, he would have called us by now. Don't you agree, commissioner? Huh? Oh. I beg your pardon, Batman. My mind was elsewhere. My daughter, Barbara, has been missing since yesterday. And while the welfare of Gotham City is important worries of my daughter's welfare keep invading my thoughts. Now, what? Please, what was it you were saying? How. It's Chief Standing Pat. He's one of Shame's henchmen. I-- No, Chief O'Hara. He's obviously here for a reason. Hmm. Let's hear what he has to say. Man with blue-and-white face speak with straight tongue. I come talk peace treaty with you. What are your terms? Shame willing to trade Batgirl for Frontier Fanny, even up. What's the catch? Shame usually has three or four aces and a derringer up his scheming sleeve. You no try catch us, we let Batgirl go with full scalp safe. - No deal. -That's fine by me. Her scalp look good on my belt. Just a minute, chief. Commissioner, I know how you feel about criminals, and I echo those sentiments. But Batgirl has been very valuable to all of Gotham City through her pluck and her heroism. I don't think we can afford to lose her now. And the alternative to this deal is death. Very well, Dynamic Duo, I leave the decision in your gloves. You tell Shame we'll agree to any of his terms as long as Batgirl is safe. Then you bring Fat Squaw to Central American pavilion at Gotham City World's Fair. It closed now. No one bother us. We meet when little hand is on 11 and big hand is on 12. Chief Standing Pat has spoken. NARRATOR". Meanwhile, back at the ammunition store Shame and his aides are celebrating their coup. Well, aides, that was quite a coup. What's the news, Standing? Batman agree to terms, but he no longer under spell of Fear Gas. Him heap, heap, brave, brave now. Yeah, we'll see how heap, heap, brave, brave he is. We're gonna dry-gulch them varmints in the Central American pavilion and after we get them out of our sombrero, we're gonna conduct what I like to refer to as - the great train robbery. - Great train robbery. And after that, we're gonna head west. I arranged powwow for when little hand is on 11 and big hand is on 12. - Let's see, that'd be, uh That'd be, uh -Eleven o'clock, Shame, honey. Eleven o'clock, Shame, honey. Dad-blame it, I know it. Now, now I got a plan. Now, I got a plan. Now, here's my plan. We're gonna go to the Central To the Central, uh - American Pavilion. -American Pavilion. And after we get there, we're gonna get there - We're gonna get there -Early. Early. And then after that, we're gonna-- We're gonna Bushwhack them. Bushwhack them. That Batgirl still tied up? She's in the trunk of the automobile. Good. All right, let's go. Come on, let's go. Tallyho. Are you sure he's Mexican? NARRATOR". But even as Batman and Robin race along the highway Shame is arriving at the Central American pavilion with deadly punctuality. All right, gang- We'll hide right here till them Caped Clods come moseying in. But no shooting till Mama's safe. Yeah, no shooting till Mama's safe. - Stop it! - Hey. Hold your tongue. I think I smell a bat. Stop it, stop it! Yeah, I smell a bat. Skedaddle. Skedaddle. You let me go! You finally got wise to it, you couldn't hold me. Not while my prospective son-in-law still has an ounce of strength in his crooked body. All right, keep your feet planted, Batboys before I put a picture window in your skull. You wouldn't shoot us in cold blood? Cold blood, hot blood, warm blood, makes no never mind to me. - Just pass over our Frontier Fanny. -Where's Batgirl? Don't make a deal, Batman. They'll gun you down. Get away from our Fanny. He'll let us have it if we do. Still, we can't hide behind a woman. I have in my utility belt a Bat-chemical which changes the physical property of metal and makes it 20 times heavier. Let's see how effective it is. Watch it, Shame. He's up to a trick. Doggone it. Doggone it, Batman. You cheated. You know we ain't no good in a fair fight. That's what I was counting on, Shame. Get away from me. Okay, come on. Let's get while the getting's good. - Come on. -They ain't gonna deduct our plan, anyway. We're two hoots and a holler ahead of them. Come on. Of all the rotten luck. Take heart, Batgirl. All is not lost. We'll catch Shame before this day is through. And truth and justice will win out. Are you sure the phone isn't out of order, operator? Very well, thank you. - Still no word? -None. And it isn't like Barbara to go off like this. I've had no word from her in two days. - I'm certain she's all right, commissioner. -How can you be? Just, uh Call it a woman's intuition. Batgirl. Exactly what did Shame talk about while you were in his custody? It's a bit difficult to recall. I was still under the influence of Fear Gas for quite a while but I do remember his saying something about the great train robbery. Hmm Mm-hmm. So we don't know which train he means. But there is one train that runs under Gotham City every night to pick up the cash from the subway stations. But it's mostly coins and the money is so bulky, it would be very hard for them to travel fast. Ergo, rule that one out. There's a mail train that comes into Gotham City once a day carrying a great many negotiable checks and bonds. You weren't around when we first encountered Shame, Batgirl. No, a mail train is not his modus operandi. I think we all need some refreshment. What would you be saying to some soft drinks to cool off your brows? On me, of course. Splendid idea, Chief O'Hara. I better be turning this one into the bank. Heh. It looks like it's been in circulation since the turn of the century. Chief O'Hara, that's the answer. - It is? -Today's the day when the government ships all the old money out of town by train to be burned. Old money that's tattered and torn is collected by banks and turned over to the treasury for destruction. That must be what Shame's been after. - We'd better get moving. -And fast. NARRATOR". But are you in time, Batman? Because, even now, evil events are being put into motion. This is my first run on the money train. I get kind of nervous with all this cash around. Not a thing to worry about. I make the same trip every month at the same time. Never even came close to a robbery. It's practically impossible. This train doesn't stop for anything. You know, they'd have to sever the rails with an acetylene torch to even slow it down. What if someone did stop the train? What then? No problem. This car is made out of 3-inch armor plate. It's impregnable. Nothing can crack it. With the possible exception of a 283-karat diamond drill. That Fear Gas works every time. Please. Please don't hurt us, mister. I'm a family man. I got a wife and kid. I'm a bachelor, but-- But-- But I wanna live anyway. Good. Oh, good. Good. All right, let's round up this dinero, partners. We got a lot of gravel to scratch before the sun winks down. We're too late. Please, don't beat us up, Batman. It wasn't our fault. There, there. Compose yourself, citizen. We understand. You don't have to snivel and cower. It's that dreaded Fear Gas again. Oh, this is terrible, Batman. Shame's flown the coop soot-free and we haven't got any clue to his whereabouts. Allay your trepidation, Robin. - Do you have an idea? -it's an extremely long shot, Batgirl. An appeal to Shame's inordinate egomania may flush him out. Meanwhile, let's administer these bravery tablets to these yeomen in order to counteract that horrible Fear Gas. What is this you're tinkering with? It's a skywriter drone, Alfred. I've programmed it to write a message across the sky. If we're lucky, Shame will see it. It's an invitation for Shame to meet me in man-to-man combat, unarmed. Yeah, doggies, I reckon I'm happier than a horse in a yard full of oats. - Ha-ha-ha! -How much you figure we got, Shame? Oh, about 83 million, give or take a hundred. After I get through weeding through this grubby stuff, we ought to still have over 60 mil. And how is this vast fortune to be allocated? Yeah he's Mexican, all right. Look, Fred, I got no truck for a man that talks 8 pounds to the word. Now, you talk English like us normal folks or don't talk, Fred. Get it? - Got it. -Good. - How do you plan on divvying up the spoils? -That's better. You and the chief get 1 million each. That ought to keep you in tacos for a while. What about me? Don't I get something for my troubles? Yeah, you get a rich son-in-law, Fan. Look. Up in sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. No, it's a message for me. "Shame, you are a lily-livered coward. Meet me on Neptune Ave in the deserted and condemned tenement district at high noon if you think you can beat me without your gang or your guns. Just bring your two fists and I'll bring mine. Signed, Batman. " Why, that Caped Clown. That's an insult. Darned if I won't be there. I'll be there all right. I'll be there all right and I'll knock out so many of his teeth, he'll have to eat his steak through a straw. Shame, honey, it's a trap. Don't go. You bet it's a trap. Only this time, we're the trappers and he's the trapee. Fred, get the police on the phone and tell them Shame is coming back. A man's gotta do what he's gotta do. That's why I deliberately chose that urban renewal area the one that's condemned so that no innocent bystanders would get shot up. You may get shot up. This town's gotta be cleaned up so that little children are safe and happy and healthy growing up. Well, in case something happens to me, I know you'll carry on without me. Chief O'Hara. In case something happens. - Commissioner. -Good luck. Thank you. Batgirl. - Batman, I-- -Don't say it, Robin. I understand. You wait until me and Batman is 20 feet apart then I want you to drill him, and drill him good. And I don't want just blood, I want gore. - Get it? -Got it. Good. Now you wait till you see the whites of his eyes through his slits. Good luck, Shame, honey. Dumpling, I don't need luck as long as I've got you. Couldn't you just get sick? Hey, Batman, you fake. Don't you ever smile? You look grimmer than a losing football coach. Perhaps I should unbend a little. Thank you for the constructive criticism, Shame. Your mother wore Army shoes. Yes, she did. As I recall, she found them quite comfortable. They're about 30 feet apart now. Now, get ready. I'm gonna keep on insulting you till you run out of cheeks to turn. If you need to be vitriolic, vituperative and vindictive, Shame, you go right ahead. Just as I thought. We've got to stop them before they fire. - I'll take the two women, you handle the men. - Right. A few feet more, Batman will have more holes in him than a Texas oil field. Now it'll be fair. What's wrong, Shame? Lost your nerve? How far you figure we are apart? Eighteen feet, six and a half inches. We're less than 20 feet apart. You hear me? We're less than 20 feet apart. You big sissy, you couldn't drive nails in a snow bank. Why would I want to? You ready to give up and admit I'm better than you are? What for? Because I'm gonna whup you. You're pretty handy with your mouth, Shame. Much more so than with your fists. Oh, no! No, spare me, Batman. I ain't nearly, nearly as ornery as I ought to be. - Boo! -Oh, don't! Don't! Don't do that, Batman. Stand up, Shame. You're not worthy of the name Shame. You're a sham, Shame. Don't ever cry on my tights or pull my leg again. On your feet, Shame. Shame, I look at you with a mixture of emotions. Sympathy and disgust. You're heading for the last roundup, Shame, because of your greed and your avarice. Otherwise, you might have realized that good, even though it's sometimes sidetracked always, repeat, always triumphs over evil. You were magnificent, Batman. That was some shoot-out on that deserted street. Some shoot-out without guns, commissioner. Shame had a gun, and the way you flicked it out of his hand was brilliant. It reminded me of that great old movie, Low Midnight or something. It's all in a day's crime-fighting. Have you heard from Warden Crichton, commissioner? Shame's back pitching horseshoes in the prison yard. But this time, rubber horseshoes. And Calamity Jan and Frontier Fanny are on police detail. - Police detail'? -Police detail'? Policing up the cells in the women's cell block, that is. At last, maybe things will get back to normal around here. Normal, Chief O'Hara? With that famed Yale professor of Egyptology back in his King Tut alter ego escaping from a Gotham City Prison's psychiatrist's couch to begin another cunning caper calculated to confound our Terrific Trio? Watch the next episode to see just how normal things are not going to be in Gotham City. 
Episode #2, "Home Sweet Hut" A hurricane is coming, so the castaways build one big hut to weather the storm.  GILLIGAN'S ISLAND  Home Sweet Hut  By  Bill Davenport  and  Charles Tannen    October 3, 1964  TEASER FADE IN  STOCK SHOT OF BEACH/OCEAN/PALM TREES - CREDITS OVERLAY  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON BEACH - MORNING  The skipper is sitting before a fire cooking breakfast. Gilligan walks on camera looking for something to do.  GILLIGAN Morning skipper!  SKIPPER Morning Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Can I help sir?  SKIPPER Sure you can.  GILLIGAN What do you want me to do? (PAUSE) I know, sit down and shut up.  SKIPPER What?  GILLIGAN That's what you always say if I ask if I can help.  SKIPPER I do!? Sit down and shut up!?  GILLIGAN Uh huh.  SKIPPER Well why should I say a thing like that?  GILLIGAN I guess because you think I'll goof something up.  SKIPPER Well of course you'll goof something up Gilligan. But that's still no way to talk to my little buddy.  GILLIGAN No it isn't. As a matter of fact I'm getting tired of it skipper. And someday I'm libel to jump ship. If we ever get on a ship again.  SKIPPER Gilligan you're absolutely right, and I'm sorry. But you know how I am. I spout things off without even thinking. But I promise I'll keep a check on myself from now on. OK?  GILLIGAN OK.  SKIPPER Still ship mates!?  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  SKIPPER Good. Well I'll get this breakfast ready for the folks.  GILLIGAN Skipper can I help?  SKIPPER Sure you can Gilligan!  GILLIGAN What do you want me to do?  SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN Sit down and shut up.  MR HOWELL (O.S.) Oh good morning there!  Mr. and Mrs. Howell walk on camera.  MRS HOWELL Good morning Gilligan, good morning captain, what's on the menu for breakfast this morning?  SKIPPER Fruit and powdered eggs.  MR HOWELL Wonderful, we'll have some powdered eggs benedict.  Gilligan looks up at the sky.  GILLIGAN Skipper it's starting to rain.  SKIPPER Rain? Don't be silly Gilligan.  GILLIGAN I just felt a rain drop on my nose. It's all wet!  MR HOWELL Oh that just means that you're feeling good.  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston that only applies to dogs!  MR HOWELL Oh you're so right I'm sorry boy.  Mr. Howell pats Gilligan's shirt  (CONTINUED) My, his coat IS wet.  MRS HOWELL I felt a drop of rain too.  MR HOWELL Yes you're so right Lovey.  GILLIGAN Maybe we ought to find a cave or something.  SKIPPER Relax folks, this is just a summer sprinkle. Believe me, when a real storm sets in, you'll feel it!  Just then a torrential down pour occurs. Mr. and Mrs. Howell try to hide under Mrs. Howell parasol. The skipper, now completely soaked, is still stirring his frying pan of powdered eggs.  GILLIGAN This isn't a real storm huh?  SKIPPER NOOOoooo!  GILLIGAN When do you think the real big storms are gonna start?  SKIPPER Gilligan this is just a guess, but I'd say the real big storms will start about thirty seconds ago!  Gilligan tries to take cover under the Howell's parasol as the skipper continues to stir the pan, which is filling up with water. He pours some of the water out and continues stirring as we...  FADE OUT     ACT ONE  FADE IN  FADE TO: EXT - CLEARING - MORNING  CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  PULL BACK TO WIDE SHOT - ALL CASTAWAYS  As the skipper starts to speak, we pull back to reveal all the castaways standing together, dress in some unusual outfits. The skipper is wearing what appears to be a horse-riding outfit. The professor is wearing a smoking jacket and ascot. Mary Ann is wearing a dress and hat from what looks like the roaring twenties. Ginger is wearing a beautiful fur coat.  Gilligan is wearing an ill-fitting tuxedo jacket with tails while Mr. and Mrs. Howell are wearing just another one of their many outfits.  SKIPPER Folks, today we had a little touch of bad weather. At this time I'd like to say thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Howell, for lending us these clothes while ours are drying out.  Everyone starts to express their thanks in an Ad Lib fashion.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND GINGER  MR HOWELL Here here! Glad to be of any help skipper, any time Ha...ha...ha.  GINGER (TO MRS HOWELL) Oh I hope it doesn't start to rain while I'm wearing your beautiful coat.  MRS HOWELL Don't you worry dear. That's one of those new drip-dry foxes.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  Gilligan walks on camera and over to the skipper.  GILLIGAN Skipper, these clothes are still wet!  SKIPPER Well don't bother me with those details Gilligan. Go over to the fire and dry them out.  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  GILLIGAN Aye, aye sir!  Gilligan walks off camera.  SKIPPER Now folks I think one of the first things we must agree upon, is a permanent building in which we will live. Right!?  Everyone starts to express their acknowledgment.  MR HOWELL I think that's a good idea.  CUT TO: GILLIGAN NEAR FIRE  Gilligan is holding some clothes as he stands near the fire.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper!? What are we going to hang these clothes on to dry?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER Gilligan don't bother me about that. Use your head for once!  CUT TO: GILLIGAN NEAR FIRE   Gilligan has a very confused look on his face as we...  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  SKIPPER Now I've drawn up a little plan, of an idea that I have...  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND GINGER  (CONTINUED) (O.S.) ...I think will be exactly what we need.  MRS HOWELL Well I think it's very nice captain, but I'd like to see some of the other models before we decide.  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  The skipper unrolls a large drawing of the hut he proposes. On the back can be seen some large island looking land mass.  Mr. Howell uses his foot to lift the edge of the drawing to reveal what's on the backside.  MR HOWELL (POINTING) Yes, I like this one here, it seems to have a functional floor plan and green is my favorite color.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER Mr. Howell, that is a map of Australia.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND GINGER  MR HOWELL Oh, do you happen to know how much they're asking for it? (LAUGHING) I hate kangaroos...  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER Now folks I've only drawn one plan so if any of you have any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.  CUT TO: GILLIGAN NEAR FIRE  We see Gilligan wearing Ginger's dress as he stands near the fire.  GILLIGAN I like it just fine skipper!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER (SARCASTICALLY) Thanks a lot Gilligan.  The skipper finally realizes Gilligan is dresses funny.  SKIPPER What are you doing with Ginger's dress on?  CUT TO: GILLIGAN NEAR FIRE  GILLIGAN Well ah...couldn't think of any other way to dry it skipper.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER That's using your head for once!  CUT TO: GILLIGAN BY FIRE  Gilligan is looking a bit embarrassed.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER What do you folks think of my plan?  MARY ANN Sounds ok to me!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND GINGER  GINGER I...I think it's fine. Could you build my place down by the beach?  MRS HOWELL I think we'd be more comfortable up in the hills. I love the beach but weekends, EVERYbody drops in!  MR HOWELL Yes a hillside hut! Looking down on the others!  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  Gilligan runs on camera carrying Ginger's dress. He's now wearing Mary Ann's red checked gingham dress.  GILLIGAN Here you are skipper, nice and dry!  SKIPPER Well don't give it to me, give it to Ginger!  GILLIGAN Oh.  Gilligan hands Ginger her dress.  GILLIGAN Here.  GINGER Hope you didn't stretch it!  GILLIGAN No, and Mary Ann yours will be dry in a minute.  Gilligan then curtsies to Mary Ann before turning around and running off camera.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER Now folks I want to get one thing straight. We are NOT building individual huts. The fact is we'll have one permanent building until we are rescued.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND GINGER  MRS HOWELL You mean all seven of us are going to live in one HUT!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER It'll be a lot quicker and a lot easier if we all pitch in and work together. Remember the old saying, united we stand.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND GINGER  MR HOWELL In a hut like that, that's the way we'll sleep too!  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  PROFESSOR I go along with the skipper.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR If that rain this morning was any indication, we're in for and early storm season.  SKIPPER That's right professor, and that storm might hit at any moment now, so we'd better get to work right away.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND GINGER  MRS HOWELL Well I guess the skippers right dear, we can build our house anytime.  MR HOWELL Yes but not...not like that one, you see I see sort of a...a southern colonial mansion with a...  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  (CONTINUED) ...BIG WIDE veranda sort of bamboo column you know, and we can plant the whole thing with mint!  Mr. and Mrs. Howell turn and start walking off camera still discussing their new home. Their conversation fades out as the get farther away.  MRS HOWELL I always wanted a vacation!...  MR HOWELL Yes miss Scarlet absolutely!...  SKIPPER Thanks for backing me up professor.  PROFESSOR Well it was the only practical solution at the moment skipper.  The professor walks off camera leaving just the skipper, Mary Ann, Ginger and Gilligan in the clearing.  ZOOM IN: SKIPPER, GILLIGAN, MARY ANN AND GINGER  GINGER We'll do everything we can to help skipper.  SKIPPER Well I really don't know what you ladies can do?  MARY ANN Oh Anything! I used to be a girl scout, and they teach you a lot!  GINGER I use to go with a boy scout and they teach you a lot too!  Gilligan comes running on camera with Mary Ann's dress.  GILLIGAN Here you are Mary Ann, real nice and dry!  MARY ANN (SWEETLY) Awe thanks Gilligan.  Mary Ann and Ginger walk off camera leaving just the skipper and Gilligan. Gilligan is standing next to the skipper, wearing the skippers cloths. We can see that the seat area of the pants is smoking.  SKIPPER Bye girls. Thanks a lot Gilligan. Well are my clothes dry yet?  GILLIGAN Little too dry skipper, see.  Gilligan turns around and we see the entire seat of the skipper's pants, and the back of his shirt, have been burnt away and are still smoldering. The skipper is about to blow a fuse when we...  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF ISLAND FROM FAR OFF - OVERLAY SOUND OF THUNDER.  CUT TO: STOCK SHOT OF STORMY OCEAN CRASHING ONTO A BEACH WITH THUNDER.

COAST GUARD WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO SMALL CRAFT IN THE AREA. (CONTINUED)  CUT TO: EXT - HUT CONSTRUCTION - DAY WIDE SHOT - HUT UNDER CONSTRUCTION  The skipper, professor and Mr. Howell are busy working on the communal hut. Mr. Howell is applying some form of black tar like water proofing material to the grass thatch sides of the hut. The professor is standing on a ladder working on the roof structure. The skipper is inside the hut helping the professor align some roofing material. We hear the announcer of a radio news program in the background.

The announcer can barely be heard in the background as Gilligan walks on camera carrying a bamboo pole with water buckets attached at either end.  GILLIGAN Hi professor. You want a drink of water?  PROFESSOR No thanks Gilligan  GILLIGAN Oh. Hi Mr. Howell.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR HOWELL AND GILLIGAN  (CONTINUED) Want a drink of water?  Mr. Howell holds up his oversize bamboo glass to indicate he's already taken care of.  MR HOWELL No thank you Gillian.  GILLIGAN What's that stuff?  MR HOWELL Oh a...it's for weather stripping the hut. It's a concoction the professor dreamed up.  GILLIGAN Oh yeah!?  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - HUT UNDER CONSTRUCTION  (CONTINUED) Hey professor? You know you're really great! I gotta take these into the skipper.  Gilligan starts to enter the hut with his bamboo pole/water buckets. He has great difficulty getting through he door way and bangs the buckets repeatedly, splashing water as he does.  SKIPPER Gilligan will you watch...  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  (CONTINUED) ...what you're doing!! We've got to have this hut finished by tonight! There's a storm brewing out there someplace!  Gilligan has a sense of fear on his face.  GILLIGAN Ohhhh!  Gilligan is still swinging the buckets around and finally hits the skipper, splashing water all over him.  SKIPPER (STERNLY) Thanks a lot Gilligan! This is the only dry shirt I had left!  GILLIGAN I'm sorry skipper. Are we gonna move in here tonight!?  SKIPPER That's what the plan is, we'll have to work until we drop! Now get that water in the barrel!  GILLIGAN Aye, aye sir!  Gilligan swings the buckets around again and hits the skipper with a splash of water.  SKIPPER (VERY ANGRY) Ohhhh! Gilligan will you put that water in there while I get some more palm fronds!!  The skipper walks off camera as Gilligan removes the wooden lid from the barrel and empties the buckets into it. After he's finished, he starts to leave the hut with as much difficulty as he had when he entered. He knocks down some support beams and in the process almost hits Mr. Howell with the wet bucket.  PULL BACK: WIDE SHOT  MR HOWELL Watch it, you'll get water in my punch!  Before he gets outside he remembers he forgot to put the lid back on the barrel.  GILLIGAN Uh oh!  CUT TO: CLOSE SHOT OF GILLIGAN IN HUT  He spins around, buckets and all to go back in. He makes it back to the barrel and puts the lid back on.  GILLIGAN That was a close one. Somebody could have stepped...right...into...the...barrel?  Gilligan now realizes someone did step into the barrel. The lid slowly comes off the barrel to reveal the now totally soaked skipper in a very foul mood.  SKIPPER Thanks to you Gilligan, somebody already has!  GILLIGAN I'm sorry skipper! But you shouldn't stand on it, it's too dangerous! I'll go get you a ladder!  SKIPPER Never MIND!  GILLIGAN It's OK, it's right over there by the door.  PULL BACK: WIDE SHOT  Gilligan comes out of the hut, looks at Mr. Howell as he grabs for the ladder.  GILLIGAN That's a real good job Mr. Howell.  MR HOWELL Ah...thank you thank you.  Gilligan grabs the ladder and gives it a quick jerk. All we hear is the professor as he falls with a loud thump.  PROFESSOR Aaaahhhhh!  GILLIGAN What was that!?  Gilligan looks back and sees the professor lying on his back on the ground. He kneels down next to the professor.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Professor? Did you hear something out here?  The professor has almost been knocked unconscious and is very groggy.  PROFESSOR What?  GILLIGAN Oh you're taking a nap huh? That's OK, cause the skipper will drive you till you drop! Go back to sleep.  Gilligan pushes the professor head back down and it hits a bamboo pole with a thump. Gilligan, with ladder in hand, spins around to line up the ladder with the doorway and hits the bucket of weather sealant, knocking it onto the head of Mr. Howell.  PULL BACK/PAN LEFT ON GILLIGAN'S MOVEMENT  GILLIGAN Oops! Uh oh!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP MR HOWELL AND GILLIGAN  Mr. Howell has the black tar like weather proofing material all over his head and is running down his face.  GILLIGAN Sorry Mr. Howell. I really am Mr. Howell, I, guess I wasn't looking.  MR HOWELL Yes.  With out saying another word, Mr. Howell takes his paintbrush and paints a mustache and goatee on Gilligan who then starts to walk slowly through the doorway with the ladder held at shoulder height.  GILLIGAN Probably the...stupidest thing I ever did in my whole...entire...life.  SKIPPER Yaaah!  Gilligan pins the skipper with the ladder against a bamboo pole and nearly chokes him.  SKIPPER (STRAINED) Do you want to bet on that Gilligan!?  The skipper pushes the ladder away and is ready to kill Gilligan.  SKIPPER (VERY ANGRY) Get away! Gilligan you...!  Gilligan runs off camera with the ladder. The Skipper takes off after him.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY  Gilligan runs on camera with the ladder in hand, and the skipper hot on his heels.  He heads out near the lagoon's beach area where there is a tree standing. Gilligan hits the tree with the ladder and twists around the tree at the end of the ladder. He springs back against some driftwood on the beach area and winds back around the tree in the opposite direction. In the process, he hits the skipper, knocking him and himself into the lagoon.  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF HUT EXTERIOR  CUT TO: INT - HUT - EVENING GILLIGAN AND THE SKIPPERS ROOM  The skipper and Gilligan are in the completed hut getting ready to go to sleep. The skipper is already in the lower hammock.  GILLIGAN I still can't believe this place is really finished!  SKIPPER Gilligan it's been a long day, why don't you hit the sack.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  Gilligan makes every attempt to get into the top hammock. He steps on the skipper in the process making the skipper let out a yelp of pain. Gilligan keeps falling out and landing on the ground. He keeps getting tangled in the hammock cords and is becoming increasingly frustrated. He finally gets himself into the top hammock, only to flip over and falls onto the ground.  SKIPPER Gilligan, why don't you try JUMPING into the upper sack!  GILLIGAN Good thinking skipper.  Gilligan tries to jump into the upper hammock and lands on the skipper, once again making him yelp aloud in pain.  SKIPPER Gilligan. Why don't you get in the lower sack. And I will get in the upper.  GILLIGAN I hate to kick you out of your own bed.  SKIPPER Well there's just not enough room for us both in the lower sack. Well don't stand there, help me up!  While Gilligan is trying to get into the lower hammock without much success, the skipper isn't having any better luck getting into the upper one. He gets tangled in the hammock as well, and flips over onto the ground several times. He eventually gets into the hammock as well and starts to rest. Gilligan finally gets himself into the lower hammock. The cord holding the upper hammock in place starts to loosen and the hammock, skipper and all, starts a slow descent onto the top of Gilligan. Gilligan is now trapped in the lower hammock and being crushed by the skipper.  GILLIGAN (LABORED) Skipper!  Gilligan is trying to get the skipper off of him, but is having no luck. Gilligan is saved when from somewhere else inside the hut when the Howell's erupt into an argument.  MR HOWELL (O.S.) You can have the bedroom all to yourself! I'll sleep out HERE tonight!  MRS HOWELL (O.S.) You can sleep out there tomorrow night too!  The skipper wakes up.  SKIPPER What was that Gilligan?  Gilligan is still trapped and cannot answer.  MR HOWELL (O.S.) I wonder if I might trouble you for my pillow!?  MRS HOWELL (O.S.) No trouble at all, HERE'S your pillow! And here's your blanket, and here's your teddy bear!  The skipper now hears the Howells and starts to get up. He swings his legs over the side of the hammock to get up nearly crushing Gilligan in the process who lets out a choking gurgling sound.  SKIPPER Teddy bear!?  GILLIGAN (GASPING) Air! Get up please!  The skipper gets up and passes through a makeshift curtain made from a blanket used to divide the hut into separate sleeping areas.  CUT TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT VIEW OUTSIDE THE SKIPPER'S AND GILLIGAN'S ROOM  The skipper comes face to face with the Howell's.  SKIPPER What is going on in here!?  MR HOWELL Well never mind it's a private matter!  MRS HOWELL It is not! And I want to know what the captain has to say about it and what Gilligan has to say about it and what the...  The professor comes from around an internal divider looking angry.  PROFESSOR When you get around to me I'd like to say pipe down and get to sleep!  MR HOWELL Well no body asked for your opinion!  SKIPPER Will you folks keep it quiet! People are trying to sleep in here!  Ginger then appears from around an internal divider.  GINGER Well you're no help shouting at the top of your lungs!  SKIPPER I'm not shouting at the top of my lungs, I'm trying to get some quiet!!  Mary Ann now arrives on the scene as well.  MR HOWELL Well if you want to keep quiet start with my wife! She began the whole thing!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL I began it!!?  MR HOWELL Yes you did!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Lis...listen folks why don't we...  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL Shut up will you Gilligan!!

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL So do we I'm sorry to say!  MR HOWELL This was a stupid idea from the very start! Tomorrow Lovey and I are gonna build our own little hut.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Mr. Howell remember what the skipper said! There's a big storm on way!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL And what does he know about it! Has anyone seen the sky!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  MARY ANN Oh it's as clear as a bell!  GINGER I think we've gone to a lot of work for nothing!  PROFESSOR So do I!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - ALL  SKIPPER Now wait a minute folks! Don't be fooled by a little good weather.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER We're gonna have a real blow alright!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL What do you know about it!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER It so happens I'm an experienced sailor!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL If you were an experienced sailor, we wouldn't be ship wrecked on this dreary island.  MRS HOWELL Oh darling, lets spend the rest of the night outside. I'm getting a touch of hut fever.  MR HOWELL You're so right, I'm going to take you out in the jungle where it's nice and quiet.  MRS HOWELL Oh darling!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR I think I'll start to work on my own place too!  MARY ANN Oh that's a good idea!  MR HOWELL Marvelous! Good idea!  Everyone is starting to talk over the top of each other.  PROFESSOR It's getting awful crowded in here.  SKIPPER Wait a minute! Wait a minute!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Now be practical! In the first place what are you folks think you're going to use to make huts!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL Wa...well first of all we'll start with OUR door!  MRS HOWELL Yes our door.  CUT TO CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  MR HOWELL (O.S.) My door.  GINGER And these walls belong to us! We'll take our walls! Come on!  MARY ANN That's a good idea!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR I'll be by in the morning for my roof too!  Everyone but the skipper and Gilligan walk out of the communal hut.  PAN RIGHT/ZOOM IN ON SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER I think they're making a big mistake!  GILLIGAN They sure are. Part of the roof belongs to Mr. Howell!  The skipper is upset with Gilligan's remark.  SKIPPER Oooooo! Gilligan I mean their attitude! They're all acting for themselves! We've got to function as a group!  GILLIGAN you're right skipper!  SKIPPER I wonder what's going to happen when those monsoons come?  GILLIGAN I don't know. Maybe they'll build their own huts so they don't have to come bunk with us!  CUT TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT - CLOSE UP OF DOOR  Mr. Howell walks back in through the door. He's surprised to the see the skipper and Gilligan.  MR HOWELL Oh! Oh!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - group  (CONTINUED) I...ah thought everyone was asleep.  SKIPPER We're turning in right now Mr. Howell.  MR HOWELL Well I...I thought I...I'd forgotten something, but I..I guess I was mistaken.  GILLIGAN No you weren't Mr. Howell.  Gilligan leans over and picks up Mr. Howell's Teddy bear.  (CONTINUED) Here it is.  He hands the bear to Mr. Howell who now takes on a child like appearance and hugs his bear and replies with a child like tone in his voice.  MR HOWELL Nigh, nigh.

I mean...I don't know exactly where I am skipper but I know I'm right here someplace.  The skipper walks on camera carrying a six-foot wooden beam.  SKIPPER Gilligan, you are standing in my bedroom.  GILLIGAN I'm sorry skipper. You want to come in and go to sleep?  SKIPPER No I don't want to come in and go to sleep!  GILLIGAN It's alright if you want to because I can go work in the living room. Like I did before I...  SKIPPER Gilligan I want you to come out and plain the ends of this cross beam.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  Gilligan tries to make his way out of the hut but is having trouble finding the door even though there are no walls in place yet.  SKIPPER Gilligan, what are you doing!  GILLIGAN Trying to find the front door!  SKIPPER Will you get out here and start working on this beam!  Gilligan manages to find the front door and walk to where the skipper is working.  GILLIGAN Skipper, how come this place is taking so long? Everybody else is almost done with their huts.  SKIPPER Gilligan, my father had two sayings that I shall always remember. Hurried work is worried work and a job not well done is not a well-done job.  GILLIGAN Skipper that's beautiful.  SKIPPER Pop use to say a lot of beautiful things.  GILLIGAN Was he a poet?  SKIPPER Not exactly Gilligan. Well pop, was kind of a world trav...ep...oh never mind Gilligan! Now start working on this beam, I'll get some more bamboo!  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  As Gilligan is beginning to work on the beams using a machete, Mr. Howell walks on camera and is in a bright and cheery mood.  MR HOWELL Ah...ha! Hello there Gilligan! Ha...ha!  GILLIGAN Hi Mr. Howell! How are things going?  MR HOWELL Well, I'm happy to announce the completion of Howell Manner, and I just stopped by to ask you and the skipper for a little plantation warming tonight.  GILLIGAN Is it ok if I wear what I have on?  MR HOWELL Oh yes...yes delightfully informal. I think you'll know everybody there.  GILLIGAN I guess I will at that huh? Yeah...  MR HOWELL Oh...oh by the way, might I borrow this machete, you see I want to cut some palm leaves? Mrs. Howell's making some drapes for the dining room and I have to go...  GILLIGAN Sure Mr. Howell.  Gilligan hands the machete to Mr. Howell.  (CONTINUED) Um...what time should we be there?  MR HOWELL Shall we say ah...five-ish? I...I think you know where the place is.  GILLIGAN Yes sir. Right behind that rock over there.  MR HOWELL Ah that's the place. Ta ta ta my boy he...he see you then!  Mr. Howell walks off camera talking to himself happily as he's gotten the machete from Gilligan and feels proud of himself. Meanwhile Gilligan has the beam laying on a makeshift sawhorse and is about to start work on it. The skipper walks back on camera carrying some bamboo and notices Gilligan not doing much.  SKIPPER Well why aren't you working on the beam!  GILLIGAN Because I gave the machete to Mr. Howell.  SKIPPER Gilligan did it ever occur to you to use the saw!?  GILLIGAN Yes sir that's the first thing I thought of.  SKIPPER Well why didn't you use the saw!?  GILLIGAN Because I loaned that to the professor.  SKIPPER How are we ever going to get this place done if you keep loaning our tools out!? Now I don't want you to do that anymore do you understand, that's an order!!  GILLIGAN Yes sir!  SKIPPER Gilligan, anybody that comes up and says anything to you, wants anything, the answer is no no no no no NO!! Now have you got THAT!  GILLIGAN NO! I mean yes!  SKIPPER Gilligan!  The skipper walks off camera as Gilligan is getting ready to get back to work. A soon as the skipper is gone, Ginger walks on camera looking as if she's about to vamp Gilligan. Gilligan is mouthing the word no over and over under his breath.  CUT TO: LEFT OF SAME AREA, PAN ON GINGER WALKING TO GILLIGAN  GINGER Hello...  GILLIGAN NO no N  O  NO!!  GINGER (INNOCENTLY) Gilligan. What kind of a greeting is that?  GILLIGAN That's the kind of greeting everybody gets who tries to borrow anything, NO NO NO!  GINGER Well, I didn't come here to borrow anything.  GILLIGAN You didn't?  GINGER (SEDUCTIVELY) No.  GILLIGAN No?  GINGER (SINCERELY) No.  GILLIGAN Oh.  GINGER (INNOCENTLY) All I want is just a...a, teeny, weenie, weensy, weenie piece of rope.  GILLIGAN How long a, little, teeny weenie eency weensy bit of rope do you want?  GINGER Nine feet. That isn't much is it?  GILLIGAN (WEAKLY) Well...no nine feet's hardly anything at all.  Ginger keeps moving closer to Gilligan as if she planed to kiss him. Gilligan, wanting no part of it, keeps backing away and ends up falling on the ground. He crawls back over to the sawhorses the beam is on.  GINGER This is awfully sweet of you Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Oh heck, it's only rope. Let's see now.  Gilligan stretches a length of rope from one end of the beam to the other, using the six-foot length as a guide.  GILLIGAN Six feet and, three feet more, makes nine feet, yeah!  Gilligan lays the rope on the beam he's been working on.  (CONTINUED) Ok...  He takes his axe and gives it a quick hard hit. The rope is cut in two and so is the beam which falls to the ground, as Ginger is startled into letting out a howl.  GILLIGAN Here's your nine feet of rope Ginger. Yeah.  GINGER (INNOCENTLY) Thank you Gilligan.  Gilligan picks up the two pieces of the beam that fell.  GILLIGAN And if ya...um, if you need a low ceiling, I've got two three foot beams if you want'em.  GINGER The rope is all I wanted, thanks.  Gilligan is fumbling with the two cut beams.  SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan!  Gilligan hears the skipper and panics. He quickly puts the two beams together and places them on the sawhorses.  SKIPPER I made a mistake with this six-foot beam.  GILLIGAN Oh...yeah...well that's ok skipper, everybody makes mistakes, especially with six foot beams. I think six-foot beams are the easiest things to...  SKIPPER Gilligan will you cut that out! Now I want to use this for a wall brace. Cut it in half!  The skipper turns and hits Gilligan in the back of the head with another beam he's carrying. Gilligan bends over and claps his hands together to make a noise.  Gilligan grabs the two three foot beams and presents them to the skipper.  GILLIGAN Here you are skipper! Two three foot crossbeams!  SKIPPER Well you sure cut that in a hurry!  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  SKIPPER Hand me that coil of rope.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  Gilligan coils up what's left of the rope he cut for Ginger. It's very short and only makes a very small coil.  SKIPPER Gilligan. (pause) You didn't remember to say what I told you did you?  GILLIGAN Yes sir. I said no exactly like you told me. Just before I gave away the rope.  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan! You see those clouds up there!  GILLIGAN Yeah they're pretty!  SKIPPER They're NOT PRETTY! They could storm at any minute! Now you go out, on the double and get everything that you loaned out! Hurry up, on the double!!  GILLIGAN Yes sir. (pause) Skipper? You don't have to worry. If it starts to rain, we can work inside!  SKIPPER Gillian! Now you get out of here on the double!  Gilligan runs off screen as we...  FADE TO: INT - PROFESSOR'S HUT - DAY  We see the professor sitting writing in a journal and Gilligan is standing in the open door way. Gilligan knocks on the doorframe to get the professor's attention.  PROFESSOR Come in.  Gilligan enters the hut.  (CONTINUED) Oh hello Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Hi professor. This is sure a nice place you got here. What are you doing?  PROFESSOR I'm making notes for a book.  GILLIGAN You mean you're writing a book?  PROFESSOR That's one of the reasons I wanted to be off by myself. It's going to be a chronicle of our adventures on the island.  GILLIGAN No kidding!  PROFESSOR I think it's a book people will buy don't you?  GILLIGAN Sure I'll buy one. I'm dieing to find out what happens to us.  PROFESSOR Fine.  GILLIGAN Could I have back the chisel and saw you borrowed?  PROFESSOR Oh yeah! I loaned the chisel to the girls, but the saws right here somewhere.  While the professor is looking for the saw, Gilligan is looking around the hut. He sees a small piece of grass sticking from the wall and pulls it out. The entire wall falls down.  PROFESSOR What did you do to that wall!?  GILLIGAN I'm sorry professor, all I did was pull out this palm leaf and the whole thing fell down.  PROFESSOR Oh come on!  GILLIGAN Honest professor that's what happened.  PROFESSOR Don't try to tell me that pulling out one palm leaf will make a whole wall fall down!  The professor starts pulling out a number of palm leaves with no apparent effect on the hut.  PROFESSOR (PROUDLY) I built this place you remember!?  Gilligan inspects another wall and pulls out a single palm leaf. As before the entire wall falls down along with the rest of the hut, leaving in totally collapsed. The professor and Gilligan are left staring at each other in a state of shock and disbelief as we...  FLIP TO: EXT - MARY ANN AND GINGER'S HUT - DAY  Ginger and Mary Ann are outside there small block like hut along with Gilligan who has been admiring their hut.  MARY ANN You really like it Gilligan?  GILLIGAN Yeah girls your place is beautiful. The professor had a beautiful place but...  GINGER Oh Gilligan we're going to have a beautiful garden here, and then we're going to...  Ginger then stops and starts sniffing the air.  (CONTINUED) Mary Ann, your fudge is burning!  MARY ANN Oh...Oh my goodness! Oh...oh!!  Mary Ann tries to open the door to their hut. But it's stuck.  (CONTINUED) Oh the door won't open!   GILLIGAN Here I'll get it, hold this.  Gilligan hands the saw to Ginger and goes to open the hut's door.  (CONTINUED) Here allow me.  MARY ANN Oh thanks Gilligan!  Gilligan goes over to the hut door and starts yanking on it. As he does, the hut starts to collapse. Mary Ann and Ginger see what's happening and start screaming. Eventually he gets the door open only to find a collapsed hut.  Mary ANN Oh Gilligan.  GINGER Oh...oh and after all that work!  MARY ANN AND GINGER Ohhhhh!  Ohhhhh!  GILLIGAN Well, at least I fixed the door.  FLIP TO: EXT - MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT - DAY  We see Mr. and Mrs. Howell's hut complete with Palm tree columns. Mr. Howell is waiting for the Skipper and Gilligan to arrive. The skipper and Gilligan walk on camera.  GILLIGAN Hi Mr. Howell.  MR HOWELL Well gentleman, we're a little early aren't we? Not that it matters, welcome to Howell manner!  GILLIGAN Mr. Howell built a real nice hut didn't he skipper?  SKIPPER So did the others Gilligan but it took just one little disaster to leave them homeless.  MR HOWELL Ah...what disaster are you talking about?  The skipper looks at Gilligan and Gilligan reacts with the look of embarrassment.  SKIPPER That's why we stopped by Mr. Howell. We wanted to talk to you about the community hut.  MR HOWELL You don't have to say another word. Of course I'll contribute! I give to community hut every YEAR!  GILLIGAN No Mr. Howell, the community hut the seven of us built.  SKIPPER And the five of you tore down! Now if we can just work together like we did before, we can rebuild it before the rough weather sets in.  MR HOWELL HA...ha...ha...you and your rough weather. I LIKE rough weather! I welcome rough weather! May I say captain that this place is built to withstand anything!  SKIPPER You may think it is.  GILLIGAN Yeah Mr. Howell, you may think it is.  SKIPPER Quiet Gilligan! Come over here and sit down and be quiet, I'll handle this!  MR HOWELL I assure you captain, this place is a veritable fortress!  Gilligan goes over to a hammock stretched between two of the palm tree columns. He sits down and the two palm tree columns collapse, taking the rest of the hut with them.  MR HOWELL Arrrrrgh! It's a veritable rock of Gibraltar!

Gilligan stops sawing and realizes that he's not going to be able to say no again and gives out a sigh of defeat. He starts by handing her the saw and then gathers the tools one by one from the toolbox and hands them to Ginger. He drops a tool but catches it in time. The toolbox, now almost empty almost falls but is caught by Ginger.  GINGER Could you carry the box please?  Gilligan carries the empty tool box and follows Ginger off screen as we...

Gilligan looks over the side of the hammock and down at the skipper. The skipper is fast asleep. Gilligan tries to go back to sleep.  Once again the ghostly wail penetrates the silence of the jungle night. This time prompting Gilligan into action.  GILLIGAN No, it wasn't you skipper.  Gilligan gets out of his hammock to see what the sound is.  PAN/ZOOM IN WITH GILLIGAN TO WINDOW  He walks to the large window and pulls up the blind.

SKIPPER Well...yes!  PROFESSOR Well then a...if you were asleep, how could you know that Gilligan was?  SKIPPER Well because he told me when he woke up!  PROFESSOR Well if Gilligan was asleep, how could he know that you were?  SKIPPER Well because I...uh...well, yes. If there's anything I can't stand its logic!  PROFESSOR Oh.  I should be able to figure out a logical answer.  SKIPPER A...what, sort of a sound was it?  PROFESSOR Well, as I recall, it was a...a mournful sort of a cry. Lets see, it was a...  The professor lets out the same type of ghostly moaning that Gilligan heard the night before.  PROFESSOR oooOOooo oooOOooo...

PROFESSOR Gilligan it's only me!  SKIPPER Gilligan for goodness sake!  Gilligan has totally lost it and is yelling over the top of the skipper and the professor. He even launches himself into the ghostly moaning he heard.  GILLIGAN OOOOooooo! OOOOoooooo! OOOoooooo! OooOooooo!  The skipper and professor are trying to calm him down. Gilligan continues to howl as we...  FADE TO: INT - SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN'S HUT - NIGHT  Gilligan is pacing around the hut looking very frightened. The skipper is lying in his hammock and is getting aggravated with Gilligan. There's a candle on the table acting as a night light for Gilligan.  SKIPPER Gilligan. I am trying to get some sleep! NOW can we turn out the light!  GILLIGAN I can't go to bed, I'm not sleepy.  SKIPPER Well then why don't you get yourself a book? You know reading always puts you to sleep.  GILLIGAN OK.  The skipper tries to go back to sleep as Gilligan makes his way over to the table to get a book. He picks up a book, stares at it for a moment and then tosses it over his shoulder. The skipper hears him and is now fully awake again.  SKIPPER Now what!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I can't read I, lost my glasses.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER You don't WEAR glasses!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Then how do you expect me to read?  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan!  Gilligan is trying to get the skipper physically out of his hammock but the skipper won't budge.  GILLIGAN Skipper, come on, lets go play some checkers.  SKIPPER I don't want to play checkers! I want to go to sleep!  GILLIGAN Let's play some cards! I'll let you win!  SKIPPER Gilligan, I always win!  GILLIGAN I'll let you lose!  SKIPPER Will you put that light out!?  GILLIGAN No sir skipper, when you're living on a haunted island anything can happen!  SKIPPER All right. All right, ALL RIGHT!  The skipper gets out of his hammock.  GILLIGAN I'll get the cards.  SKIPPER No we're not going to play cards! We're going to settle this ghost business right here and now!  GILLIGAN But skipper...  SKIPPER No arguments!  The skipper grabs Gilligan by the arm and drags him to the hut's door.  SKIPPER Now I want you to go outside. And I don't want you to come back in until you've counted to ten!  GILLIGAN But it's dark out there!  SKIPPER Go out and count to ten!  GILLIGAN Can I count to ten by fives!?  SKIPPER No Gilligan!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Fours?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER No! By ones! One, two, three, four, five,...

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER Gilligan, outside!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan reluctantly goes outside.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan immediately comes back inside and yells.  GILLIGAN TEN!  SKIPPER Outside!  Once more Gilligan goes outside and starts to count. The skipper puts on a white sheet over himself and takes up a ghostly stance. Gilligan comes back in the hut and sees the skipper.  SKIPPER/GHOST Helloooo Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Hi skipper!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER WEARING SHEET  SKIPPER Well Gilligan how does it feel to be cured? You walked right into the front of a ghost and you weren't even scared!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I knew you weren't a ghost! A ghost doesn't wear a sheet stamped SS Minnow!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER WEARING SHEET  The skipper takes off the sheet and is getting frustrated.  SKIPPER We're going to cure this ghost thing right now! Anybody in their right mind knows...  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  CONTINUED (O.S.) ...that there's no such thing as a...ga...eg...  We can see what the skippers sees. Out of the window, we see a ghostly apparition float through the clearing outside his hut.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER ...ah...  The skipper faints at the sight of the ghost. Gillian doesn't see the ghost and doesn't understand why the skipper fainted.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN, SKIPPER IS OUT OF FRAME  GILLIGAN Skipper! What happened? Skipper? I'll revive you, I'll revive you!  Gilligan runs out of the hut to get some water as the skipper is picking himself up off the ground.  Gilligan comes back with a bucket of water and looks for the skipper who's no longer on the floor.  PULL BACK TO: MEDIUM SHOT  GILLIGAN Where'd you go? Oh, there you are.  PAN LEFT WITH GILLIGAN TO SKIPPER  The skipper is sitting at the table looking rather shaken. Gilligan pours the bucket of water on him even though the skippers already awake. The skipper is not too pleased with Gilligan as...  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF HUT'S DOOR  Mary Ann, Ginger , Mr. and Mrs. Howell coming running into the hut.  MARY ANN Oh skipper! I'm not going to sleep in that hut another minute!  GINGER It's haunted!  PULL BACK TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP  MR HOWELL The whole island is haunted!  MRS HOWELL Skipper you'll have to put us up for the night!  SKIPPER Well but I...  GILLIGAN We only have two hammocks!  PAN RIGHT WITH MR HOWELL TO HAMMOCK  MR HOWELL Oh...only well! I've got mine!  SKIPPER Just a minute Mr. Howell!  Mary Ann, Ginger, the skipper and Mrs. Howell all race after Mr. Howell for the hammocks at once. They all verbally claim the hammock for themselves in an ad-lib fashion. They all try to climb into the lower hammock as it sags to the ground. Gilligan makes it into his hammock with no competition. The rest continue to fight for the hammock.  MR HOWELL A Howell is sleeping! A Howell is sleeping!  With everyone trying to get into the lower hammock, it finally gives way and collapses leaving a pile of bodies. Gilligan all ready in his hammock is amused.  GILLIGAN Good night everybody!  Gilligan puts his hat over his face as we...  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  The castaways have gathered seated around the table listening to the professor who is trying to find an explanation for the strange sightings.  PROFESSOR I just know there's got to be a logical answer.  GILLIGAN Yeah but does the ghost know!?  SKIPPER Quiet Gilligan. Go on professor.  PAN RIGHT WITH PROFESSOR TO MARY ANN AND GINGER  PROFESSOR All right we all think we've seen a ghost. But could it have been say a, a patch of fog?  GINGER Didn't look like fog to me.  MARY ANN Me either!  PROFESSOR All right, what about a cloud? Or a white sheet?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  Gilligan is shaking his head no.  SKIPPER Well I think it's possible professor.  The skipper looks at Gilligan who now is shaking his head yes.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Girls, have either of you notice a sheet missing?  MARY ANN Come to think of it, there is a sheet missing.  GINGER It was gone from the clothesline a few days ago!  PROFESSOR And that was just about the time our ghost showed up. Perhaps that sheet blew off the line.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  SKIPPER Why certainly! And it's been blowing around ever since! That's what we've all seen just a plain old sheet! Right Gilligan!?  GILLIGAN Right skipper. A sheet with arms and legs and a voice that goes ooOOOOOOOOoooo!  SKIPPER Stop that!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  The girls and professor don't agree with Gilligan and start ad-libbing their opinions together.  PROFESSOR It's gotta be a sheet.  GINGER It's a sheet it has to be a sheet.  MARY ANN It's the only logical explanation  The group settles down a bit.  PULL BACK TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR Therefore, find the sheet and I think you'll have your ghost.  Everyone but Gilligan and the skipper get up and leave the clearing to locate the sheet. Gilligan is the only one that's sure it's not a sheet and is still frightened.  ZOOM IN TO CLOSE SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  GILLIGAN (TO SKIPPER) I'll go with you.  SKIPPER No Gilligan, I think we can cover more ground separately.  GILLIGAN Skipper if I see that sheet first, I won't be covering ground, the ground will be covering me!  SKIPPER Yes, or I'LL be covering you!  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan is walking up a path towards the camera and stops at a close up shot. He's searching the jungle for the sheet, when once again out of nowhere, comes the mournfully eerie cry of the ghost.  GILLIGAN Did I hear somebody? I thought I heard somebody!  GHOST (O.S.) You, no, hear, no, body.  GILLIGAN Well that's good.  GHOST (O.S.) You, only, hear, GhOST!  GILLIGAN Ghost!?  GHOST (O.S.) Me! I, am, ghost.  PULL BACK AND PAN RIGHT WITH GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Are you a, good, good ghost, or, bad bad ghost?  GHOST (O.S.) Goooood ghost.  GILLIGAN Oh. Then how come you scare people?  GHOST (O.S.) Because people scare me! That is why you must all get off, ghost's island!  GILLIGAN Yes sir Mr. ghost I...I, we...we didn't know it was your island but, we have no way to get off.  GHOST (O.S.) You find way! You must all leave! And soon! Ooooooooooo...  The ghost continues it's eerie moaning as Gilligan turns to run away.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE - MEDIUM SHOT  GILLIGAN (QUIETLY) Skipper!

CUT TO: NEW ANGLE - WIDE SHOT  Gilligan is running at full speed towards the lagoon.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON BEACH - DAY  WIDE SHOT  The skipper is standing looking at a long boat that has mysteriously shown up on the lagoon's North beach.  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Skipper! Skipper skipper!

Food, water, compass!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Everything to help us sail home!  GILLIGAN Yeah after all this time on the island it'll feel good to be on dry land again.  SKIPPER Yes! Gilligan, this IS dry land.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Yeah but it's surrounded by wet!  SKIPPER Oh never mind. Now lets get up to the others and tell'em about the boat. Just can't get over the fact that a ghost gave us a boat.  GILLIGAN Well maybe he didn't.  SKIPPER He what!?  GILLIGAN Maybe it's a GHOST ship. Maybe it's not really here!  SKIPPER Well of course it's really here! Can't you see it!?  GILLIGAN Yeah, but maybe we only THINK we can see it.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan touches the boat.  GILLIGAN It feels like a boat.  SKIPPER It IS a boat Gilligan! Now I'll go up and tell the Howells and the professor.

GILLIGAN OK, but I sure hope they don't catch cold!  FADE TO: INT - GINGER AND MARY ANN'S HUT - DAY  Gilligan is in the girls hut and has told them of the boat left by the ghost. Ginger is sitting looking at herself in a hand mirror while Mary Ann is standing, listening to Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Whenever you're ready we can leave.  GINGER Gilligan you're sure that you and skipper saw the a...boat didn't you?  GILLIGAN Uh...huh we both touched it to make sure it was real.  MARY ANN Oh in that case I'll be packed in five minutes!  GILLIGAN Oh wait a minute! Aren't you scared to go on a boat that's been left by a ghost!?  GINGER Oh Gilligan if a witch came on this island I'd fight her for the broom!  GILLIGAN And another thing, the skipper told me to tell everybody else including you, to bring your um...bare essentials.  GINGER I'd be happy to.  MARY ANN Me too.  GILLIGAN Oh, ok I'll keep my eyes closed.  Gilligan makes a quick exit from their hut as Ginger and Mary Ann are left with a confused look on their face.  FLIP TO: INT - MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT - DAY  MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  The skipper is in the Howell's hut, and has told them of the boat left by the ghost.

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND MR HOWELL  MR HOWELL All right, we'll just have to get along with these two little kits that's all.  Mr. Howell is pointing to two large trunks.  SKIPPER Oh come on Mr. Howell. There's nothing in those trunks that we actually need for survival!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL Well there most certainly is! There's my fox and my leopard and my chinchilla and my mink and my sable...  MR HOWELL My money!  SKIPPER One more word and I leave you!  The skipper turns and walks off camera as Mr. Howell is just about to continue the argument. Mrs. Howell steps in and physically closes MR. Howells mouth.  MRS HOWELL Thurston!  FADE TO: EXT - MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT - DAY  The skipper and Gilligan are walking next to the Howell's hut, and stop near the communal table as they wait for the other castaways to arrive.

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN What do we care, we don't go anywhere near Denmark!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL Thurston you're right, they don't say what they mean.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Now consider this. First someone tries to frighten us off the island. Then when they discover we can't leave, they provide us with a boat! Why!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I know, so we can leave! Lets go everybody!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL Ah don't you see Gilligan, it's a traup.

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND GINGER  PAN LEFT WITH SKIPPER TO GILLIGAN AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER But, come to think of it, we haven't sailed in it. Maybe this ghost not only wants us off the island, maybe he wants us dead!  PROFESSOR That is a strong possibility!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN AND GINGER  MARY ANN Well why would he want a thing like that!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR I'm not sure what his motive is, but just to be on the safe side, I propose we send the boat out first with a dummy aboard.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Oh no! Oh no! I'm not going out there alone!  SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan stop that!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN AND GINGER  GINGER But what if it's safe!?

GILLIGAN You should a gone to the other side of the island and got a jumbo size one.  Gilligan is stuffing the pants of the skipper's dummy with large quantities of jungle grass.  SKIPPER I don't think that's very funny.  GILLIGAN All I meant was, you're a big guy, and, you got a big head...  SKIPPER Gilligan!  GILLIGAN ...and a big heart.  Gilligan grabs more jungle grass from a table.  SKIPPER Thank you. Well, never mind Gilligan. I'll...I'll end up using a gourd I guess.

You must be tired. SKIPPER (drowsily) I am. That's why I'd like to get some sleep, Gilligan. Good night. Skipper closes his eyes. GILLIGAN Good night, Skipper.

GILLIGAN When will we talk about it? SKIPPER (frustrated) Gilligan, we'll talk about it in the morning, okay? GILLIGAN Okay. SKIPPER Good night. GILLIGAN Good night. That sure was a beautiful fish. Boy, it must've weighed a hundred pounds. You see the way it leaped out of the water and dove down to the bottom. The way you reeled him in and played him out. And reeled him in and played him out. Too bad you lost him. SKIPPER (angrily) Gilligan, not another word about that fish. Not another word about anything. Now go to sleep! GILLIGAN Good night. HUT WINDOW through which a gorilla appears. He moves up to the window and grasps the bars over the window and peers in to the hut. BACK TO SCENE A gorilla-shaped shadow appears across Gilligan's face.

HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT The MR. HOWELL and MRS. HOWELL sleep in their beds. On the night stand sits a large jeweled brooch. A gorilla appears at the window over their night stand. It looks in the window and spots the jeweled brooch. As it reaches for it, Mrs. Howell turns over in her sleep. She touches the Gorilla's arm. MRS HOWELL Darling, you need a shave. The GORILLA is startled that she touched him and he GRUNTS. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) And you say you never snore. Mrs. Howell rolls back over. The gorilla picks up the brooch and examines it. He keeps the brooch and disappears. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Mr. Howell, on his hands and knees, looks under his bed for the missing brooch. Having searched, he stands up. MR HOWELL Well, it's -- it's not on the floor. Are you sure you didn't wear it to bed, darling? MRS HOWELL Oh, no, dear. I know I left it on that nightstand. It is insured, isn't it? MR HOWELL Well, that won't do us any good financially. MRS HOWELL Why not? MR HOWELL We own the insurance company. MRS HOWELL Yes, of course. But, darling, I'd be heartbroken anyway if we didn't find it. After all, you gave it to me as a wedding present. MR HOWELL Yes, it has been in the family for generations. It's a piece of jewelry Queen Isabella gave to Columbus. Mr. Howell folds his arms across his chest. MRS HOWELL But you never told me that. How did it get in the Howell family? MR HOWELL Well, I'm not sure. They must have foreclosed the mortgage on the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. You did have it on at dinnertime. MRS HOWELL Yes. Don't you know, you had to change your seat because it was reflecting the evening sun. MR HOWELL Yes, forty-eight karats does throw a glare. Besides, it kept melting the butter. Are you sure you didn't wear it after that? MRS HOWELL No, no, no. I know I left it on that nightstand. Mrs. Howell walks over to the night stand. MR HOWELL Well, don't panic, darling. We'll find it somewhere. Mr. Howell joins her and continues the search for the missing brooch. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY MED. SHOT - GILLIGAN Gilligan kneels at a small fire. Over the fire is a wire grill on which sits a small frying pan. Gilligan holds two plates with stacks of pancakes. One stack is tall. The other is short. Gilligan uses a spatula to remove a pancake from the frying pan. GILLIGAN Skipper, you want syrup? SKIPPER (O.S.) Sure. FOLLOW Gilligan has he stands and carries the plates over to a nearby tree. The tree has a tap, which is corked. Gilligan removes the cork from the tap. Tree sap gushes out. Gilligan moves the plates to catch the tree sap on the pancakes. The stream of sap quickly slows to a dribble. Gilligan hits the bark of the tree. GILLIGAN This tree needs a refill. Gilligan replaces the cork. Gilligan carries the plates of pancakes over the table where Skipper sits. Gilligan places the plate with the small stack of pancakes in front of Skipper and the plate with the large stack of pancakes in front of himself. SKIPPER I sure am hungry. Skipper observes that Gilligan gave himself the large stack of pancakes. GILLIGAN Yeah. SKIPPER Well, if I ate like that, I'd see gorillas at night, too. Gilligan exchanges the plates. GILLIGAN Oh, uh, be my guest. Skipper smiles at him. GILLIGAN (cont'd) But I did see a gorilla. SKIPPER And I tell you, you didn't. GILLIGAN I did. SKIPPER You didn't. GILLIGAN I did. SKIPPER You didn't. GILLIGAN I did. SKIPPER All right, you did. Gilligan is unnerved. GILLIGAN Would you please go back to "didn't"? Gilligan notices something emerging from the jungle and hides under the table. GILLIGAN (cont'd) It's the gorilla! GINGER AND MARY ANN emerge from the jungle. Each carries a basket with berries. Ginger's basket contains blueberries and Mary Ann's basket contains blackberries. PULL BACK to reveal Skipper and the table. GINGER Morning, Skipper. MARY ANN Morning, Skipper! GINGER I picked some blueberries for breakfast. MARY ANN I picked some blackberries, too. Gilligan pokes his head out from under the table. SKIPPER You're just in time, girls. I was about to give Gilligan the raspberry. GILLIGAN I think I'll go get some coconut milk for the pancakes. Gilligan exits. GINGER What's the matter with Gilligan, Skipper? Skipper scowls in frustration. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan walks through the jungle looking up at coconut trees to find a suitable one. He finds one and shakes it. GORILLA looks toward Gilligan through the jungle undergrowth. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan jumps and tries to reach the tree's coconuts. He can't reach them and tries shaking the tree again. A coconut drops from the tree and hits Gilligan on the head. Gilligan winces, grabs his head, turns around to look for the fallen coconut, walks over to it, and crouches down to pick it up. As he picks it up, the gorilla spreads the leaves of the plant he's hiding behind. The gorilla releases the leaves and conceals himself. GILLIGAN drops the coconut and spreads the leaves. He peers into the plant leaves. The gorilla stares back at Gilligan. The gorilla ducks out of view as Gilligan releases the leaves and turns away, not believing what he's seen. GILLIGAN Please be a dream. Please. Gilligan spreads the leaves again and sees the gorilla. The GORILLA GRUNTS. The gorilla disappears from view as Gilligan releases the leaves. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper! Skipper! Ski-- Gilligan charges toward the jungle path, but the gorilla emerges from the jungle there. Gilligan turns around quickly but the gorilla grabs him by the shoulders. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper! Skipper! Gilligan protects himself by turning his back to the gorilla. The gorilla pushes Gilligan face-first against the coconut tree. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann, Skipper, and Ginger enjoy breakfast at the small square table. The girls eat berries while Skipper drinks from a coconut cup. GILLIGAN (O.S.) Skipper! Skipper! The girls look toward the jungle. Skipper is annoyed. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY The gorilla has Gilligan pinned face-first to the coconut tree. GILLIGAN Skipper! Skipper! Skipper! The gorilla retreats into the jungle. A large palm leaf touches Gilligan's neck. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann, Skipper, and Ginger enjoy breakfast at the small square table. GILLIGAN (O.S.) Skipper! SKIPPER Gilligan. He can't even pick coconuts by himself. Skipper rises and walk toward the jungle path to find Gilligan. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY MED. SHOT - GILLIGAN Gilligan stands face-first against the coconut tree. The large palm leaf touches his neck. FOLLOW Skipper as he walks along the jungle path. SKIPPER Little buddy, where are you? GILLIGAN (O.S.) Skipper! Skipper! SKIPPER Gilligan! Skipper runs toward Gilligan. Skipper finds Gilligan standing face-first against the coconut tree with a large palm leaf at his neck. GILLIGAN (to absent gorilla) You better watch out because I'm the Skipper's buddy and he'll take you apart. (to Skipper) Skipper! Skipper casually walks around the tree so Gilligan can see him and leans against the coconut tree. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Watch out, Skipper, he's mean and vicious! SKIPPER Who is mean and vicious? GILLIGAN The gorilla. Skipper looks around and doesn't see a gorilla. SKIPPER What gorilla? GILLIGAN The gorilla that's got me pinned by the neck against the tree. Skipper shakes the palm leaf to show Gilligan what has him "pinned" to the tree. SKIPPER Gilligan, a palm leaf has you by the neck. GILLIGAN He was here, Skipper. He's big, black, and furry, and goes -- Gilligan growls like a gorilla. SKIPPER Gilligan, stop that! First you see gorillas in your sleep. Now you're seeing them in the daytime. What you need is a psychiatrist. GILLIGAN I bet if I see one, he has long, hairy arms. Frustrated, Skipper walks toward the jungle path. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hey, wait for me. Gilligan follows Skipper. SKIPPER Gilligan. Skipper mutters as he walks on the jungle path toward camp. SKIPPER (cont'd) Can't even pick coconuts on your own. EXT. CAMP - DAY FOLLOW Skipper and Gilligan as they walk into camp from the jungle path. PULL BACK to reveal Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL We've searched the hut three times, and it's still missing. PULL BACK to reveal PROFESSOR and Ginger sitting at the small square table. A large bowl of berries sits on the table between Professor and Ginger. Mary Ann stands nearby. GINGER We'll be glad to help you look for it, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL That is not the point, Ginger. Skipper and Gilligan join the group. MARY ANN (to Skipper and Gilligan) Mrs. Howell's diamond brooch has been missing since last night. GILLIGAN How can such a big thing like that disappear? MR HOWELL The brooch is not where Missus Howell put it. It is not in our hut. Now, do I make myself clear? PROFESSOR Are you suggesting that one of us took it? MR HOWELL I'm not suggesting anything like that. However, that might not be such a bad suggestion. PROFESSOR Mister Howell, we don't have to listen to such an accusation. Professor rises from the table and exits. SKIPPER And that goes for me, too. Skipper exits. MARY ANN I'm surprised at you, Mister Howell. Mary Ann exits. GINGER "None proclaim their innocence so loudly as the guilty." I don't know if that fits, but it's from a movie I was in. Ginger rises from the table and exits. GILLIGAN Mister Howell, I'm sure I didn't take it. I'm even sure the others didn't. MR HOWELL Well, the fact is the brooch is still missing. GILLIGAN Well, maybe Missus Howell lost it. MR HOWELL She's absolutely sure she put it on the night side table. She's one hundred percent positive. She's one hundred percent absolutely certain. However, maybe she made a mistake. In that case, I'd better apologize. GILLIGAN Should I tell them? MR HOWELL No, no. I'll do better than that, Gilligan. I'll make an offer of a reward to anyone who finds it. GILLIGAN A reward? MR HOWELL That's right. Ten thousand dollars. GILLIGAN Ten thousand dollars? Oh! Gilligan turns and exits. MR HOWELL Maybe I should've made it five. (laughs) It's deductible. FLIP TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper paces. Gilligan sits on the table. SKIPPER I won't talk to him again as long as I live. GILLIGAN But he said he was sorry. Skipper stops pacing. SKIPPER Well, just because he's rich, doesn't mean he can push people around. GILLIGAN He apologized. SKIPPER So what? He apologized. Skipper folds his arms across his chest. Gilligan stands. GILLIGAN Not only that. He offered a reward to anyone who finds the diamond: ten thousand dollars. SKIPPER Ten thousand dollar reward? Well, of course, little buddy. What kind of a man would I be if I didn't accept his apology? Skipper walks toward the door and steps on Gilligan's foot. GILLIGAN Ow. Gilligan sits back on the table and grabs his foot to sooth it. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Professor kneels. PROFESSOR (to Gilligan) Apologized? He retrieves a turtle egg from its nest and stands. He hands Mary Ann and then Ginger a turtle egg each. PROFESSOR (cont'd) (to Mary Ann and Ginger) Here's another turtle egg. GINGER When I think of it, it makes my blood boil. MARY ANN How he could accuse us, is beyond me. GILLIGAN He said he's sorry. PROFESSOR There are times when it's too late to be sorry. GINGER This is one such time. PROFESSOR Nothing he says can make me forgive him. Professor kneels again to look for more turtle eggs in the nest. GINGER Me, either. MARY ANN If you want to associate with him it's your business, but leave us out of it. GILLIGAN Okay, I won't tell you about the reward for the diamond. Ten thousand dollars. Professor quickly stands up. PROFESSOR/GINGER/MARY ANN Ten thousand dollars? Professor, Ginger, and then Mary Ann hand all of their eggs to Gilligan and exit, leaving Gilligan holding all of the turtle eggs. Since there are too many for him to hold, he drops a few on the ground and makes a face at the mess. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Ginger, Mary Ann, and Professor walk along a path in the jungle looking for Mrs. Howell's brooch. Ginger notices something shiny. GINGER There it is! She runs over to the shiny thing and picks it up. After quickly examining it, she's disappointed that it is not Mrs. Howell's brooch. GINGER (cont'd) Why does coral have to gleam like that? Ginger tosses it away. They continue looking for the missing jewelry. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY The gorilla knuckles along the jungle path. He hears people coming down the path and hides off the path. Skipper and Gilligan walk along the path. SKIPPER Now, if they went to the spring before they went to bed they would've had to come this way. They stop walking. GILLIGAN I hope we find it because if we do, we can get a new car, a sixty-foot yacht, and build a whole new marina. SKIPPER Gilligan, ten thousand dollars wouldn't be a down payment for any of those things. GILLIGAN Well, let's not look for it then. Gilligan turns around to head back up the path, but Skipper stops him. SKIPPER Come here. Ten thousand dollars will help us pay for a new boat for us. And start looking. Gilligan and Skipper scan the ground for the brooch. The gorilla emerges from the jungle growth and follows the men. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY Gilligan walks along the jungle path. Skipper follows somewhat behind him but veers off the path Gilligan follows. The gorilla catches up to Gilligan and walks closely behind Gilligan. GILLIGAN I'll say one thing, Skipper. I don't care how much the reward was. Gilligan senses there is something behind him and stops walking. The gorilla hides in the jungle underbrush. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I wouldn't be out here alone with a gorilla on the loose. Gilligan spins around to find an empty path behind him. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper! Skipper! Skipper quickly appears beside Gilligan. SKIPPER What's the matter, Gilligan? Did another banana leaf attack you? GILLIGAN I know you don't believe me, but there was a gorilla. SKIPPER Oh, stop that talk. Come on. Skipper leads Gilligan further down the jungle path. Skipper stops at a tree. SKIPPER (cont'd) There isn't a gorilla within five thousand miles of here. Now, let's look for that diamond. PAN UP the palm tree to find the gorilla hanging onto the tree well above their heads. The men continue walking down the jungle path. The gorilla jumps down from the tree and follows the men down the path. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY Skipper, Gilligan, and the gorilla walk single file down the jungle path. Skipper stops walking. SKIPPER They had to take one or the other of these paths. I'll take this one, and you take that one. I'll meet you at the spring. GILLIGAN Oh, no, Skipper. But, Ski -- SKIPPER Now, Gilligan, just keep thinking of that ten thousand dollar reward. Start looking. Skipper takes the right fork and exits. Gilligan stays on the left fork. Gilligan walks cautiously down the path. He senses something behind him. The gorilla stays slightly behind him. GILLIGAN I thought you were gonna take the other path. Gilligan reaches down and feels the fur on the gorilla's arm. The gorilla sniffs Gilligan's hand. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Don't play tricks on me. Gilligan turns, sees the gorilla, and panics. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper! Skipper! Skipper! The gorilla flees into the jungle underbrush. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper! Skipper! Skipper! Skipper! Skipper runs up to Gilligan. SKIPPER What is it, little buddy? Did you find the diamond? GILLIGAN No, but I saw it. SKIPPER You're not gonna tell me about that gorilla again. GILLIGAN I won't tell you about it, but I saw something that frightened me. SKIPPER Well, what was it? GILLIGAN It's about this tall, has long hairy arms, kind of walks like this, weighs two hundred and fifty pounds. Maybe it's a bird. Skipper stammers. SKIPPER A -- a -- a bird? It sounds like a gorilla! GILLIGAN A gorilla! Gilligan jumps into Skippers arms. FLIP TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - NIGHT Mrs. Howell and Mr. Howell stand near the edge of the camp clearing. Between them a coconut torch on a bamboo pole burns brightly. MRS HOWELL They searched every place and can't find it. MR HOWELL Yes, I know that, Lovey, but you see after some of the things I said this morning ... GORILLA watches the Howells from a vantage point in the jungle. MR HOWELL (O.S.) ... whoever found it might find it embarrassing to return it. BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL Now, here's the plan. We're going to turn out both torches, you understand. And whoever has the diamond can leave it on the table, and no questions will be asked. MRS HOWELL Oh, Thurston, you're so clever about these things. I'm sure if you'd been a detective, you'd have caught the fugitive by now. MR HOWELL Yes, I think I would have. Now, Lovey, when I tell you, you turn out the torch, all right? Mr. Howell walks to the dining table where the other castaways sit patiently. A similar coconut torch on a bamboo pole illuminates the dining table. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Oh, I know that you're all very tired. I appreciate your searching, but I have a little plan. Now, here we have a ten thousand dollar reward. (spreads the cash on the table) We're going to turn out both torches. Whoever finds the diamond -- has found it -- can just leave it on the table and take the money, no questions asked. PROFESSOR Mister Howell, if we haven't got it, we haven't got it. MR HOWELL Well, after those foolish things I said this morning I feel someone might be a little embarrassed about returning it. Ready? (turns to Mrs. Howell) Okay, Lovey. Mrs. Howell places a hollowed out gourd over the coconut torch near her. After Mrs. Howell's torch is extinguished, Mr. Howell places a shallow bowl over the other torch. The scene becomes dark and Mrs. Howell disappears from view. MRS HOWELL (O.S.) Stop that. What are you doing? Mrs. Howell screams. MR. HOWELL relights his torch. MR HOWELL Lovey! MRS. HOWELL'S TORCH remains covered with the gourd. Mrs. Howell screams. BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL (cont'd) Where's Lovey? Lovey's gone! PROFESSOR It's a gorilla! EXT. JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT The gorilla carries Mrs. Howell over his shoulder as he lumbers up the jungle path. Mrs. Howell kicks and screams. The gorilla turns and looks at the other castaways. EXT. CAMP - NIGHT MR. HOWELL MR HOWELL He's got her! Mr. Howell motions for the others to follow him. BACK TO SCENE Mr. Howell chases after the gorilla and heads for the jungle path. Professor, Skipper, Gilligan, and then Mary Ann and Ginger follow Mr. Howell toward the jungle path. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT The gorilla runs down the jungle path with Mrs. Howell over his shoulder. Mr. Howell pursues them. Professor, Skipper, Gilligan, Mary Ann and Ginger follow. MR HOWELL Lovey! PROFESSOR Missus Howell! SKIPPER Missus Howell, we're coming! MARY ANN Missus Howell! FADE OUT END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT Mr. Howell carries a torch and searches the jungle for his captured spouse. MR HOWELL Lovey! Professor follows him with his own torch. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Lovey! Mr. Howell exits. PROFESSOR Missus Howell! Professor exits. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT Elsewhere, Skipper and Gilligan search the jungle for Mr.s Howell. Each carries their own torch. SKIPPER Missus Howell! GILLIGAN Missus Howell! SKIPPER Missus Howell! GILLIGAN Missus Howell! They stop walking. SKIPPER Oh, little buddy, I'll never ever doubt what you say again. That gorilla you saw really was a gorilla. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Skipper. I should've let him be a dream. Missus Howell! SKIPPER Missus Howell! In the near-dark, Skipper and Gilligan turn toward each other and bump. Gilligan smiles sheepishly. Skipper points down the jungle path. GILLIGAN/SKIPPER Missus Howell! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. TRAP - DAY PROFESSOR uses a handsaw to cut bamboo poles on a small section of a log. He rests his foot on top of the pole to hold it against the log. FOLLOW Professor as he walks over to a trap that Skipper and Gilligan help him build. Professor places the pole on the trap as a bar. Professor and Gilligan lash the pole to the trap. Skipper works on the other side of the trap. PROFESSOR He's not only strong, but he's smart, too. We'll have to camouflage this well to fool him. GILLIGAN If you put a bunch of bananas in here, I'd go get them. SKIPPER That's right, Gilligan. But as the Professor just pointed out, the ape is smart. Professor looks at Gilligan with a hint of a smile. MR. HOWELL walks down toward the trap. He looks fatigued. His tie is loose. He appears tired. He carries a bamboo walking stick that has worn down to half of its original size. Mr. Howell staggers over the men building the trap. He reaches Professor, who supports him. Skipper and Gilligan turn their attention to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL No trace of Missus Howell and that beast. I've searched every inch of this island. PROFESSOR Well, as soon as we finish this trap, we'll go again, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL Carry me, will you? Skipper and Professor each support an arm of Mr. Howells' as they walk away from the trap. PROFESSOR I'm making a map of the island. Professor pulls a folded paper map from his left back pocket. Gilligan tries to leave the cage, but finds that his finger is bound into the trap when they added the last bamboo pole. GILLIGAN Some trap. It's not even finished and it caught me. SKIPPER, MR. HOWELL, AND PROFESSOR look at the Professor's map. PROFESSOR Now, there's gotta be a logical and scientific way to figure out where that gorilla lives. SKIPPER The only problem is, Professor, the gorilla doesn't know anything about logic or science. Gilligan freed himself and joins the others. GILLIGAN Skipper, you have to think like a gorilla. SKIPPER Think like a gorilla? GILLIGAN Yeah, I understand animals and get along with them. Let's see, now, if I was a gorilla, where would I take Missus Howell? Gilligan imitates a gorilla and grunts. SKIPPER Gilligan, we're busy here. Now, go over there and do your gorilla thinking. GILLIGAN The caves! PROFESSOR Of course, the caves! MR HOWELL It's amazing! SKIPPER My little buddy does think like a gorilla. MR HOWELL He even looks like a gorilla. Mr. Howell turns toward the caves. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Let's go. Come. Follow me. I know the way. Gilligan continues to imitate a gorilla and makes gorilla noises. SKIPPER Gilligan. Stop that, now. Come on. Gilligan and Skipper follow Mr. Howell and Professor toward the caves. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAVE - DAY ZOOM to Mrs. Howell as she attempts to communicate with the gorilla just inside the entrance to the cave where the gorilla has confined Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL Get away from me. Really, don't you think you're carrying this joke a little too far? INT. CAVE - DAY MRS. HOWELL AND GORILLA MRS HOWELL Step aside and let me pass. The GORILLA GRUNTS like a raspberry. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Your parents certainly didn't bring you up very well. Do you know who I am? I'm the wife of Thurston Howell the Third. The gorilla screeches and charges at her. Mrs. Howell backs up to the rear wall of the cave. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Really! You're a brute! You're rude! Go away. The gorilla makes noise, turns toward the cave entrance with a little victory dance, and then turns back to Mrs. Howell. EXT. CAVE - DAY Mr. Howell runs down the jungle path toward the cave. Professor, Gilligan, and Skipper follow him. MR HOWELL Lovey! My Lovey! There she is! There she is! Lovey, my dear! My dear, are you all right? Mr. Howell stops at a large boulder which lies close to the cave entrance. The gorilla stands between Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL Yes, I'm all right, but this baboon has my diamond brooch. The GORILLA aggressively GRUNTS at her. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) I mean, this miniature King Kong has my brooch. He won't let me out of here. Mr. Howell turns toward the other castaways. MR HOWELL That's a Howell for you. Hasn't lost her sense of humor. (to gorilla) Out of my way! The GORILLA GRUNTS and matches Mr. Howell's aggression. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Sir, I am Thurston Howell the Third. MRS HOWELL Well, I told him that, darling, but he doesn't seem at all impressed. MR HOWELL I'm a Harvard man. Mr. Howell lunges at the gorilla, but the gorilla charges back, forcing Mr. Howell to retreat. Mr. Howell runs back to the other men. The GORILLA turns and GRUNTS at Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL Good heavens! A Yale man. GILLIGAN He hasn't harmed Missus Howell. Maybe he likes her. MR HOWELL Well, I assure you she didn't run away with him. GILLIGAN I tell you what. I'll try to lure him out of the cave and Missus Howell can sneak past. Mr. Howell pats Gilligan on the back. MR HOWELL You do that, we'll be eternally grateful. Gilligan approaches the gorilla. SKIPPER We're real proud of you, Gilligan. MR HOWELL Go. PROFESSOR Careful, Gilligan. Gilligan stops in front of the gorilla. GILLIGAN Hi, hi, old pal. Remember me? We held hands in the jungle, huh?. Gilligan jumps in place like an ape. The gorilla mimics Gilligan. Gilligan scratches his sides. The gorilla mimics him scratching his sides. Gilligan scratches his head and again the gorilla mimics him. Gilligan pounds his chest Tarzan-style. The gorilla mimics him. Gilligan turns toward the men, but looks back at the gorilla. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Now follow me. Follow the leader. Come on. The gorilla screeches and charges at Gilligan. Gilligan flees to the safety of the other men. SKIPPER Let's face it. That gorilla's a dumb animal. He only knows brute force. I'll threaten him with this club. I'll show him who's boss. Skipper carries the club to the gorilla. Skipper strikes the gorilla over the head with the club. It easily breaks in two. The gorilla grabs Skipper and lifts him over his head, twirling him around before tossing him over to the men. Skipper tumbles to their feet. GILLIGAN Are you all right, Skipper? Now he knows who's boss, huh? Gilligan and Professor help Skipper back to his feet. MR HOWELL Why doesn't he let us near her? PROFESSOR He's just protecting his mate, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL His mate? Really. PROFESSOR Well, that's just a figure of speech, but that's the way the gorilla really feels. MR HOWELL Well, I'm sure it's a one-sided affair. But, I mean, isn't there anything that we can do? PROFESSOR Well, we haven't got any weapons. We can't rush him because he might hurt Missus Howell. GORILLA at the cave entrance beats his chest. Mrs. Howell stands behind him. BACK TO SCENE PROFESSOR (cont'd) We'll have to try to capture him with a net. Gilligan, why don't you start collecting strong vines? GILLIGAN Sure, Professor, yeah. Gilligan exits. SKIPPER Yeah, that's right, Professor. I've heard that they capture monkeys that way, but we've got to figure out some way to lure him away from the cave. MR HOWELL Well, I'll -- I'll get some food. PROFESSOR Well, when he's being this protective, food isn't going to do it. MR HOWELL Now, wait a minute. He kidnapped Missus Howell. That means the scoundrel has an eye for the ladies. Why don't we use Ginger and Mary Ann as a decoy, and drop a net over him? PROFESSOR I'm not sure that'll work, but it's worth a try. SKIPPER Well, but, Mister Howell, that'll be kind of dangerous. Now, I'd be glad to put on one of the dresses. MR HOWELL No offense, Skipper, but -- uh -- you putting on one of the dresses is like putting a banana skin over a watermelon. FLIP TO: INT. GIRLS HUT - DAY Mary Ann and Ginger place large bamboo poles against their hut's walls to brace them. MARY ANN Poor Missus Howell. Gee, Ginger. Maybe we should've left a place for us to get out. I mean, he is a gorilla. He could come through the ceiling, you know. GINGER If he comes through the ceiling, I'm going out through the wall. A KNOCK. The women exclaim and grab each other. GINGER (cont'd) A gorilla wouldn't knock, would he? MARY ANN I don't think so. They release each other and walk toward the barricaded door. GINGER Who is it? MR HOWELL It's me, Mister Howell. Mr. Howell opens the door and the bamboo poles fall to the ground. MR HOWELL (cont'd) It's a logjam? GINGER Did you find Missus Howell? MR HOWELL Well, yes. The beast has her in a cave and won't let her out. MARY ANN Would -- Is she all right? MR HOWELL Well, she seems to be. I've come to you two girls for help. MARY ANN Help? GINGER How? MR HOWELL I want you to act as decoys so we can drop a net over the gorilla. Mr. Howell chuckles uncomfortably. MARY ANN I'd do anything for Missus Howell, but I'd be scared to death. MR HOWELL Yes, I know, but Mary Ann you were raised on a farm. You know all about animals. MARY ANN Cows, yes. Gorillas, no. MR HOWELL And, Ginger, you're an actress. Just make believe it's a part and make believe the gorilla is a marvelous, wonderful star. GINGER Mister Howell, even if it were Richard Burton under all that hair, I'd have to say no. Mr. Howell pulls out cash from his pocket and offers it to Ginger. GINGER (cont'd) I -- I'm sorry, Mister Howell. You've got the wrong girl. MR HOWELL Ginger, you know, a funny thing. After we're rescued I'm planning on making a CinemaScope color picture about a beautiful girl and a gorilla -- GINGER Oh, come on. What are we waiting for? MR HOWELL -- in a cave. All three head for the door. FLIP TO: INT. CAVE - DAY The gorilla grooms himself. Mrs. Howell sits on a boulder in the cave and holds her brooch. She rubs her lorgnette on her glove and then looks at the gorilla through her it. MRS HOWELL I'm really very flattered by your attention, but we don't have very much in common. The gorilla takes her lorgnette and looks Mrs. Howell up and down. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Oh, really? Mrs. Howell takes the lorgnette back from the gorilla. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Just because our ancestors used to swing in trees is hardly a basis for a continuing friendship. Mrs. Howell stands up. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) This is getting to be a dreadful bore. The gorilla prevents her from leaving. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Now, be a nice little boy and let me pass. The gorilla doesn't budge. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) But you don't seem to understand. Thurston's a very generous man. He'll buy you your own banana farm. Mrs. Howell attempts to leave again. The gorilla prevents her from leaving. She pushes the gorilla aside, but he doesn't move. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Thurston! Thurston! Where are you? EXT. CAVE - DAY Mr. Howell, Mary Ann, Skipper, Ginger, and Professor stand together outside the cave. MR HOWELL Just be patient, Lovey. INT. CAVE - DAY Mrs. Howell tries to brush the gorilla away. He growls at her. MRS HOWELL (growls) Yourself. EXT. CAVE - DAY Mr. Howell, Mary Ann, Skipper, Ginger, and Professor stand together outside the cave. Ginger holds a sheer scarf. PROFESSOR Gilligan is standing by the net to release it. Mister Howell, you stay here with Mary Ann. The Skipper and I'll stand by to protect Ginger, just in case. Now, everybody ready? They vocalize agreement. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Ginger, you know what you're supposed to do. GINGER Yeah, attract a gorilla. I hope my agent doesn't hear about this. Professor and Skipper escort Ginger to Gilligan. Professor holds her hand. Gilligan holds a vine attached to the net. PROFESSOR Gilligan, everything all set? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. PROFESSOR Now remember, when I snap my fingers, you drop the net. GILLIGAN You can count on me. PROFESSOR All right, Ginger. Go. Professor releases Ginger's hand. Ginger begins her seduction of the gorilla. The men hide nearby. The GORILLA notices Ginger and GRUNTS. He takes some tentative steps toward her. Ginger slinks toward him. The GORILLA GRUNTS. She pauses. She uses the scarf to gain the gorilla's attention. MR. HOWELL AND MARY ANN watch Ginger from a safe distance. PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN, AND SKIPPER watch from a different vantage point. SKIPPER She's attracting his attention. GILLIGAN I think that gorilla's got sailor's blood. BACK TO SCENE Ginger waves the scarf in the gorilla's face. She backs away from the cave entrance slowly. The gorilla follows her. PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN, AND SKIPPER stand nearby, ready to pounce. PROFESSOR Ginger, can you be a little sexier? BACK TO SCENE Ginger spins to face Professor. GINGER With a gorilla? PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN, AND SKIPPER instruct Ginger. SKIPPER Go ahead, Ginger, under the net. BACK TO SCENE Ginger crouches low and waves the scarf. The gorilla gently beats his head with his arms. Ginger drops her scarf and backs away from under the net toward the men. GORILLA throws his hands up, as if he's had enough. The GORILLA GRUNTS and returns to the cave entrance where Mrs. Howell stands. MR. HOWELL AND MARY ANN watch from a safe distance. Mr. Howell is slightly disturbed that the gorilla went back to Mrs. Howell. PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN, SKIPPER, AND GINGER stand to the side. GILLIGAN I'll tell you one thing. That gorilla isn't human. PROFESSOR Hold it. It's not working. Professor picks Ginger's off the ground and gives it back to her. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Ginger, you better go back with Mister Howell and Mary Ann. GINGER Okay, Professor. SKIPPER Thanks a lot, Ginger. GINGER You're welcome. PROFESSOR Wait a minute. I've got a better idea. Why didn't I think of it before? Professor snaps his fingers. GILLIGAN pulls on the vine to trigger the net. FOLLOW Gilligan as he walks over to Professor and Skipper who are captured by the net. SKIPPER Gilligan! Professor and Skipper struggle to remove the net. As they finally remove it, they heap it upon Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) If he'd been paying attention, this wouldn't have happened. PROFESSOR What I started to say, Skipper -- SKIPPER Yeah, I know, before Gilligan here tripped the net. GILLIGAN Oh, no. He said when he snapped his fingers, and he snapped his finger, and when he said snap -- Gilligan tries to snap his fingers, but can't. PROFESSOR All right, Gilligan, that's enough for now. (turning to Mr. Howell) Mister Howell? MR HOWELL Yes, yes, yes. PROFESSOR Does Missus Howell have any perfume on? MR HOWELL Of course she does. Why? PROFESSOR Well, first he took her brooch which should have some scent of her perfume and then he took her. Now, Gorillas are known to be attracted to sweet fragrances. Do you see what I'm getting at? MR HOWELL Well, of course I do. PROFESSOR Is there more of that perfume? MR HOWELL On her dressing table in the hut. PROFESSOR (turns to Gilligan) Gilligan -- GILLIGAN I'm way ahead of you. I'll go get it. What's the name? MR HOWELL Warm Afternoon. GILLIGAN "Warm Afternoon"? MR HOWELL Yes. Gilligan runs in pursuit of the perfume. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Gilligan enters the Howell's hut through the beaded curtain and moves over to the dressing table. He finds bottles of perfume and picks the up, holding them close to his chest. CLOSE ANGLE ON GILLIGAN'S CHEST He holds one of the bottles is upside down. Its contents spill out. BACK TO SCENE He reads the label on each bottle and puts it back on the dressing table when it is not the one he seeks. GILLIGAN "Pool of Tears," "Happy Hours," -- uh -- "Foggy Night." No. Gilligan looks at the last bottle. GILLIGAN (cont'd) "Noon refta mraw." (pause) "Noon refta mraw"? Gilligan turns the bottle right-side up. Gilligan sniffs and realizes that he emptied the entire bottle onto himself. GILLIGAN (cont'd) "Warm Afternoon." Gilligan exits through the beaded curtain. FLIP TO: EXT. CAVE - DAY Mr. Howell stands close to the cave entrance. MR HOWELL Don't worry, Lovey. We've got an idea. The gorilla lunges at Mr. Howell aggressively. Mr. Howell backs away and the gorilla throws branches at him. Mr. Howell retreats to the other castaways. MR HOWELL (cont'd) I just told Lovey we're working on a theory how to free her from that hairy delinquent. Gilligan runs into the middle of the group. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, it's empty. Professor rubs his cheeks. Mary Ann and Ginger waves the air to clear it. PROFESSOR You don't have to tell us what happened. NEW ANGLE The gorilla swings from a wine as if he were Tarzan and picks up Gilligan. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan and the gorilla swing to a nearby tree. GILLIGAN cries for help. GILLIGAN Skipper! NEW ANGLE The gorilla swings Gilligan to the next tree. BACK TO SCENE Mrs. Howell flees the cave and joins the group. MRS HOWELL The gorilla left me. MR HOWELL He found someone more attractive. MRS HOWELL Who? MR HOWELL Gilligan. MRS HOWELL Gilligan? MR HOWELL Well, he does have a certain air about him. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Mary Ann picks wildflowers into a bouquet. She walks over to Ginger who carries a similar bouquet. MARY ANN Oh, gee, I hope the Professor's right. These flowers will lure that gorilla away from Gilligan. GINGER Poor Gilligan. The last three hours, that gorilla's been looking at him with love in its eyes. MARY ANN Do you think these will be enough? GINGER You take these. I'll pick some more. Ginger hands her bouquet to Mary Ann. Mary Ann turns and exits. Ginger crouches to pick more flowers. EXT. CAVE - DAY Mr. Howell and Skipper smell the huge pile of flowers the girls collected. Professor and Mrs. Howell stand with them. MR HOWELL Ah! There's enough aroma there to attract any gorilla. PROFESSOR Well, he hasn't paid any attention to it so far. SKIPPER Oh, here comes Mary Ann with some more. MARY ANN walks up with more flowers. The gorilla grabs Mary Ann. Mary Ann screams. The gorilla swings Mary Ann toward the cave entrance. GILLIGAN Let her go! Let her go! The GORILLA grabs the flowers from her and GRUNTS as he presents them to Gilligan. Gilligan accepts the flowers. PUSH IN to Gilligan as he sheepishly looks toward the other castaways. FADE OUT END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper and Professor sit at the dining table with many bottles of perfume. Professor sniffs one perfume bottle. Professor pours some of it into a plastic bowl. PROFESSOR Considering the prices of these perfumes it's nice of Missus Howell to let us experiment. Professor stirs the contents of the bowl. SKIPPER Poor Gilligan. Last time I saw him the gorilla was sniffing him like a bloodhound on a hot scent. Professor sniffs another bottle. PROFESSOR What we have to do is find a perfume with the same base. Professor sniffs a different bottle. Professor pours some of that bottle into the bowl. Gilligan runs from the jungle into camp. GILLIGAN Skipper! Skipper! SKIPPER Little buddy! Gilligan, how did you get away? GILLIGAN He ran off with somebody he liked better. SKIPPER Who? GILLIGAN Look. Gilligan points. The other men look. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY Hand-in-hand, two gorillas turn to look at the castaways. They skip down the jungle path. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY FADE OUT. THE END 
Episode #5, "Wrong Way Feldman" (The castaways discover a long-forgotten aviator living on the island.)   GILLIGAN'S ISLAND   "Wrong Way Feldman"  by  Fred Freeman  And  Lawrence J. Cohen  October 24, 1964  TEASER  FADE IN  STOCK SHOT - OCEAN VIEW THROUGH PALM TREES - OVERLAY CREDITS  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan is seen walking through the jungle as he carries a bamboo pole with bananas and pineapples attached to the ends. Not paying much attention he decides to stop and take a drink from a coconut he's been carrying in his hand. While drinking, he looks over and sees what appears to be an old airplane in the jungle.  He slowly looks away and then does a double take. He looks at the coconut, thinking it's making him see things and then drops it. He runs over to where the airplane is and gives it several raps on the engine cowling to see if it's real. He's absolutely beside himself and can hardly believe what he's seeing.  GILLIGAN Oh it's real! Oh! Oh! Oh it's got an engine, and wheels, and wings, and a propeller, and oh oh I gotta tell somebody! Oh! Oh boy! Oh boy!  He gives the plane raps several more times just to make sure it's real.  GILLIGAN (Frantically) Stay right here! Don't go away! Oh boy! Oh Boy! Oh boy!  Gilligan takes off at full speed through the jungle as we…   FADE OUT      ACT ONE FADE IN  EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY -  Gilligan, skipper, Mary Ann, Ginger and the professor are all pulling the remaining overgrowth and foliage off the plane.  SKIPPER How we doing professor!? How we doing!?  PROFESSOR Well it's…it's remarkable!  SKIPPER & GILLIGAN Yeah yeah yeah!  PROFESSOR Well considering the fact that this plane must have landed here twenty five or thirty years ago, it's remarkable!  SKIPPER Bu…But can we get it off the ground!?  PROFESSOR Well I…I don't know I'm not sure.  GILLIGAN Awe it's too bad I couldn't find a brand new plane that could fly.  MARY ANN With a great big powerful jet engine.  GINGER Yeah, and great big powerful jet pilot!  PROFESSOR You know something? I believe this engine can be repaired if I could fix the fuel line.  GILLIGAN Then we're saved! We can fly it outta here!  PROFESSOR There's only one problem Gilligan. None of us knows how to fly!  GILLIGAN Ah we could learn! Because the skipper was on an aircraft carrier!  SKIPPER Oh a lot of good that'll do us Gilligan I was a cook!  GINGER My room mate was a stewardess!  MARY ANN I knew a crop duster once in Kansas!  GILLIGAN You see with all that experience we can do it!  SKIPPER Gilligan we haven't got enough experience to fly a kite!  PROFESSOR I'm afraid the skippers right, we could never do it. We'd be better off salvaging the parts of the plane.  GINGER Oh well, it was a peachy idea while it lasted. See ya.  MARY ANN Lets go fix dinner. Cheer up Gilligan.  Mary Ann and Ginger leave the site of the plane and head back to the clearing.  GILLIGAN Professor, don't you think it's worth a chance?  PROFESSOR And that's all you'd get Gilligan, one chance.  SKIPPER Professor we got one chance we've got to take it! We've GOT to take it! Now come on I'll clean off the tail gear, Gilligan you get that cockpit cleaned out.  PROFESSOR Alright I'll have a look at this instrument panel.  GILLIGAN Instru what!?  PROFESSOR The instrument panel.  GILLIGAN Oh.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Mr. And Mrs. Howell are seen making their way through the jungle searching for the others.  MRS HOWELL Thruston, have you any idea where we are?  MR HOWELL Not the faintest!  Mr. Howell starts making Howling noises to attract attention.  MR HOWELL Oowwwww!  Oowwww! Oowwww!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan hears Mr. Howell and replys.  GILLIGAN Over here!  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Mr. And Mrs. Howell hear Gilligan and start to make their way to the airplane clearing.  MR HOWELL Oh yes. I tell you this is absolutely…  MRS HOWELL Over there! Over here, over there.  MR HOWELL Over there yes ,well I heard…I heard the sound.  Mr. And Mrs. Howell are having trouble making their way through the jungle foliage.  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston, this is ghastly!  MR HOWELL Next time well take a live in guide! I've never…  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY  As Mr. And Mrs. make their way to the clearing, the others are continuing to clean off the airplane.  PROFESSOR Say, this instrument panel is in pretty good shape!  SKIPPER Good! Then our chances are better huh?  Mr. And Mrs. Howell finally arrive at the plane.  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston! Gilligan was absolutely right! It IS an airplane!  Mr. Howell is not impressed at what he sees.  MR HOWELL Obviously non scheduled, lets go Lovey.  Gilligan has finished cleaning off the side of the airplane and reveals some writing.  GILLIGAN Hey hey look at this! The spirit of the Bronx!  MR HOWELL The spirit of the Bronx.  PROFESSOR The spirit of the Bronx! Say, that was Wrong Way Feldman's plane!  SKIPPER That's right! The one that he used on his round the world trip!  MR HOWELL Looks more, HALF way around the world! Wrong Way Feldman! So that's what happened to him.  MRS HOWELL (dreamily) It seems like yesterday. And it was really way back in the thirties!  GILLIGAN I read all about him! He was a great pilot!  MR HOWELL Not as far as Howell aircraft was concerned, we invested money in his first plane.  MRS HOWELL Yes that was the one that went non stop from ah…Chicago to New Orleans.  SKIPPER That was pretty good for those days!  MR HOWELL He was suppose to go to Minneapolis! Fool flew the wrong way.  GILLIGAN I guess that's how he got his nick name huh?  MR HOWELL No he got that during world war one, he bombed his own airfield. Pow!  PROFESSOR Regardless he still did a lot for aviation.  SKIPPER And at least he was a pilot! For my money I wish he was here right now!  MRS HOWELL (dreamily) Oh, I can still remember him from the news reels. That jet black hair, and that slim waist and that flying suit. And that wonderful white scarf, flying in the wind. Awe poor Wrong Way.  I wonder if there's a chance he could've survived.  MR HOWELL On the contrary. Wrong Way Feldman has gone to the great hanger in the sky. (pause) Knowing Wrong Way, it's hard to tell which way he went!  Suddenly out of no where.  WRONG WAY I'll tell ya where I went!  A scruffy bearded man in tattered flying clothes, parts some nearby bushes and emerges into the clearing where the others are.  WRONG WAY I'm right here!  Mrs. Howell, completely startled lets out a yelp.  MR HOWELL I don't believe it!  SKIPPER Wrong Way! Your alive!?  WRONG WAY Surprised huh?  SKIPPER Well…but…how did you manage all these years!?  PROFESSOR Are you…are you really Wrong Way Feldman!?  WRONG WAY Who else could I be? I been alone on this island all these years. And then I saw this young fella, nosin around my plane.  GILLIGAN Oh I'm Gilligan Mr. Feldman sir!  WRONG WAY (affectionately) You, may call me Wrong Way.  GILLIGAN Thank you…ah thank you ah this is Mrs. Howell…  Wrong Way immediately sets his gaze on Mrs. Howell and approaches her.  GILLIGAN …and the skipper, and the professor…  WRONG WAY Oh madam you are beautiful!  Wrong Way kisses the gloved hand of Mrs. Howell. Mr. Howell who is standing by, hits Wrong Way's hand with a stick.  GILLIGAN …and that's Mr. Howell.  WRONG WAY Certainly it would be.  MR HOWELL (jealously) Come along Lovey!  MRS HOWELL You see, Thurston's just a little bit jealous.  MR HOWELL No I'm not jealous, I just don't want him slobbering over those expensive gloves! Come along!  Mr. Howell takes Mrs. Howell by the arm and leads her away.  GILLIGAN Stranded on the same island with Wrong Way Feldman! Oh we sure are lucky!  WRONG WAY Oh tha…tha…thank you ah Gilligan?  SKIPPER Your an amazing man! How did you manage to survive all these years!?  WRONG WAY Physical fitness, iron will, perseverance and sixty four bottles of scotch.  PROFESSOR Scotch!? Where did you get the scotch!?  WRONG WAY In with my provisions. You know I had every thing, ah food, gasoline, magazines…  SKIPPER Gasoli…gasoline!? You had gasoline!?  WRONG WAY Certainly.  SKIPPER Well Why didn't you fly out of here!?  WRONG WAY With that engine!? After the first three years I give up trying to fix it, ah it's hopeless!  PROFESSOR Well wait a minute, maybe it isn't! With the spare parts I salvaged from the boat I might be able to fix it!  WRONG WAY You can fix a Krieder Rightner KR21!?  PROFESSOR Well I'll certainly give it a try!  WRONG WAY That's the spirit!! You…you fix her up I'll fly her right out!  GILLIGAN Mr. Wrong Way? You're the best thing that ever happened to us!  WRONG WAY Oh just a minute now tha…tha.there's much work to be done!  SKIPPER That's right men we've got much work to do! Wrong Way, the supply huts this way.  Skipper point in the direction of the supply hut and as soon as they start to leave the clearing, Wrong Way turns the wrong way and starts to walk in the opposite direction. After a few steps he realizes his mistake and turns around and follow the Skipper, Gilligan and the professor out of the clearing.  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY - LATER  The Skipper and Professor are busy working on the airplane trying to make if flight worthy.  SKIPPER Professor this bolts the wrong size see if there's some others in the tool box will ya?  PROFESSOR Alright skip.  We pan over to see Wrong Way relaxing. Gilligan is sitting next to Wrong Way having a conversation as Wrong Way sips on something.  PAN OVER: CLOSE SHOT - WRONG WAY/GILLIGAN  WRONG WAY Possibly this Papaya punch is partly past it's prime. (pause) Well it's hard to believe, planes without propellers, six hundred miles an hour!  GILLIGAN And some go even faster.  WRONG WAY Yes, I certainly must have missed a lot. New planes, new inventions, n…no more rumble seats, n…no more Liberty magazine.  GILLIGAN And you missed the second world war!  WRONG WAY The SECOND world war! So that's what that was! I always wondered what that noise was!  GILLIGAN Do you remember the first world war?  WRONG WAY Do ya…do I reme…I was an ACE my boy an ACE! Oh that was a big one, no picnic up there! Dodgin them bullets, divin in and out in my Bristol Scout. Oh and I met some great pilots in them days. You should have seen my wing man Buckey Lorenzo.  GILLIGAN He was good huh?  WRONG WAY Good!? Th…they still talk about one flight he made! He downed three German planes an…and strafed a railroad yard.  GILLIGAN Sure is a great story! He must have been decorated!  WRONG WAY No he was Court Marshaled.  GILLIGAN Why?  WRONG WAY Cause it was three years after the war was over. Poor Buckey, certainly upset the President.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY  SKIPPER It's no good professor, these bolts just aren't usable.  PROFESSOR I've got an idea.  The professor walks over to Wrong Way still relaxing.  PROFESSOR I got some rusty bolts here. You got any penetrating oil Wrong Way?  WRONG WAY Penetrating oil. Oh certainly, with my provisions.  PROFESSOR Good, lets go get it. With luck we should be through here in a couple of hours.  Wrong Way gets up and starts to walk with the professor. Gilligan is following right behind them.  WRONG WAY Oh luck, that's something everybody can use one time or another. I remember once that three Hinies come at me out of the sun…  Wrong Way continues to tell his tale to the professor as they walk off.  SKIPPER Gilligan! Would you mind coming here a moment?  Gilligan was trying to listen to Wrong Way's story. He'd rather listen then work but stops and makes his way over to the airplane.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper? Can I go with Wrong Way?   SKIPPER Don't you want to help me little buddy?  GILLIGAN Oh yes sir.  SKIPPER Thanks a lot Gilligan, now would you mind checking that rear wheel I think it's loose.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  SKIPPER I'll lift the tail.  Gilligan disappears behind the plane as the skipper with great effort, lifts the tail of the plane. We cut to below the plane as Gilligan is seen twisting the tail wheel back and forth.  SKIPPER Well!?  GILLIGAN Yeah it's a little loose.  SKIPPER How Loose!?  Gilligan twists some more and the wheel comes off the plane. Gilligan, with tail wheel in hand pops up behind the skipper to show him.  GILLIGAN This loose!  SKIPPER (VERY STRAINED) Gilligan, get something to put under the tail of the plane so we can put the wheel back on!!!  GILLIGAN I'll get that rock over there!  Gilligan points to a huge boulder behind him and sets out to lift it. He's trying very hard to move the boulder, but it doesn't budge. The skipper sees how futile his efforts are and becomes agitated.  GILLIGAN I can't move it skipper!  SKIPPER (STRAINED) Would you like me to help you Gilligan!?  GILLIGAN Yeah that's a good idea!  The skipper has had enough.  SKIPPER (VERY STRAINED) Oh GILLIGAN!! Hurry up it's slipping!!  The skipper is losing his grip on the plane as it slowly starts to drop.  SKIPPER (STRAINED) It's beginning to sli…  Gilligan is trying to help the skipper keep the plane up, but his efforts are unrewarding.  SKIPPER (STRAINED) Put it down now Gilligan!  The plane is slowly lowered with Gilligans help.  GILLIGAN It's resting on the ground.  SKIPPER (IN PAIN) Gilligan you think it's on the ground? It's on my FOOT!!  Gilligan helps the skipper raise up the tail just enough for the skipper move his foot. The skipper removes his foot and looks relieved, but Gilligan is still trying to hold up the tail. The skipper has let go of the tail and now Gilligan is trying to keep it up.  GILLIGAN Skipper! Skipper!! SKIPPER!!!  The skipper realizes Gilligan is in trouble and quickly helps lower the tail to the ground. Once on the ground, Gilligan and the skipper look totally exhausted but relieved.  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF OCEAN/BEACH WITH PALM TREES.  FADE TO: EXT - WRONG WAY'S HUT CLEARING - NIGHT  FADE TO: INT - WRONG WAY'S HUT - NIGHT  Wrong Way is seen sleeping in a hammock snoring away as Ginger, who has made her way into the hut, quietly approaches the sleeping Wrong Way.  GINGER (WHISPERING) Wrong Way.  Wrong Way continues to sleep.  GINGER (WHISPERING) Wrong Way.  Again no response, so Ginger gives him a little nudge. Wrong Way awakens slightly but doesn't respond.  GINGER (WHISPERING) Wrong Way. Is there room for me?  Wrong Way still half asleep responds.   WRONG WAY (SLEEPILY) No, don't you have a hammock of your own?  GINGER Wrong Way! I meant on the plane! Can you take me with you on the plane?  WRONG WAY No it's a one seater.  GINGER Well, I'll sit on your lap.  WRONG WAY I won't be able to see where I'm goin.  GINGER Well you can sit on my lap.  WRONG WAY Awe my feet won't touch the pedals!  GINGER Oh please Wrong Way, I've just got to get back to Hollywood. If I don't get back to Hollywood soon, my career will be ruined. Please Wrong Way. I can promise you glamorous evenings. Moon lit nights. Just you and me.  Wrong Way hasn't heard a word as he starts snoring again, fast asleep.  GINGER Think it over Wrong Way.  Ginger gives him a little kiss before we…  FLIP TO: SAME LOCATION - LATER  Mr. Howell quietly enters the hut and makes his way towards Wrong Way. As usual, Mr. Howell is carrying his teddy bear.  MR HOWELL (QUIETLY) Wrong Way!  WRONG WAY Forget the moon lit nights you ain't goin with me.  MR HOWELL Moon lit nights!? I'm here to make you a business proposition. Look, you take me with you on the plane and I'll make you vice president of Howell Aircraft corporation. You'll be on the big board and…  Wrong Way doesn't respond.  MR HOWELL I'll make you president with stock options!  Still no response  MR HOWELL Chairman of the board with fringe benefits!  Again, nothing.  MR HOWELL Wrong Way I've got to get off this island, if I don't the Howell empire will crumble, it'll…one final offer Wrong Way. I'll give you half interest of everything I got, my industries my…I'll even give you my…my very own teddy bear.  Mr. Howell gives Wrong Way his most prized possession. Wrong Way takes the teddy bear but says nothing. Mr. Howell is quite upset at Wrong Ways lack of enthusiasm.  MR HOWELL (SOTTO) A man makes a fair offer and a…  Mr. Howell grabs his teddy bear back, turns and leave the hut as we…  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - MORNING  Wrong Way is seen inspecting his airplane and appears pleased with the results. He looks as if he's ready to take to the air. The rest of the castaways are standing by watching.  WRONG WAY Apple pie order! Beautiful!  Wrong Way pats his hand on the engine cowling and finds dirt on his fingers.  WRONG WAY Dirt!  Gilligan uses his shirt to rub the dirt off Wrong Ways fingers. Wrong Way is now ready to fly.  WRONG WAY Standby Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  WRONG WAY Professor you done a great job I'm quite satisfied.  PROFESSOR Well thank you Wrong Way. Everyone's  worked very hard.  WRONG WAY Bless you all!  MARY ANN Wrong Way!?  WRONG WAY What?  MARY ANN Oh good luck!  With that, Mary Ann gives Wrong Way a kiss on the cheek. As Wrong Way start back to the plane, he puts his arm around her waist and starts to lead her to the plane as if he was taking her with him. The skipper sees this and pulls Mary Ann away at the last second. Wrong Way looks a bit put back at loosing her.  WRONG WAY Lindy had sandwiches!  Wrong Way then gets in the plane and prepares for take off. Gilligan is at the front of the plane ready to help.  MR HOWELL Oh Wrong Way! Remember fringe benefits, come back for you know who!  MARY ANN Oh When you get to Kansas would you call my Uncle George and Aunt Martha please!  GINGER Oh a…and when you get to Hollywood, would you call my agent and his wife, who ever he's married to this week!  WRONG WAY Please please! I…I…I want you'z all to understand, WE, ain't any more important than any one of you. Although, I'll be up THERE risking my life, still, it's a team that counts! Alright! Clear the runway!  Wrong Way takes his seat in the airplane and makes ready.  WRONG WAY Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Yes sir!  WRONG WAY Rudder!  GILLIGAN Check!  WRONG WAY Left wing flap!  GILLIGAN Check!  WRONG WAY Right wing flap!  GILLIGAN Check!  WRONG WAY STAND BY!!  GILLIGAN Standing by!  WRONG WAY Contact!  Gilligan gives the propeller a swing and the engine sputters to life. Gilligan is flung into the skipper where he ends up on the ground. Wrong Way is getting ready to rev up the engine when the engine backfires and the propeller falls to the ground.  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT  It's dark and there's a shadow seen of an unknown person walking near the airplane. He grabs a wing strut and starts to cut it using a hack saw as we…  FADE OUT    ACT TWO FADE IN  STOCK SHOT OF OCEAN/BEACH VIEW WITH PALM TREES  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - MORNING  As before Wrong Way in seated in the plane and making preparations for take off.  WRONG WAY GILLIGAN!  GILLIGAN Yes Sir!  WRONG WAY Stand by!  GILLIGAN Standing by!  WRONG WAY Alright everybody clear the runway!  WRONG WAY CONTACT!  GILLIGAN Contact!  Once again Gilligan swings the propeller to get it going. The engine coughs to life and this time the propeller stays on.  ALL Yeh!!  MR HOWELL Ah Bravo!  WRONG WAY I'm taken her straight up!  ALL YEH!!  As Wrong Way looks around for a final inspections, he notices something wrong with the wing support.  INSERT: CLOSE SHOT OF CUT WING SUPPORT  Wrong Way senses the danger, and leaps out of the plane and onto the ground. The professor runs over to aid Wrong Way.  PROFESSOR Wrong Way! Are you alright!  SKIPPER Gilligan cut the motor!!  GILLIGAN Yes sir!  Gilligan runs to the cockpit and reaches inside to cut the engine. The skipper and professor are at Wrong Ways side.  MR HOWELL First sign of trouble and he bails out!  WRONG WAY Look at that! I wouldn't had no control of the plane!  PROFESSOR Your right! Someone's tampered with this strut! And it was no accident!  WRONG WAY What do you mean!  PROFESSOR Somebody sabotaged this plane!  GILLIGAN Yeah and they cut the strut too!  SKIPPER That's nonsense! Who'd want to wreck the plane!?  PROFESSOR Maybe there's someone else on this island that we don't know about.  WRONG WAY Maybe one of you isn't so anxious to have me fly for help.  MARY ANN Oh Wrong Way don't be silly! We all want to be rescued.  GINGER And soon! I'm practically all out of mascara!  MR HOWELL Nobodies more anxious to be rescued than we are!  MRS HOWELL That's right we told our chauffer to keep the motor going!  PROFESSOR Well somebody sabotaged this plane!  GILLIGAN And cut the strut!  WRONG WAY Couple a more minutes I could've been killed!  SKIPPER Well from now on we're not taking any more chances! We men will stand a twenty four hour guard around the plane!  MR HOWELL Here here!  WRONG WAY (TO MR HOWELL) Not you!  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT  Gilligan and the skipper are near the airplane late at night and it's Gilligan's turn to guard the plane.  SKIPPER Gilligan there are no more bullets for the gun. So use this bow and arrow for protection.  GILLIGAN Don't worry skipper I'll guard the plane.  SKIPPER There you see. Now that's for protection.  The skipper shows Gilligan how the bow and arrow works.  GILLIGAN Yeah.  SKIPPER Now don't let anyone near the plane cause we don't know who wrecked it. Not anyone at all.  GILLIGAN OK  SKIPPER OK?  GILLIGAN Yeah  SKIPPER I'll relieve you in a couple of hours little buddy.  The skipper hands the bow and arrow to Gilligan who now is trying it out.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  The skipper walks off into the jungle on his way back to camp. Gilligan is left standing near the plane with the bow and arrow looking alert but afraid. He's silently whistling to himself as he looks around exercising the bow and arrow. Suddenly he hears a noise coming from the jungle.  GILLIGAN Who's there!?  SKIPPER Me!  GILLIGAN Who's me!?  SKIPPER It's me!  GILLIGAN Stay where you are me! How do I know it's you!?  SKIPPER Your right it's not me it's the Count of Monte Cristo!  GILLIGAN I knew it!  SKIPPER Gilligan it's the skipper I forgot my lantern!  GILLIGAN Say something the skipper would say!  SKIPPER Put down that bow and arrow you idiot or I'll break you in half!!  GILLIGAN Yep it's the skipper alright!  The skipper enters the clearing at the same time Gilligan is moving his way and runs into skipper as we…  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OCEAN/BEACH VIEW  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY  The skipper and the professor are near the plane waiting for Wrong Way.  PROFESSOR I wonder where Wrong Way is. He said he wanted to test the engine.  SKIPPER Well you know how he is. With his sense of direction if he started for the plane he might've walk straight into the ocean!  PROFESSOR I'm getting worried. Gilligan went after him twenty minutes ago.  Just then Gilligan runs out from the jungle looking worried.  GILLIGAN Skipper! Skipper. Skipper.  SKIPPER What is it Gilligan!  ILLIGAN Wrong Way's gone!  SKIPPER What are you talking about!?  PROFESSOR Wrong Ways gone!?  GILLIGAN His hut's a mess, everything's broken up and thrown around! I thought maybe he's a restless sleeper but…  SKIPPER Are you sure!?  GILLIGAN He must have put up an awful fight!  PROFESSOR Yeah but against what!?  SKIPPER Yeah against what!  GILLIGAN I don't know, but look here's his scarf!  SKIPPER We'll have to spread out and comb the island! Professor you take that direction! Gilligan you go in the back of the island, and I'll go out to the ocean! Alright!?  Gilligan, the skipper and professor all run into each ther as they try to leaving the clearing.  SKIPPER Doh!  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan is searching for Wrong Way as he makes his way through the Jungle. There's a row of bushes he's passing and on the other side is Wrong Way. Wrong way sees Gilligan and they start a game of walking around and through the bushes. Wrong Way is trying not to be seen. Eventually Gilligan parts the bushes, only to be staring into the face of Wrong Way and is startled.  GILLIGAN Waaahhhh! Wrong Way!!   Wrong Way turns and runs away as Gilligan follows.  GILLIGAN Wrong Way!? Wrong Way!?  Wrong Way is trying to evade Gilligan and makes his way to the jungle clearing where he's been staying. Gilligan follows him into the clearing.  GILLIGAN Boy I'm sure glad I found you!  Gilligan looks around and doesn't see anyone else there but Wrong Way.  GILLIGAN Where are the kidnapers huh?  WRONG WAY There ain't no kidnappers.  GILLIGAN No kidnappers?  WRONG WAY It was a hoax!  GILLIGAN You were kidnapped by a hoax!?  WRONG WAY Can't you understand Gilligan! I am a coward!  GILLIGAN What!!?  WRONG WAY Sure.  I'm the one who sabotaged that plane. I loosened the propeller, I cut the struts. After all these years I just couldn't fly that plane! Oh I'm washed up, through! Gilligan, I am grounding myself.  Wrong Way removes the flying wings from his flight suit and gives it to Gilligan.  GILLIGAN The way you were talking, we all thought you wanted to fly!  WRONG WAY Aaaah…it was just a front for a man who has lost his confidence. Ah It would have been better if I'd remained lost to the world. Since I ain't got nothing left to give it.  GILLIGAN What about me!? You could teach me to fly! And I can take that plane out of here!  WRONG WAY You fly the Spirit of the Bronx!?  GILLIGAN Sure!  WRONG WAY Handle a Krieder Rightner KR21!?  GILLIGAN With you teaching me, I can handle a Krieder…Kried…  WRONG WAY Krieder Rightner  GILLIGAN I can handle it!  WRONG WAY Yeah but Gilligan! I always fly the wrong way!  Gilligan That's ok! You point me in one direction and I'll go in the other!  WRONG WAY It just might work! At least it'd be a chance to save them people.  GILLIGAN We'll get started right away! I'll go tell the others!  WRONG WAY You'll do nothing of the kind! We'll stay right here. Then when the conditions are prevailed, as far as they're concerned, you're going to rescue them Gilligan. And Wrong Way Feldman, will remain lost to the world. A legend in his own time.  GILLIGAN Wrong Way, your quite a guy and, whether you think so or not, you deserve these wings!  Gilligan takes the wings Wrong Way gave him and slaps them back onto Wrong Ways chest. The pins on the back of the wings are driven neatly into Wrong Way's chest with great pain to Wrong Way.  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF OCEAN/PALM TREES EVENING  FADE TO : EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT  The skipper is seen "guarding" the plane but is obviously sleeping cause he's snoring. Suddenly he hears a sound coming from the jungle and is now very alert.  SKIPPER Who goes there!?  The professor comes from around the plane without saying a word and scares the life out of the skipper.  PROFESSOR It's my turn to…  The skipper lets out a howl of fear as soon as the professor speaks. Realizing it's only the professor, the skipper is very much relieved.  SKIPPER Professor Ha…ha…ha…ha, wells alls well so far. Ah Gilligan will be here at six to relieve you.  PROFESSOR Well he's suppose to but then again you never know what Gilligan will do.  SKIPPER Yeah I know.  The skipper turns and leaves to go back to his hut.  PROFESSOR Good night skip.  SKIPPER Good night.  FLIP TO: EXT - WRONG WAY'S HUT CLEARING - NIGHT  We see Wrong Way and Gilligan in the clearing where Gilligan found Wrong Way. Gilligan is sitting on a fallen tree trunk with various fruits attached to a board in front of him. Wrong Way is at his side as he gives "flight" instructions.  WRONG WAY Alright, one two three four we go through it again! The banana is the oil pressure. The coconut is the altitude. The pineapple is the speed gauge. The Papaya is the ignition. Now you gotta keep your eyes on the instruments at all times. Alright now get ready for take off. First thing you do is you flip on the ignition.  Gilligan reaches for the coconut.  WRONG WAY No no! That's the altitude!  GILLIGAN I went to turn on the Papaya instead of the coconut.  WRONG WAY Alright, now what's the second thing you do?  Gilligan's leg is bouncing up and down rapidly and Wrong Way is getting testy.  WRONG WAY No no no what are you doing!!?  GILLIGAN My foot asleep!  Gilligan is making engine noises with is mouth as he continues to receive flight instructions.  FLIP TO: SAME SCENE - LATER  WRONG WAY Alright, one two three four we try it again. You are flying at an altitude of thirty thousand feet, suddenly you encounter head winds of eighty miles an hour! Show me what you do!  Gilligan pulls back on the makeshift control stick.  WRONG WAY No no your looping!!  Gilligan then pushes forward on the stick.  WRONG WAY Now your in a power dive!  Gilligan start moving the stick around frantically and ends up pulling it out. He tosses the sick aside.  WRONG WAY Now your in a tail spin!! Look out your gonna crash!! Your gonna crash!  GILLIGAN CRASH!!!  WRONG WAY Yeah!!  GILLIGAN I'm getting out of here!!  Gilligan panics and jumps off the simulated airplane and onto the ground.  WRONG WAY What'd you do that for?  GILLIGAN I don't think that planes too safe!  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OCEAN/BEACH/PALM TREES  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - MORNING  The professor is standing next to the plane waiting for Gilligan to relieve him. Gilligan runs on camera.  GILLIGAN Good morning professor, I'll stand guard now.  PROFESSOR Oh thanks Gilligan, I'll go wake up the skipper. Now that it's getting light we can start looking for Wrong Way again.  GILLIGAN Yeah right!  The professor takes off back to camp as Gilligan watches him leave. When the professor is out of sight, Gilligan signals Wrong Way.  GILLIGAN (WHISPERING) Pssst. Pssst! Hey wrong Way!  WRONG WAY Gilligan are you sure you wanna go through with this?  Gilligan is putting on Wrong Way's filthy old flying coat, helmet and goggles.  GILLIGAN Of course!  WRONG WAY Alright have you got everything straight? On the take off what do you do with the flaps?  GILLIGAN Put'em down!  WRONG WAY No it's the throttle you put down!

WRONG WAY Ok now first, check the instruments.  Gilligan peers down at the instrument panel.  GILLIGAN Uh oh! Uh OH!  WRONG WAY Wha…What's the matter?  GILLIGAN I can't fly this plane! There's no fruit in hear! I know what I'll do, I got a great idea.  Gilligan gets out of the cockpit.  GILLIGAN I'll go get a Pineapple, Papaya and a coconut and…  WRONG WAY GILLIGAN!!!  GILLIGAN I got the banana.  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The sound of an airplane is heard as we see the professor, the skipper, Mr. And Mrs. Howell, Ginger and Mary Ann making their way through the jungle.  PROFESSOR You heard it skipper it had to be our plane that took off!  SKIPPER Wrong Way wouldn't leave without telling us!  MR HOWELL It's getting so a man can't get any sleep around here!

Ginger is spooning onto a plate something out of a pot that's over an open fire. She walks over to the table and starts to dish out what she put on the plate. She sits next to the skipper. As the others pass around the food, they are all talking amongst themselves in an ad- lib fashion. The radio is playing in the background even though we can't hear it over the chatter.  (TRANSCRIBERS NOTE: Since they are all talking over each other, their conversations are unintelligible at best and are not reproduced here)  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  Mr. Howell is by far the most vocal and the skipper is having trouble hearing a news report.

CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT – GROUP  SKIPPER In fact, I'll propose a toast. To Ginger, the most beautiful castaway in the whole wide world.  He raises his coconut for the toast.  GINGER Thank you skipper.  Gilligan stands up.  GILLIGAN Here's to Ginger!  Gilligan raises his coconut and takes a drink.  MRS HOWELL You know there's really more to beauty than perfection of face and figure.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL It also means breeding and poise, and a kind of charm that comes from maturity.  Mr. Howell stands and raises his coconut.  PAN UP WITH MR HOWELL  MR HOWELL Ha…how true. In my opinion, Mrs. Howell is the most beautiful creature, in the world.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP  Gilligan stands once again.  GILLIGAN Here's to Mrs. Howell!  Gilligan raises his coconut smashes it into the skippers coconut, making it splash all over.  PROFESSOR Gentlemen, I'm afraid that I must inject another opinion here.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR  The professor stands and raises his coconut.  PROFESSOR In addition to beauty of face and figure, there is a lady here who also has sweetness and warmth. The lady I would pick as the most beautiful in the world, Mary Ann.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN  Mary Ann looks a bit embarrassed.  MARY ANN (WHISPER) Oh thank you.  Gilligan stands again.  GILLIGAN Here's to Mary Ann!  Gilligan raises his coconut for another toast.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT – GROUP  SKIPPER Well it'd seem that there's a difference of opinion here. But I don't see any reason for argument.

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN  MARY ANN Well what's the fishing pole for?  PROFESSOR Oh that's to provide you with a form of isometric exercise.  CUT TO: ANGLE ON MARY ANN  MARY ANN Isometric exercise?  PROFESSOR Yes.  CUT TO: ANGLE ON PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Always remember that true beauty is the end result of the inner glow of good health. And isometric exercise provides for the inner play of muscle against muscle.  CUT TO: ANGLE ON MARY ANN  PROFESSOR To improve the general physique.  MARY ANN Oh but professor! I just want to beat Mrs. Howell and Ginger, not Cassius Clay!  (Transcribers note: Cassius Clay, AKA Mohammad Ali, was a famous boxer)  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN  PROFESSOR I'll just attach this to your bathing suit. You get in that lagoon and you swim just as hard as you possibly can.  Mary Ann turns around and the professor attaches a hook to the back of Mary Ann's bathing suit.  MARY ANN You're sure it'll help me win?  PROFESSOR Yes this will provide for the inner play of muscle against muscle.  MARY ANN All right, but I don't want to come out looking like Johnny Weissmuller.  (Transcribers note: Johnny Weissmuller played the original Tarzan in the TV series by the same name.)  PROFESSOR Don't worry, you won't. Now get in there and you swim just as hard as you possibly can.  Mary Ann walks off camera towards the Lagoon.  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON – DAY  WIDE SHOT  Mary Ann enters the water and walks out a ways.  MARY ANN Hold on!  She begins to swim very strongly. The professor is holding the fishing pole with all his might.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR  He's seen holding the fishing rod as though he's fighting a big fish.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  She's swimming with all her might, kicking and splashing as she goes.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR  Gilligan walks out of the jungle with his pail from behind the professor and sees the professor struggling. He assumes the professor caught a fish.

Are you or are you not rich enough to be the most beautiful woman wherever you go, hum?  MRS HOWELL Ah, Thurston I'm afraid it's hopeless. Unless of course we can convince Gilligan to vote for me.  MR HOWELL Wait a minute. Do you think I'm the type of man who'd try and influence a judge in a fair and square contest?  MRS HOWELL Yes Thurston.  MR HOWELL You know me pretty good don't you, yes! After all a Howell gets what he needs, and right, now all I need it, Gilligan.

PULL BACK FOR CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GINGER - ANGLE FAVORING SKIPPER  GINGER You know skipper I was just thinking. You shouldn't have yelled at Gilligan this morning.  SKIPPER Why not?  CUT TO: ANGLE ON GINGER  GINGER Well, because um, Mr. Howell is gonna vote for his wife, and the professor is gonna vote for Mary Ann, and that leaves Gilligan to elect miss castaway.  CUT TO: ANGLE ON SKIPPER  SKIPPER Why I know, but he has to vote for you. Wa…I mean you're the obvious winner.  CUT TO: ANGLE ON GINGER  GINGER Well thank you very much, but sometimes the obvious one doesn't win.  CUT TO: ANGLE ON SKIPPER  SKIPPER You got a point there. Gilligan is kind of tender hearted.

MARY ANN Well of course I do but, well do you think I can get Gilligan's vote?  PROFESSOR Oh, that reminds me. I was a bit harsh this morning on our uncommitted delegate.  MARY ANN Well I'm sure Gilligan'll be fair.  PROFESSOR Well just the same, we've got to remedy that. We NEED Gilligan.

Gladys picks off Gilligan's hat as he passes underneath.  GILLIGAN Gladys. Gladys, give me back my hat.  Gladys doesn't respond and picks at Gilligan's hair.  GILLIGAN Gladys my hat. Please.  Still no response and Gilligan is steamed.  GILLIGAN GLADYS GIVE ME MY HAT!!!  WIth that, Gladys puts Gilligan's hat back on is head. Gladys then start whooping and making gestures at Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Huh?  Gladys makes more noise as it trying to communicate.  GILLIGAN Look, don't tell me your troubles, I've got enough of my own.  Gladys keeps up the noise.  GILLIGAN What am I gonna do Gladys?  Gladys responds with more ape sounds and gestures.  GILLIGAN Tell'em to stop walking over me?  Gladys responds in the affirmative with more whoops and hollers.

He is immediately approached by the skipper.  MOVE FORWARD/ROTATE LEFT WITH GILLIGAN TO TABLE  He makes Gilligan sit down at the table.  SKIPPER Gilligan little buddy you're just in time. We saved the biggest Lobster for you.  GILLIGAN Oh no you don't. I'm not taking any more of that!  Ginger puts a large plate with a lobster on it in front of Gilligan.  GINGER Oh Gilligan it's very delicious. I cooked it especially for you.  The skipper puts a napkin under Gilligan's chin.  GILLIGAN Thanks Ginger, I guess it pays to fight back.  SKIPPER Nothings too good for my little buddy!  GILLIGAN Oooo yeah! Everybody loves a fighter!  Just then, the professor and Mary Ann walk on camera carrying another platter of food.  PROFESSOR Gilligan you don't want that!  He slides the skipper's plate away.  GILLIGAN Huh? Yes I do!  PROFESSOR No you don't!  Skipper slides the plate back in front of Gilligan.

Mary Ann gives her plate to the professor who takes the skippers plate and replaces it with his.  PROFESSOR Vitamin A Gilligan, vitamin A! Exactly what a nice boy like you, needs to grow big and strong!  GILLIGAN Ooooo I can hardly wait!

Mr. Howell gives Gilligan a sip of something in a coconut. Gilligan takes a sip and looses his breath.  MR HOWELL From my own private stock it beats that rabbit food any day of the week. Huh? Some more?  Just then, Gilligan gets magically pulled towards the other end of the table.  PAN RIGHT WITH GILLIGAN TO SKIPPER, PROFESSOR, MARY ANN AND GINGER  SKIPPER Come back here Gilligan!

PROFESSOR All right then, my dear, we will make our meals elsewhere.  The professor and Mary Ann walk off camera. Now that Gilligan realizes he's loosing his food, he tries to back peddle.  GILLIGAN I was, just kind of, joking. Don't get mad at me.  GINGER Come on skipper, I don't want to…  The skipper takes his food away also, and he and Ginger walk off camera.

GILLIGAN You see on one hand the skipper's right, and Ginger should win. And on the other hand, the professor's right and Mary Ann should win. Oh what a spot. Only an idiot would get himself in a spot like this.  Gladys starts making loud whoops and arm movements as if to say you're right, you are and idiot.  Mr. Howell can be seen approaching them from behind.  GILLIGAN What!? I don't know, there must be an answer to the problem somewhere.  Mr. Howell come up from behind and makes Gladys get off the log. Mr. Howell sits down right where Gladys was sitting, next to Gilligan. Gilligan doesn't see the switch.  GILLIGAN Well, I don't know. I wish somebody'd tell me what to do.  MR HOWELL I'd be very happy to tell you my boy.  GILLIGAN Thanks.  Gilligan's eyes open wide as he thinks Gladys is talking to him and turns to look at her. He sees Mr. Howell and lets out a scream and leaps off the log. He scares Mr. Howell with his scream, who in turn screams himself.  PAN UP WITH GILLIGAN FOR CLOSE UP  GILLIGAN Ahhhh!  MR HOWELL (O.S.) Ahh!  GILLIGAN (RELEAVED) Oh, it's you Mr. Howell.  Mr. Howell walks in frame for close up.  MR HOWELL Gilligan, I'm a man of few words. What will it cost to get your vote? A yacht? A villa on the Riviera? Controlling interest in the Golden Gate Bridge? Hum?  GILLIGAN Mr. Howell you're trying to bribe a judge!  MR HOWELL Eh…no no no! I was just a, testing your honesty and may I say you came through with flying colors!  GILLIGAN And you're not trying to influence me?  MR HOWELL Oh no no! Cherish the thought.

GILLIGAN Oh, what's her problem?  MR HOWELL Any woman's most cherished possession, her pride.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND MR HOWELL  MR HOWELL I mean look at it this way. Mrs. Howell, a woman of renowned, competing in an ordinary contest like that. It isn't fair. It isn't equitable. It isn't a, Democratic if you'll pardon the expression. Now suppose your own mother was running against Tuesday Weld?  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE FAVORING GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Tuesday Weld!?  (Transcribers note: Tuesday Weld was an actress from the late fifties and early sixties. She even played in "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis" with Bob Denver)  MR HOWELL Who would you vote for?  Gilligan leaps up off the log.  PAN UP WITH GILLIGAN FOR CLOSE UP  GILLIGAN I choose mom! I choose mom!  Mr. Howell walks in frame for close up.  MR HOWELL You're absolutely right! And a vote for Mrs. Howell, is a vote for those ladies that deserve our recognition, the American WIFE, and American mother, and private enterprise. Gilligan, are you an American?  Gilligan gets patriotic and gives a two-finger salute.  GILLIGAN Yes sir! And I vote for Mrs. Howell.  MR HOWELL Three if you don't mind.  Gilligan corrects his salute.  GILLIGAN Three.  Mr. Howell, also satisfied that Gilligan will vote his way, starts a drum and fife rendition of Yankee Doodle using his riding crop as a fife. We follow him as he walks off camera leaving Gilligan alone.  GILLIGAN On one had there's Ginger. On the other hand there's Mary Ann. Looks like I'm gonna need another hand for Mrs. Howell.

Episode #6, “President Gilligan” The Skipper and Mr. Howell compete for leadership on the island through an election for “President.” When the castaways count their votes, the result is unexpected.  “President Gilligan”  By  Roland Wolpert  October 31, 1964  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. OCEAN BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WELL SITE - DAY SHOVELS AND FEET Professor and Skipper dig a shallow hole that is intended to be a well. The Skipper uses a bamboo shovel and the Professor uses a bamboo post hole digger-style shovel. PAN UP to reveal Professor and Skipper dig the well. PROFESSOR Skipper, why don't we get Gilligan to help us with this well? SKIPPER Gilligan help? Professor, you've been out in the sun too long. PROFESSOR Well, all he'd have to do is dig. He can't do anything wrong if he's just digging. SKIPPER Yeah? Skipper laughs. SKIPPER (cont'd) All right. Let's find out. Skipper stops digging. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan! EXT. FUTURE HOWELLS HILLS ESTATE SITE - DAY Mr. Howell explains to Gilligan the layout of the Howell Hills Estate that Mr. Howell will pay Gilligan to build. Mrs. Howell observes approvingly. MR HOWELL Now, nothing pretentious, Gilligan, you understand me now? A simple, flowing, fifteen-room mansion. Right, Lovey? I mean, we'll have four baths, you understand? And we'll have the -- the servant quarters will be over there. Mr. Howell points to the back of the clearing. SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan! GILLIGAN Oh, that's the Skipper. I gotta run. Gilligan turns to leave, but Mr. Howell stops him. MR HOWELL No, you'll do nothing of the sort. You see, we're planning the Howell Hills estate. MRS HOWELL And you don't want to get him in trouble with the Skipper, dear. MR HOWELL Lovey, we are no longer on shipboard. (to Gilligan) Uh, you see, now, this is exactly the way I want the little estate built, you see -- SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan! GILLIGAN I gotta go. Later. Gilligan turns to leave again, but Mr. Howell stops him again. MR HOWELL Stand your ground, Gilligan. GILLIGAN If I do, I'll be buried in it. MRS HOWELL Let the boy go, dear. MR HOWELL He is no longer a boy, Lovey. He is a man. SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan! GILLIGAN I'm a boy. Gilligan turns to leave again, but Skipper, shovel in hand, walks up to them. MR HOWELL Skipper, you're interrupting a business conference. And besides, you're standing in the powder room. SKIPPER Powder room? Business conference? Gilligan, will you get over there and start digging? GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. Gilligan takes a few steps. MR HOWELL Come back here, Gilligan. Gilligan steps back. SKIPPER Get going, Gilligan. Gilligan takes a few steps again. MR HOWELL Come back here, Gilligan! Gilligan steps back. SKIPPER Get going, Gilligan! Gilligan takes a few steps. MR HOWELL Come back here! Gilligan steps back. SKIPPER (to Mr. Howell) I gave him an order! MR HOWELL (to Skipper) And I gave him a job! GILLIGAN I wish I were twins. MRS HOWELL Maybe we should toss a coin. MR HOWELL (irritated) Coin? MRS HOWELL I mean a bill. MR HOWELL A bill. Mr. Howell points to a dollar bill stuck on the end of a short bamboo pole which marks a spot in the Howell Hills Estate plan. DOLLAR BILL is affixed to the top of a bamboo stake. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER I'm having enough trouble running this island without a mutiny! MR HOWELL Well, who told you that you are running this island? SKIPPER I am the Skipper! MR HOWELL At sea, you're the Skipper! On land, I am Chairman of the Board! The other castaways walk onto the future site of the Howell Hills Estate. SKIPPER Professor, will you tell these people who's in charge of this island? PROFESSOR Well, actually, no one is. SKIPPER No one? MR HOWELL No one? Good heavens, this is anarchy! SKIPPER It is not! I am in command! MR HOWELL No, I am running this island! Mary Ann, disliking the yelling, covers her ears. Mrs. Howell plugs her ears with her gloved fingers. The Professor tries to calm them down. PROFESSOR Gentlemen, gentlemen. Ginger moves forward. GINGER I've got an idea. I've got an idea. Why don't we vote? You know, like an election. SKIPPER An election? The castaways begin talking among themselves. Mr. Howell is the most audible. MR HOWELL An election! That's wonderful! Yes! I'll spend millions on my campaign. SKIPPER That's unfair. MR HOWELL You're right. It is unfair. Instead, I'll buy the votes. Let me see. Mr. Howell begins counting the castaways to determine how much it will cost him. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. ISLAND BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY The Professor addresses the castaways regarding the election rules. PROFESSOR And I know that it is going to be a good, clean, hard-fought battle right down to the wire. Mr. Howell and Skipper close in on the Professor. SKIPPER That's right, Professor. There's no room for dirty politics on this island. MR HOWELL I think we can always make a little room for something like that, eh, Professor? Mr. Howell needles Professor in the belly. PROFESSOR Just one thing at that. Let's get this election over with as soon as possible so we can all get back to work on the well. SKIPPER That's fine with me, Professor. I'm ready for that election any time now. MR HOWELL Wait a minute, Captain. When are you coming out of your smoke-filled hut and really face the issues, huh? PROFESSOR What issues, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL Well, I'm sure you'd like to know what my learned opponent thinks, for example, of slum clearance, of tideland oil drilling, of free school lunches! PROFESSOR But, Mister Howell -- MR HOWELL I would like to meet him in face-to-face debate on public transportation, coconut conservation, and high-rise dwellings. Skipper moves aggressively toward Mr. Howell. SKIPPER Now, see here Howell -- The Professor holds the Skipper back. MR HOWELL Now, wait a minute. You're going to have to face up to the issues, Captain, and you better give them some thought. SKIPPER In the first place, who's gonna ask a lot of stupid questions like that? MR HOWELL Missus Howell. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Blankets are hung as curtains to make the hut appear as an election center. Mr. Howell practices his election speech. MR HOWELL And I beg of you, dear friends, do not place one more burden on the fragile shoulders of our dear gallant Captain, who lies sleepless in his bed at night -- sleepless in his bed at night -- MRS HOWELL Ridden with guilt. MR HOWELL Thank you. Yes, yes. Ridden with guilt. Ridden with guilt about the shipwreck, which was his fault. Ridden with guilt about the loss of the transmitter, which was his fault. Filled with shame about his lack of qualities of leadership, which was his mother's fault. What this island needs is a President like me. One who is brave, true, loyal, devoted, and faithful. And, above all, modest. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Skipper practices his campaign speech with Gilligan. SKIPPER And I say to you, don't change leaders in mid-ocean. Elect me first President. The man who's first at sea, on land, and first father of your island. Gilligan claps. GILLIGAN That was great, Skipper. SKIPPER You really think so, Gilligan? GILLIGAN Yeah. Only, can we vote for George Washington? SKIPPER George Washington? GILLIGAN Isn't that who you were talking about? SKIPPER No, Gilligan, I was talking about me. (pause) Why should people vote for me? Gilligan shrugs. GILLIGAN I don't know. SKIPPER Well, think! GILLIGAN I got it. Because you're the Skipper, and you'll threaten them. Skipper thinks about it momentarily. SKIPPER Oh, no, that won't work. GILLIGAN Works with me. SKIPPER But you're different. GILLIGAN I am? SKIPPER Well, certainly. You're my crew. I can threaten you. I've got to woo the voters. GILLIGAN You don't woo me. I'd rather be threatened. SKIPPER Not you, Gilligan! The girls. Skipper smiles and adjusts his shirt collar. FLIP TO: EXT. GIRLS HUT - DAY Skipper, holding a bouquet of flowers, calls on Ginger. As he approaches the door to the hut, he raps his fingers along the door. He passes the hut door, but calls through the palm frond walls. SKIPPER Ginger, are you home? Ginger exits the hut and greets Skipper. GINGER (sultry) Hello, Skipper. SKIPPER Lovely flowers for a lovely lady. Ginger notices the flowers. GINGER Oh, gee, they're lovely. But, she recognizes the flowers. GINGER (cont'd) Ooh! (pause) Those are the flowers the Professor said are poisonous. SKIPPER Poisonous? Ginger nods. SKIPPER (cont'd) Poisonous? Skipper tosses the flowers in the air and runs off. Ginger screams, backs up, and turns to watch the Skipper run into the jungle. FLIP TO: EXT. GIRLS HUT - DAY Mary Ann stands outside the girls hut. Mr. Howell attempts to persuade her to vote for him. MARY ANN Shame on you. MR HOWELL What did I do? MARY ANN Trying to buy my vote. MR HOWELL Well, I did nothing of the kind, Mary Ann. It's perfectly proper for a presidential candidate to want to hire a secretary. Mr. Howell removes his glasses. MARY ANN At fifty thousand dollars a year? MR HOWELL Well, good secretaries are hard to find. MARY ANN I'm not even a good secretary, Mister Howell. As a matter of fact, I'm not even a secretary. I'm only a clerk. MR HOWELL A clerk? Oh, a clerk? In that case, a hundred thousand. Mary Ann scowls at Mr. Howell and turns away. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Group insurance? Fringe benefits? FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Mr. Howell stands outside the shower stall. Ginger showers inside. Overhead is a water bucket with a rope attached. The rope must be pulled to dump water on the occupant of the shower stall. Ginger pulls on the rope and water dumps on her head. MR HOWELL I am not going to insult your intelligence by attempting to bribe you. Ginger sticks her head out between the curtains on the shower. She wears a shower cap. GINGER Gee, Mister Howell, I don't see what one thing has to do with the other. Ginger pulls her head back inside the shower. MR HOWELL Are you suggesting that perhaps you could be bribed? Ginger sticks her head back out. GINGER Everybody says I've got an open mind. Ginger pulls her head back inside the SHOWER. MR HOWELL Ginger, off this island, I'm a very wealthy and important man. As a matter of fact, I'm thinking of buying Hollywood. Ginger sticker her head back out. GINGER Hollywood? MR HOWELL Yes. Don't you think you ought to have a star on your dressing room door? GINGER Oh gee, Mister Howell, I mean, Mister President. Ginger pulls her head back inside the shower. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Gilligan stands by a tree trunk. GINGER Gilligan? Gilligan turns to look and does a double-take as he sees Ginger. GINGER (cont'd) (sultry) Hello. Gilligan walks toward Ginger and looks around to see if anybody else is there. GILLIGAN Who're you talking to? GINGER (sultry) You. GILLIGAN Me? Gilligan backs up. GINGER (sultry) You're the only one here, aren't you? Ginger pushes closer to Gilligan. Gilligan tries to maintain his personal space and slowly steps back as Ginger advances. GILLIGAN Yeah, but I'm just me. GINGER (sultry) I know. Ginger glances at Gilligan's lips. Gilligan becomes a little nervous. GILLIGAN But you've never been so friendly to me before. GINGER (sultry) There's always a first time for everything, (glances at his lips) isn't there? GILLIGAN I must be dreaming. GINGER (sultry) Pinch yourself and see. GILLIGAN Yeah. (pinches) Ow. No, I'm here. And I just remembered. I'm campaigning. Vote for the Skipper. Gilligan nods. GINGER (sultry) Gilligan? GILLIGAN (bashfully) Yeah? Ginger continues to push forward. Gilligan continues his retreat. GINGER (sultry) Come here. Come closer, Gilligan. Gilligan is pushed up against the palm tree. Ginger continues to move in closer. GINGER (cont'd) (sultry) Gilligan, would you do me an extra special favor? Gilligan glances at Ginger's lips. GINGER (cont'd) (sultry) Vote for Howell. Ginger brings her finger to her lips, kisses it, and then moves to press her finger to Gilligan's lips. Gilligan quickly turns his head away and hits the tree he's backed up against with a loud WHACK. Gilligan slides down the tree to the ground. Ginger gives an aside glance and shrugs. WIPE TO: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Skipper holds a paint brush, a small container of paint, and carries a stemmed flower in his teeth. He examines his work from a distance. The campaign sign reads "Don't Change Skippers." He places the flower on the sign. WIPE TO: EXT. LAGOON - DAY Skipper and Gilligan balance on a platform floating in the lagoon. They hold the "Don't Change Skippers" sign. Skipper admires his work and reads the sign. SKIPPER "Don't change Skippers." (pause) Gilligan, get me the paint can. Gilligan turns, holds his pant legs up, and tip-toes across the water to fetch the paint can on the lagoon shore. GILLIGAN Yes, sir. Gilligan picks up the paint can. He tip toes back to the floating platform. SKIPPER Gilligan, you can't just walk on the water. GILLIGAN No, Skipper, I'm walking on this board. (points) See? SKIPPER Oh. Skipper points at a gap between the board and the platform. SKIPPER (cont'd) Well, the board ends there. Don't step out there. GILLIGAN No, sir. Gilligan steps onto the platform, but trips. He falls into Skipper and both of them tumble into the lagoon. Skipper lifts the sign to ensure that it does not fall near them. Skipper and Gilligan swim in the lagoon. The paint can fell on Gilligan, which he wears like a hat. WIPE TO: EXT. FUTURE HOWELLS HILLS ESTATE SITE - DAY Gilligan and Mr. Howell walk in the clearing where the mansion will be built. MR HOWELL Gilligan, my boy, have you ever thought about yourself? GILLIGAN Have I ever thought what about myself? MR HOWELL What I mean is, what you want to be in life. GILLIGAN Oh, sure. Sometimes I lie awake at night and I think -- if I try hard and obey the Skipper's orders, maybe someday I'll be a Junior Petty Officer. MR HOWELL Gilligan, how would you like to be Secretary of the Navy? GILLIGAN Secretary of the Navy? You got to be kidding. I don't even know how to tie a knot. MR HOWELL You're just being modest. GILLIGAN No, I'm not. (points) Look. Gilligan and Mr. Howell look down at Gilligan's sneakers. GILLIGAN'S UNTIED SNEAKERS Gilligan's sneaker's laces are untied. BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL Well, I mean, whoever heard of the Secretary of the Navy tying his own knots? I'll assign some able-bodied seaman to perform such menial chores for you. GILLIGAN (skeptically) Where are we gonna find an able-bodied seaman? MR HOWELL (as an aside) Here comes one now. Gilligan is slightly startled as Skipper joins them. SKIPPER Gilligan, why are you talking to Howell? GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Skipper. MR HOWELL Don't be afraid, Gilligan. In a few hours, he'll be working for you. Mr. Howell winks at Gilligan. SKIPPER What? GILLIGAN He means -- MR HOWELL What I mean is, when I am President, Gilligan is going to be Secretary of the Navy. SKIPPER Secretary of the Navy? Gilligan is going to be Sec-- Skipper laughs. Gilligan looks hurt at Skipper's laugh at his expense. SKIPPER (cont'd) Well, why aren't you laughing, Gilligan? Skipper continues laughing. GILLIGAN I was thinking how nice it would be to have someone to tie my shoelaces. Skipper realizes that Gilligan might not be in his corner after all. He stops laughing, pauses, and looks down at Gilligan's untied laces. GILLIGAN'S UNTIED SHOES Gilligan, embarrassed by his inability to tie his own shoelaces, sheepishly covers one shoe with the other. BACK TO SCENE Skipper looks at Mr. Howell. Mr. Howell glaces down at Gilligan's sneakers and then looks away to avoid Skipper's gaze. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY The shower stall has been converted into an election booth. A sign reads "Election Booth." The Professor tests the pull cords on the shower curtain to be certain they work properly. PROFESSOR All right, folks. Seven pieces of paper have been initialed by all seven of us. These are the official ballots. Now think carefully before marking them, because what you write on your ballot counts. Now, who wants to vote first? Gilligan raises his hand with his index finger extended. GILLIGAN I do. Skipper grabs Gilligan's arm. SKIPPER Women and children first, that's what I stand for. MR HOWELL See what I mean? Who wants a President who would let children vote? MARY ANN I'll vote first, Professor. Mary Ann takes a ballot from the Professor. PROFESSOR Ginger, you're next. Professor hands a ballot to Ginger. MR HOWELL A star is born. Ginger smiles, pivots, and walks to the election booth. Skipper walks up to Mr. Howell. SKIPPER What was all that about? MR HOWELL Inside joke. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper pulls the curtain open and exits the election booth. Skipper walks over to the other side of the clearing. He brings Gilligan to the election booth. SKIPPER Gilligan, I want you to get in there and vote, but before you do, I want you to think about all the things that I've done for you. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. Gilligan turns to enter the election booth. Skipper grabs his arm and stops him. SKIPPER Oh, wait a minute, Gilligan. On second thought, maybe you better not think about all the things. Skipper laughs. Mr. Howell walks up to Gilligan and Skipper. MR HOWELL Remember, once you pull that cord, no man can tell you how to vote, Mister Secretary. Mr. Howell points to Gilligan's untied shoes. Mr. Howell folds his arms. Gilligan hesitates, turns, and enters the election booth. Mr. Howell and Skipper turn their backs to the election booth. Gilligan looks back with an annoyed expression at Mr. Howell and the Skipper. Gilligan fumbles with the cord to close the curtain. Instead of pulling the cord to close the curtain, Gilligan pulls the cord to dump water for the shower. The water pours out, drenching Gilligan. Mr. Howell and Skipper hear the water and turn toward the voting booth to see Gilligan soaked with water. Gilligan spits out water. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper holds the ballot box and dumps water out of it. He places it on a small table. Gilligan sits on an upright log. SKIPPER Quiet down now, everybody. There you are, Professor. Skipper removes a knife from his pocket and cuts through the vines securing the ballot box. MARY ANN Gilligan, you're shivering. GILLIGAN (shivering) I'll be all right in a m-m-minute. Mary Ann briskly rubs Gilligan to warm him up. The Professor removes the top from the ballot box and sets on the ground next to the table . PROFESSOR All right. Now, the first ballot -- The Professor digs in the ballot box and pulls out a ballot. PROFESSOR (cont'd) -- is for the Skipper! GILLIGAN Yea! Gilligan CLAPS. Skipper drapes a blanket over Gilligan's shoulders. SKIPPER This will keep you warm, little buddy. Professor pulls out another ballot. PROFESSOR The second ballot is for Mister Howell. GINGER (gleefully) Ooh! Ginger CLAPS. Gilligan CLAPS. GILLIGAN Yea. Skipper removes the blanket from Gilligan's shoulders and throws it over his own shoulders. Mr. Howell removes his suit coat and places it over Gilligan's shoulders. MR HOWELL Mister Secretary, warmsy-warmsy. Professor removes another ballot from the ballot box. PROFESSOR The third ballot is (pause) for the Skipper -- Mr. Howell removes his suit coat from Gilligan's shoulders and puts it back on. PROFESSOR (cont'd) -- who now leads, two-to-one. The fourth ballot is for Mister Howell. Ginger CLAPS. GINGER Oh, yippee! MRS HOWELL Isn't that exciting? Now it's two all. PROFESSOR The fifth ballot is (reads) a write-in vote for (pause) Gilligan? SKIPPER/MR HOWELL Let me see that! Skipper and Mr. Howell grab opposite edges of the wet ballot and tear it in half. They place the halves together to read the ballot. MR HOWELL Why, that's Lovey's handwriting. MRS HOWELL Yes, it is. I decided that it was time you let somebody else run everything. Then we could have that honeymoon you've been promising me all these years. MR HOWELL (to Mrs. Howell) Why, you romantic schemer, you. (pause) Later. (to Professor) Election. PROFESSOR The vote is tied at two and two. MARY ANN And one for Gilligan. PROFESSOR Well, I hardly think it's necessary to mention that, Mary Ann. SKIPPER Certainly, Mary Ann. Professor removes another ballot from the ballot box. PROFESSOR The sixth ballot is for (pause) Gilligan. MARY ANN Gilligan is my man, too. Gilligan is astonished that he has two votes. PROFESSOR The vote still stands at two votes for the Skipper and two for Mister Howell. MARY ANN And two write-in votes for Gilligan. Professor looks in the ballot box for another ballot. The castaways lean in. PROFESSOR The deciding vote (looks for ballot) is missing. MARY ANN Missing? GILLIGAN Oh, yeah. I've got it right here. Gilligan removes the ballot from his pants pocket and hands the ballot to the Professor. SKIPPER What's the matter, Gilligan? Isn't our ballot box good enough for you? Professor unfolds the ballot. GILLIGAN I was afraid it might get wet. SKIPPER That means that I win. The Professor reads the ballot. MR HOWELL That means I'm elected. PROFESSOR I'm sorry, gentlemen. You've both lost. SKIPPER Well, that's impossible. MR HOWELL Well, then who is President? All of them realize that if neither Skipper nor Mr. Howell had a majority of votes, Gilligan must have voted for himself and won the election. Mary Ann beams with admiration. SKIPPER Gilligan? The castaways are stunned. GILLIGAN President Gilligan. Gilligan shivers. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. OCEAN BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Broom and a small board as a dustpan in hand, Gilligan bends down and scoops up sand from the floor of the hut. He walks over to the door and tosses it outside just as Skipper enters. The sand hits Skipper in the belly. SKIPPER Gilligan, what are you doing? GILLIGAN I was cleaning up the White House. Skipper tries to grab the broom from Gilligan. SKIPPER Give me that broom. Gilligan and Skipper each grab the broom handle higher and higher until Gilligan puts his hand on the very top. Skipper finally grabs the broom away from Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) Is this any sort of a job for the President to be doing? GILLIGAN I don't know. I've never been a President before. Gilligan walks over to a small table. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Look, Skipper, I didn't mean to win the election. Gilligan picks up the table along with the coconut that sits on top of it. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Honest, I was on your side. Gilligan attempts to give the Skipper the table with the coconut on top as they back toward the door. SKIPPER There's no need to apologize. I just came by here to offer my congratulations. Now people have made their choice, and whether it is right or wrong, we're stuck with it. Skipper finally grasps the table. GILLIGAN Maybe we ought to count the votes again to make sure I won. Gilligan walks over to a table with a vase, flowers, a bowl, and a conch shell. SKIPPER There's no need to do that, either. Howell and I have counted them four times already. GILLIGAN Well, I sure feel awful about winning, especially when I wasn't even running. Gilligan adds the bowl and conch shell to the table that Skipper is holding. SKIPPER The fact is you did win, Gilligan, and that's why I'm here. I can hardly call myself a friend if I didn't give you a word of warning. Gilligan adds the flowers to Skipper's table. GILLIGAN A word of warning? About what? SKIPPER The power seekers. Mr. Howell appears through the hut window, sneakily rising to look inside the hut. SKIPPER (cont'd) Men who'll seek you out, call themselves friends. They'll flatter you, they'll fawn on you. These men are dangerous. All they want is a high position in your government. These men are not to be trusted and you've got to guard against them. GILLIGAN Guard against them how? SKIPPER Well, that's where I come in. You just leave it to me. That's part of my job as second-in-command. SKIPPER (cont'd) I can't tell you who these men are, but -- MR HOWELL Hello there. SKIPPER -- here comes one of them now. MR HOWELL I just stopped by to offer you my heartiest congratulations -- Gilligan extends his hand to shake. Instead of shaking hands, Mr. Howell removes his hat and turns his back to them. MR HOWELL (cont'd) -- on your rather shocking victory. Gilligan withdraws his unshaken hand and rubs it with the other. GILLIGAN Yeah, it was kind of a surprise to me, too. MR HOWELL Yes, the way I look at it, -- Mr. Howell points to Skipper, the gesture partially hidden by his hat. MR HOWELL (cont'd) -- it could have been worse. SKIPPER If you're finished, Howell, the President and I are busy setting up a new administration. MR HOWELL That's exactly why I'm here. SKIPPER That's exactly what I thought. MR HOWELL Oh, oh, Mister President, before I forget -- Mr. Howell reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small box. He opens the box and hands it to Gilligan. MR HOWELL (cont'd) -- here's a small, but terribly expensive, little token of my esteem. Gilligan takes the small box of solid gold cuff links. He turns to Skipper. GILLIGAN A box of esteemed tokens. Gilligan turns back to Mr. Howell. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Thanks, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL No, no, no. Mr. Howell demonstrates where Gilligan will have to be pierced to wear the solid gold cuff links. MR HOWELL (cont'd) You see, they're solid gold cuff links. You'll have to have your wrists pierced. GILLIGAN Mister Howell, I don't know how to thank you. SKIPPER (as an aside) That's what he's just about to tell you, Gilligan. MR HOWELL Well, I don't expect thanks. I came by to pay my respects, and to offer my humble service to whatever high office the President might designate. Gilligan smiles. SKIPPER Howell, I must admit, I'm surprised by your attitude. Mr. Howell bows. MR HOWELL The leader's wish is but my command. Skipper hands Mr. Howell the broom. SKIPPER Then, here. You can start by cleaning up the White House. That ought to be humble enough. MR HOWELL Just exactly who do you think you are? SKIPPER I'm the Vice President! MR HOWELL The Vice President? Well, how did you get that job? SKIPPER By getting here before you did! Gilligan holds up the open box of cuff links. GILLIGAN Mister Howell, do you want your cuff links back? MR HOWELL Do you think I'm the kind of man who would take back a bribe, sir? GILLIGAN I'd like to give you something in return. MR HOWELL Well, I expect to get something in return. What exactly do you have open? Gilligan points toward his sneakers. GILLIGAN Do you know how to make a good knot? Gilligan turns to the Skipper. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper, what kind of job can we give Mister Howell? Skipper puts his arm around Gilligan's shoulders. SKIPPER We have, uh, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State -- Mr. Howell frowns at each suggestion. GILLIGAN Yeah, you could be one of those secretaries. You know how to take shorthand typing? MR HOWELL No. You see, Mister President, I think with my background the ideal job for me would be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Skipper removes his arm from Gilligan's shoulders. SKIPPER But that's a very important position. Have you had any legal experience? MR HOWELL The government has convicted me six times on antitrust suits and I've been investigated every year for income tax evasion. GILLIGAN That's good enough for me. How about you, Skipper? SKIPPER Any man who can stay out of jail with that record like that's got to know something about the law. MR HOWELL Indeed I do. Now the first thing on my agenda -- Mr. Howell looks around to see if anyone is listening. MR HOWELL (cont'd) (sotto) -- is to investigate a plot to overthrow the government. GILLIGAN What plot to overthrow the government? MR HOWELL The one I started right after the election. Mr. Howell laughs heartily. MR HOWELL (cont'd) See you at the inaugural luau, Mister President. On his way out of the hut, Mr. Howell swats Gilligan on the rear with his hat. Astonished, Gilligan's jaw drops. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - NIGHT The Howells, Ginger, and Professor are seated at the dining table with Gilligan. Behind them is the hut. Skipper stands to introduce Gilligan. SKIPPER It is my honor to introduce to you a man known to us all, a man respected for his courage, his dedication of duty, his leadership. A true giant among men. Our President, Gilligan! MR HOWELL Yeah, Mister President. Mary Ann exits the hut and brings out a tray of food. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Bravo, bravo. Speech, speech, speech. GILLIGAN Ladies and gentlemen, and honored guests. I accept the responsibility that you've given me -- Mary Ann interrupts with the tray of food. MARY ANN Come on, everybody, eat, please, while it's, while it's still hot. But -- Mary Ann realizes she interrupted President Gilligan's speech. MARY ANN (cont'd) -- Oh, I'm sorry, Gilligan. I mean, Mister President. Mary Ann sits down at the dining table. GILLIGAN That's okay, folks. You go ahead and finish dinner. I -- I just jotted down a few things I wanted to say and -- Gilligan looks over the dining table for this speech. GILLIGAN (cont'd) It was right here a minute ago. Mr. Howell wipes his mouth with Gilligan's speech as if it were a napkin. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Mister Howell, excuse me, but that napkin, I think it's my speech. MR HOWELL Oh, yes. It tastes a little inky. Gilligan clears his throat. GILLIGAN First of all -- Ginger and Professor each peel a banana. MR HOWELL Uh-uh, would you pass me that guava sauce? GILLIGAN Sure, Mister Howell. Skipper hands a small cup of guava sauce to Gilligan, who passes it to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL Shot of it, please. GILLIGAN There you are, sir. MR HOWELL Thank you. GILLIGAN You're welcome. Now -- SKIPPER Would you pass this down, please? Thank you. Skipper hands a plate to Gilligan to pass. GILLIGAN You're welcome. Gilligan realizes the plate is hot. GILLIGAN (cont'd) It's hot. Here, Professor, Professor, here! Gilligan hands the plate to the Professor. PROFESSOR Thank you, Gilligan. GILLIGAN (to Professor) You're welcome. (to castaways) Well, now down to the important business. As you all know, our water supply is getting short and we have to pitch in and build a well. MRS HOWELL Oh, I wish I knew who cooked these jellied sand dabs. GINGER Oh, I did, Missus Howell. Do you like them? MRS HOWELL Oh, they're delicious. Thurston, you must try them. You'd believe you were at Antoine's. Ginger touches Mr. Howell's arm and grips it gently. GINGER (seductively) Yes, you must try my jellied sand dabs. GILLIGAN Now about the jellied sand-- I mean, about digging the well. Now look, folks, if we all pitch in, I figure we can dig that well in -- Gilligan gestures with his index finger. GILLIGAN (cont'd) -- one day. Now -- SKIPPER Ah, this is the best meal I've had since I've been on the island. MARY ANN Thank you, Skipper. SKIPPER I've gotta take a walk. Skipper and Mary Ann get up from the dining table. MARY ANN Ginger. Ginger, please give me that recipe when you get a chance. GINGER Oh, I will, Mary Ann. GILLIGAN Digging the well should go -- The Howells get up from the dining table and exit. GILLIGAN (cont'd) We have to have fresh water. Please, Mister and Missus Howell. Finally Ginger and Professor get up and exit. Gilligan tries to get their attention and climbs up on the dining table and his hands and knees. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Ginger -- Professor -- Professor, as Secretary of Agriculture, I think it's necessary that you should find out where we should dig the well. Gilligan is left alone, wondering where everybody went. FLIP TO: INT. SUPPLY HUT - DAY Gilligan paces in his Presidential office. A flag made of a tropical patterned cloth hangs on a pole. A long desk has a sign reading "Mr. President" at one end. At the other end is a chair and a writing surface. Gilligan picks up a conch shell and blows into it, BLASTING like a horn. Gilligan sits down at his desk, pulls out the quill from the ink well, and pretends to write. Mrs. Howell enters. She holds a notepad and wears secretarial eyeglasses. MRS HOWELL You rang, Mister President? GILLIGAN Yeah, Missus Howell. It's almost after four o'clock. (glances at watch) Has anybody come to see me? MRS HOWELL No, they haven't, Mister President. GILLIGAN Maybe somebody stopped by while you were away from your desk. MRS HOWELL I haven't left that oil drum all day, Mister President. GILLIGAN What's my schedule for tomorrow? Mrs. Howell checks her NOTEPAD. MRS HOWELL I'll check here. Well, there's nothing in the morning, (cheerfully) but in the afternoon, (deadpan) you haven't got anything. GILLIGAN What time is my Cabinet meeting? MRS HOWELL Five o'clock, but the Vice President canceled it. He had a fishing date with the Chief Justice. GILLIGAN Where's the rest of my Cabinet? MRS HOWELL They're all swimming in the lagoon. All except the Secretary of Health and Welfare. GILLIGAN Good, what's she doing? MRS HOWELL Her hair. Frustrated, Gilligan throws down the quill. Gilligan stands, and pounds his fist down on the desk, hitting the ink well and spilling it over his hand and the desk. GILLIGAN Well, somebody's gotta dig that well. Gilligan looks down at his hand covered in ink. MRS HOWELL You're right, Mister President. You're absolutely right. FLIP TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper rearranges crates, boxes, and other items in the hut. Gilligan carries a bamboo shovel and enters through the hut door. GILLIGAN Skipper, you got a minute? SKIPPER Sure, Gilligan, come on in. That is, Mister President. GILLIGAN Skipper, I need your help. I'm worried. I'm real worried about that well. SKIPPER You look worried. GILLIGAN I do? SKIPPER Sure do. And frankly, I've been worried about you. GILLIGAN You have? SKIPPER Yes, but I don't want you to worry about that. You've enough to worry about without worrying about the way you look, which is terrible. GILLIGAN Really? Gilligan feels his face, as if he can feel "looking terrible" with his hands. SKIPPER But, Gilligan, never mind that. Take a look at this hut. Now, does this look like the office of a Vice President? GILLIGAN No, Skipper, it doesn't. SKIPPER It is beneath our dignity, isn't it? GILLIGAN Yes, sir, it is. SKIPPER Right. Skipper picks up a set of crates and hands them to Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now can you help me with this junk? Gilligan takes the crates. GILLIGAN Sure, Skipper, but about the well, Skipper... Skipper hands Gilligan a pair of crates. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper? About the ... Skipper stacks two vegetable boxes on top of the crates that Gilligan is holding. SKIPPER What seems to be the problem? GILLIGAN Skipper, our old water supply is running low and we gotta dig a new well quick. Skipper stacks two more vegetable boxes on top. SKIPPER That's not too heavy for you, is it? GILLIGAN (straining) No. Skipper adds a naval rope to Gilligan's burden. SKIPPER Just put this rope on there and if you would step over in the corner here -- Skipper turns Gilligan and moves him to another corner of the hut. SKIPPER (cont'd) -- we'll put it right in that corner. That's it. There we go, Gilligan. GILLIGAN About the water situation, sir. SKIPPER Ooh, you're having a problem with the water? GILLIGAN Yeah, Skipper, same problem. SKIPPER Wait a minute, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Yeah? SKIPPER I got an idea. GILLIGAN Yeah? SKIPPER I think I'll put my desk over here. Would you bring this back over and put it on this wall? GILLIGAN Wherever you want, Skipper. But we gotta make a decision about the well. SKIPPER Now, Mister President, have you made any decisions about the well? GILLIGAN Uh-huh. SKIPPER And what are you going to do? GILLIGAN I'm gonna drop these boxes. Gilligan drops the crates, vegetable boxes, and rope. As they tumble to the floor, they spill over onto the Skipper's foot. SKIPPER Oof! GILLIGAN And I'm gonna go see the Chief Justice. SKIPPER (pained) Oh, Gilligan. GILLIGAN About the well. Gilligan exits the hut. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Mr. Howell snoozes on his bed with his hat over this face. Gilligan enters between the blankets covering the door, shovel in hand. Gilligan removes Mr. Howell's HAT to talk with him. Mr. Howell is startled and rouses. GILLIGAN I hate to disturb you, Chief Justice. MR HOWELL Well, that's all right. Never, never too busy to talk to the -- the President. GILLIGAN I want to ask you your opinion about that well we have to dig. MR HOWELL Oh, the well. Well, I've been lying here and giving that a lot of consideration. Now, the similar case of Fletcher versus Bronson, you see, the Municipal Court upheld a previous ruling... Gilligan frowns. MR HOWELL (cont'd) ... and uh, and found for the defendant. And even after the case was appealed, the court refused to reverse the decision in spite of the new evidence. I've taken all of that into consideration. GILLIGAN What have you decided to do? MR HOWELL And I've decided to give it a little more thought. Mr. Howell takes his hat back from Gilligan and puts it over his face. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Nighty night. Gilligan frowns in disappointment at Mr. Howell's answer. FLIP TO: INT. GIRLS HUT - DAY Gilligan, shovel in hand, enters through blankets. GILLIGAN Hi. I hate to barge in like this, but I figure maybe you can help me. I went to see the Vice President at first but he was so busy fixing up his office that he couldn't help me and I went to see the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court but he gots lots of problems, too. I mean, in the case of Fletcher and Bronson and even have to appeal it and it got very complicated so I was hoping that something you could do. Gilligan inhales and exhales. GINGER (sultry) Let me see. There must be something I could do. GILLIGAN About the well. Ginger kisses her finger and moves to press it to Gilligan's lips. Gilligan turns away and hits his head on a bamboo post and slides to the ground. Ginger watches him slide down and then Ginger gives an aside glance and shrugs. FLIP TO: EXT. WELL SITE - DAY Mary Ann and Skipper listen to President Gilligan. Mary Ann plays with her ponytail. Gilligan stands in the well hole and digs the well. GILLIGAN I'm gonna make this meeting short as possible. I know we've all had a busy day. Mr. Howell raises his glass as a toast. MR HOWELL Hear, hear. GILLIGAN Unless the well is finished, we're going to run out of drinking water. SKIPPER That's very true, Mister President. We certainly do need a well. GILLIGAN That's exactly my thinking, Skipper. MARY ANN And we're behind you all the way, Mister President. Gilligan continues digging. GINGER You're the best President we ever elected. GILLIGAN Thanks, Ginger. GINGER (to Mr. Howell) I mean, even if I don't get a star on my dressing room door. MR HOWELL Uh, we're with you, sir. Mr. Howell holds a glass and slightly raises it in a toast. GILLIGAN Then how about helping me dig the well? MARY ANN Oh, I can't help you, Mister President. I'm in the midst of settling a strike. Mary Ann looks in Ginger's direction. GILLIGAN What strike? MARY ANN Oh, the Secretary of Health and Welfare won't help me in the kitchen any more. GINGER Well, I'm not on strike. I have my own work to do now. How can I wash the dishes and build a hospital at the same time? GILLIGAN A hospital? What for? We don't even have a doctor! GINGER Well, but when the hospital's finished, I'm going to build a medical school. MR HOWELL Don't count on me, sir. I'm involved in a very serious judicial matter. GILLIGAN What are you working on now, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL Your impeachment! SKIPPER What? You're trying to impeach the President? On what grounds? MR HOWELL Well, he accepted a bribe from a sort of a power mad favor seeker! That's what it is. SKIPPER I never gave him a dime! MR HOWELL Well, I did! I gave him a pair of solid gold cuff links! SKIPPER That's a pretty serious charge, Mister Howell. Do you have any witnesses? MR HOWELL Well, I certainly do. I happen to have five of them! SKIPPER That's impossible! I was the only one in the room at that time that he took the bribe. MR HOWELL A-ha! There you are. Thank you very much. I'm gonna call you as a witness at the impeachment proceedings. SKIPPER Why do you want to impeach a President that's doing such a good job for us? MR HOWELL Oh, nonsense! There's no water down there. GILLIGAN Mister Howell, I've had it. You don't have to impeach me. I quit! Gilligan takes the shovel and drives it hard to the bottom of the well hole. Water sprays out of the well hole, drenching all of them. Mary Ann excitedly hugs Skipper. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. ISLAND BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. CAMP - DAY The castaways sit at the dining table. Gilligan stands up. SKIPPER Quiet down now, folks. President Gilligan would like to say a few words. Gilligan holds several pages of notes. GILLIGAN Thank you. First of all, I want to thank you for attending this Cabinet meeting. GINGER You're welcome. MRS HOWELL We love to be here. PROFESSOR Delighted to be here. GILLIGAN And now that we've solved the water problem I think we ought to get to work on our next project: a lookout tower. SKIPPER Lookout tower? That's an excellent idea, Mister President. MR HOWELL Oh, you mean a high-rise sort of thing? MRS HOWELL That sounds marvelous. What is it? GILLIGAN If we build a real tall lookout tower a ship or a plane might spot us and we'd be rescued. SKIPPER Excellent. The castaways exclaim at Gilligan's grand idea. SKIPPER (cont'd) We could be rescued. PROFESSOR Good, good, wonderful, Gilligan. GILLIGAN I'm glad you all like the idea. I have the bamboo poles and vines right there. (points) And we can begin construction right now. Mister Howell -- Mr. Howell stands up. MR HOWELL Oh, no, I have to go, Mr. President. A lot of cases on the docket. Supreme Court decisions can't wait, you know. GILLIGAN Missus Howell? Mrs. Howell stands up and follows Mr. Howell. MRS HOWELL Um, I have to go and take dictation from Mister Howell. The Howells exit. GILLIGAN Professor, do you think -- The Professor gets up from the dining table. PROFESSOR I'm sorry, Mister President. I've got a scientific report to finish. The Professor exits. GILLIGAN Mary Ann? Mary Ann gets up from the dining table. MARY ANN I think I'd better check the food supply. Mary Ann exits. GILLIGAN Ginger, do you -- Ginger gets up too. GINGER I have to wash my hair, Gilligan. Ginger exits. GILLIGAN Skipper, do you think -- Skipper stands up too. SKIPPER Well, it's just the idea, Mister President. You've done some wonderful things for the island. And everybody's behind you a hundred percent. GILLIGAN I sure hope I can get re-elected. Skipper pats Gilligan on the back and laughs heartily. SKIPPER Oh, I'm sure you will be. Do a good job, Gilligan. Skipper exits. GILLIGAN Now, we all -- Gilligan realizes no one else is left. He sits down and looks disappointed that everyone abandoned him. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY FADE OUT. THE END 
Episode #37, "Gilligan's Mother-In-Law" (A native family from another island comes seeking a husband for their lovely robust daughter) A special thanks goes out to Peggy and Garry for sending us this script. This isn't the entire script, but you can print it out and follow the first few pages to this episode. Garry was actually on the set while filming the Gilligan series, and he told us that they use to ad lib A LOT! He was only 10 at the time and wasn't allowed to meet any of the girls. However, his two older brother's did meet them and had a blast! (Sorry Garry) We hope to have a full story about the times on the set soon. Until then, enjoy.

He is facing away from the Lagoon with his hat pulled over his eyes.  In the distance the sight and sound of a helicopter appear as it makes it's way over the Lagoon.

(pause) Ramoo we're going hunting!  RAMOO What you not hear? No game on island.  KINCAID Perhaps not the four legged kind.

I gave them our exact position and the boat will be here tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.  At the news of the boats arrival, all the castaways start making ad lib comments of excitement.  SKIPPER (EXCITEDLY YELLING) …man when I get back I'm going right to an Italian restaurant, and I'm gonna have eight or ten pizzas, six dozen meat balls, two piles of spaghetti and then I'm going to have dinner!!  The castaways start to leave the hut area as a group still add libbing.  MRS HOWELL I don't know what to wear!  As the castaways leave, the camera pans and zooms in on Kincaid.  KINCAID Well Ramoo, which one will be our victim? The skipper? The Professor? Mary Ann?  RAMOO Ramoo think not difference.  KINCAID Oh come on man where's your sense of the hunt?  I want a quarry that a…will present me with a challenge.  Somebody that's nimble, agile.  RAMOO Who that one?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON KINCAID  KINCAID I don't know. I'll have to question each and every one of them to find out who will give me the best run for my money.  FADE TO: INT - HOWELL'S HUT - DAY  Mrs. Howell is making preparations to leave the island and is packing her suitcase with her belongings. Mr. Howell stands near her ready to help.  MRS HOWELL I don't know how we're going to explain to our friends that we spent several years with people who aren't even in the social register.  MR HOWELL Well a…our friends will just have to realize my dear that one is marooned one must take pot luck!  Mr. Howell takes the suitcase from Mrs. Howell and with great effort places it down.  MR HOWELL There you go…oh that's heavy! You have your jewelry in there.  Kincaid enters the Howells hut carrying a high powered bolt action rifle with a scope.  MR HOWELL Ah…ah…goo…hello there Mr. Kincaid.  Kincaid sees that Mr. Howell is having a little difficulty.  KINCAID Need any help?  MR HOWELL No…no…no…no…we Howells make a point of…a keeping fit.  MRS HOWELL As an example to the little people.  MR HOWELL Yes the last cotillion we attended, Mrs. Howell danced every dance and was hardly out of breath!  MRS HOWELL You know Mr. Howell's office is on the second floor and sometimes he doesn't even take the elevator!  MR HOWELL A sound mind and a sound body.  Mr. Howell notices the rifle Kincaid is holding and reaches out to take it.  MR HOWELL My that is a beaut…hand tooled…you didn't get that at a discount.  Mr. Howell examines the rifle and points it at Mrs. Howell who is shocked to see Her husband holding her at gun point.  MRS HOWELL Ah!  Mr. Howell appears rather pleased with himself at her reaction.  MR HOWELL Almost caught her on the rise!  Kincaid takes back the rifle.  KINCAID Are you a…a hunter Mr. Howell?  MR HOWELL Well no…but I a went on a…a tiger hunt once. I shot three of the ugly beasts in fifteen minutes.  KINCAID Three in fifteen minutes, why that's utterly fantastic! You must have been pleased!  MR HOWELL I was but the directors of the zoo were infuriated!  Kincaid looks at Mr. Howell with a deep sense of disapproval and disappointment. Mr. Howell starts to leave the hut discussing his unorthodox approach to fishing.  MR HOWELL I went fishing in the aquarium I thought they weren't pleased I'll tell you that…  Kincaid has heard enough and starts to leave the Howell's hut all the while making notes in his ever present note pad.  FLIP TO: INT - MARY ANN & GINGER'S HUT - DAY  Mary Ann and Ginger are in their hut discussing going home, while Kincaid looks on.  MARY ANN I can hardly wait to get back to Kansas. Why the first thing I'm going to do is bake an apple pie, and then I'm going to milk the cows and then I'm going to feed the chickens!  KINCAID Well you farm people have to stay in good condition.  MARY ANN Oh we certainly do! You know I once ran a hundred yards in fifteen seconds!  KINCAID Fifteen seconds?!  MARY ANN Oh yes.  I was being chased by a bull!  GINGER Oh that's nothing.  I once ran a hundred yards in ten seconds.  KINCAID Ten seconds?!  GINGER Huh hum, I was being chased by a Hollywood producer!  After hearing that, Kincaid is about as happy with Ginger as he was with Mr. Howell and makes notes in his note pad.  FLIP TO: INT – GIILGIAN'S & SKIPPER'S HUT - DAY  Kincaid is standing while making notes in his note pad as he converses with the Professor sitting at a table.  KINCAID …P H D at twenty five?! Well it sounds like you didn't have much time for sports.  PROFESSOR Well I don't want to sound immodest but I was the number one man on my team!  KINCAID Really?!…Baseball?  Professor shakes his head no.  KINCAID Basketball?  Professor shakes his head no again.  KINCAID Football?  Once again the Professor shakes his head no.  KINCAID Hockey?  For the last time the Professor indicates no and then finally gives in.  PROFESSOR Chess!  As with Mr. Howell and Ginger, Kincaid is seen as being not too please with the Professor's answer. He makes further notes in his note pad.  The skipper and Gilligan are standing near by listening to Kincaid's and the Professor's conversation. Kincaid turns his attention to the skipper.  KINCAID How about you skipper?  SKIPPER Well Mr. Kincaid football was my game in High school. I played the line.  KINCAID Oh…what position?  SKIPPER No position…I WAS the line!  The skipper reliving his high school days, gets down on the floor taking up a stance as if he was on the front line of a football team. Gilligan takes an obvious look behind the skipper. Kincaid continues to make notes in his pad.  SKIPPER I'll never forget…  GILLIGAN You got a pretty good back field too!  SKIPPER (Sarcastically) Thanks a lot Gilligan! It's easy for you to talk, look at the way your built! I'm mean he's young and wirey. He can run as fast as a rabbit, climb a tree like a monkey.  Why trying to keep up with him is impossible!  At those words, Kincaid puts on his devious look again as he sees Gilligan in a different light while he makes notes on his note pad.  FAD TO: EXT – HUT CLEARING - DAY  The castaways are all in the clearing near the skipper's and Gilligan's hut setting up a going away party. A banner over the door reads; "FAREWELL TO OUR ISLAND". Mr. Howell appears to be directing the activity. Mary Ann and Ginger are bringing out items for the party.  MR HOWELL There you are…put that over there girls.  Mr. Howell sees Kincaid and Ramoo approaching.  MR HOWELL Oh…oh here comes our guest of honor now. Remember skipper?  SKIPPER Everybody now…  All the castaways turn their attention to Kincaid and Ramoo as they start to sing…  ALL For he's a jolly good fellow! For he's a jolly good fellow! For he's a jolly good fellow! Which no body can deny!  All the castaways start to clap.  SKIPPER Speech!  MR HOWELL Speech, speech, speech!  KINCAID Thanks you, thank you very much! I hope you can feel the same way after my little announcement.  Ladies and gentleman I have chosen one of you to go on a little hunting trip.  The castaways appear surprised and delighted with the idea.  MR HOWELL Here here!  PROFESSOR Mr. Kincaid there isn't any game on this island!  KINCAID Oh yes there is, you see I'm planning on hunting one of you.  The castaways are no longer so delighted.  GILLIGIAN Hey that's kind of funny.  SKIPPER Gilligan, he's not smiling.  MARY ANN Well that's ridiculous. People don't hunt people.  MRS HOWELL Mr. Kincaid this joke is in extremely poor taste!   KINCAID Madame, I assure you I'm not joking.  PROFESSOR Do you intend to hunt one of us, and then gun your victim down in cold blood?!  KINCAID Very well put Professor. As added incentive to your participation in this adventure, if the one I'm hunting can elude me for twenty-four hours, I'll see that your all returned to civilization.  The castaways now have a look of doom on their faces. Kincaid starts to look at each castaway in turn as he makes his decision.  GINGER But…but I'm a girl!  KINCAID That's quite obvious.  Kincaid looks next at Mary Ann  MARY ANN Me!?  KINCAID My dear, shooting you would be like shooting an Easter bunny.  Kincaid then fixes his gaze on Mrs. Howell.  KINCAID As for you Madame.  MRS HOWELL You wouldn't dare!  KINCAID Don't tempt me.  But I plan to start this hunt before noon, and I'm sure at that early hour your blue blood wouldn't be circulating.  Mrs. Howell is upset at being insulted.  MRS HOWELL I never heard such nerve!  Why for something important I can get up as early as anyone else!  Mr. Howell realizes how absurd Mrs. Howells comment is and steps in.  MR HOWELL Lovey, if the man says your blood doesn't circulate don't argue!  Kincaid, hearing Mr. Howell turns his attention to him.  KINCAID As for you, I'd love to let some hot air out of your stuffed shirt!  Kincaid then focuses on the Professor.  KINCAID Over here we have a chess player. By the time he's figuring out his next move I'd have him in my bag!  Kincaid then spots the skipper.  SKIPPER Now look Kincaid, this is a lot of nonsense!  KINCAID Skipper! Your too big a target.  Gilligan then assesses the situation and is relieved that no one was selected.  GILLIGAN I'm glad it's not you or Ginger or Mary Ann or Mr. Or Mrs. Howell or the Professor.  Gilligan now realizes that he's the only one Kincaid has left out.  GILLIGAN You mean it's…  Gilligan then silently points at himself.  KINCAID Ramoo, take him away.  Ramoo takes Giligan by the arm and starts to lead him off.  SKIPPER Now you be careful with him, that's my little buddy!  Ramoo, on seeing the skipper coming at him sticks the skipper with the tip of his spear, as the skipper lets out a yelp of pain. Ramoo leads Gilligan off.  The skipper and the professor are left behind and the professor waits for Kincaid to disappear around the hut.  PROFESSOR Skipper, when I get a chance, I'll make a break for the helicopter and radio for help.  SKIPPER That's a great idea Professor, well show that big gun he can't push us around…  Kincaid then pops back form around the hut.  KINCAID Have any ideas about using the radio forget it, I have the tubes.  Kincaid can be seen with some radio tubes in his hand.  FADE TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Gilligan is seen laying on a table eating a steak dinner as Ramoo gives him a leg massage. Kincaid is present and is looking on holding his rifle.  GILLLGIAN Mr. Kincaid you sure had me fooled. I mean about shooting me tomorrow. Isn't that a laugh!  KINCAID Yes it does have it's humorous side.  Kincaid starts laughing as Mr. Howell enters the hut. He stares for a moment at Kincaid.  MR HOWELL I want a word with you Kincaid.  Mr. Howell goes over to Gilligan laying on the table and eating steak dinner.  MR HOWELL How are you my boy?  GILLGIAN Oh I'm great Mr. Howell. You have Mr. Kincaid all wrong. They're treating me like a prince. I have steak and a leg massage. I'm living it up.  MR HOWELL Wa…Can't you figure out why my boy!?  GILLIGAN Sure! They like me!  MR HOWELL Like you!? They're fatting you up like a Thanksgiving day Turkey and tomorrows Thanksgiving day!  GILLIGAN Did you hear that Mr. Kincaid? They still believe it. Go on, tell'em your not going to do anything. (pause)  Kincaid just looks on without saying a word.  GILLIGAN Mr. Kincaid? Tell them your not… Mr. Kincaid say something. Say anything Mr. Kincaid!  Gilligan tries to get up off the table and Ramoo forces him back down.  MR HOWELL Look ah, Mr. Kincaid, this young fellow means a lot to me, say ah one hundred thousand dollars?  KINCAID No.  MR HOWELL No…ah…Three Hundred Thousand?  KINCAID No.  MR HOWELL Well let's not quival with small change. What about a half a million and a tip for your friend with the bad headache?  KINCAID You don't seem to understand. I'm not interested in money.  MR HOWELL You are sick!  Mr. Howell leaves the hut as Kincaid turns his attention back to Gilligan.  FADE TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT - LATER THAT EVENING  Gilligan is seen pacing back and forth and appears rather forlorn about being shot. Kincaid watches him and tries to cheer him up.  KINCAID Conserve some of that energy for tomorrow, don't burn yourself out. And stop looking so glum, after all you've got a fifty-fifty chance.  Gilligan has a look of hope on his face.  GILLIGAN Fifty-fifty!?  KINCAID Yes, whether you get it through the heart or between the eyes.  TRANSCRIBERS NOTE: At this point it has been said that the scene continues with Ginger bringing in drinks to Kincaid laced with some drug to make him sleep. Gilligan ends up getting the drugged drink instead and falls fast asleep. I have never seen this scene so can not verify it.  CUT TO: EXT - CLEARING - MORNING  It's the next day and Gilligan is seen standing alone looking very frightened as Kincaid goes over the rules of the hunt again  KINCAID You know the rules. If you can survive for twenty-four hours, you not only save your life, but the lives of your friends.  Kincaid takes his watch and makes some adjustments as well as sets the timer.   KINCAID It's set to go off at exactly this time tomorrow. And just to be sporting, I'm going to give you a fifteen minute head start. (pause) GO!!  Gilligan is shocked into action and jumps straight up in the air and in the process looses both his sneakers. He starts to run and realizes he's left his sneakers behind and goes back to pick them up.  GILLIGAN Did you say fifteen or sixteen minutes?  KINCAID You just lost ten seconds.  GILLIGAN Oops!  Gilligan turns and starts to run with his sneakers still in his hand. Kincaid is looking at Gilligan through the scope of the rifle with the crosshairs aligned dead center on Gilligan's back.  KINCAID (VERBALLY) Bang!  We cut back to Gilligan running for his life through the jungle as we…   FADE OUT      ACT TWO FADE IN:  EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan is seen running through the jungle and is obviously getting tired.  GILLIGAN (out of breath) I've got to keep running, I'm exhausted. He's going to blast me into confetti. How long have I been running?  Gilligan stops to look at his watch.  GILLIGAN (out of breath) Five minutes! He hasn't even started after me yet.  CUT TO: EXT - CAVE CLEARING - DAY  The other castaways have been placed in a cave with bamboo bars as a prison. Ramoo is finishing tying a vine on the bamboo door to secure the prisoners.  KINCAID Well I must leave now. Somewhere out there in the jungle your little friend is waiting. (pause) And I wouldn't want to disappoint him. Guard them well Ramoo.  Ramoo Yes sir boss.  Kincaid turns and heads out into the jungle in search of Gilligan.  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan is still trying to outdistance Kincaid through the jungle and is getting very tired. He stops near a large pile of leaves to take a rest.  GILLIGAN It'll serve Kincaid right if I die of sun stroke before he kills me. That is if I don't die of thirst before I die of sun stoke before I die of gun shot…Oh I'm so thirsty I got to get some water.  Gilligan is searching the area for water. As he's looking, he looks up to see Kincaid walking towards him. He makes the decision to frantically burrow under the pile of leaves to hide form Kincaid.  Kincaid is unaware of Gilligan's presence and decides to take a break from the heat by sitting down on the pile of leaves.  As he does so, he takes off his canteen, unscrews the cap, takes a drink. When he's done he screws the cap back on and then sets it on the ground where Gilligan ends up seeing it.  Gilligan is aware of Kincaid's presence above him, but due to his extreme thirst, attempts to quietly take the canteen anyway.  Kincaid suddenly notices the canteen moving and realizes he's not alone.  Kincaid tries to grab Gilligan but Gilligan bolts out from under the Pile of Leaves and knocks Kincaid off balance in the process. Gilligan runs at full speed down the path. By the time Kincaid finally regains his balance, Gilligan is long gone.  FLIP TO: INT - CAVE - DAY  The remaining castaways are sitting in the makeshift prison that is being guarded by Ramoo.  GINGER Poor Gilligan, eleven hours and he's still running.  PROFESSOR I'd be happy if he was still alive and walking.  MRS HOWELL Or Crawling!  MARY ANN Now lets not give up hope. We've got to believe Gilligan is still alive and he's going to stay that way.  GINGER Your not Mary Ann your Mary Poppins.  PROFESSOR Never the less she's right! What we need is positive thinking.  SKIPPER Yeah well a bullet hasn't been made yet with Gilligan's name on it. That guy'll never catch'em. My little buddy is too fast!  MR HOWELL Yeah.  PROFESSOR And cunning!  MR HOWELL Yeah.  PROFESSOR And Shifty!  MR HOWELL Yeah,  SKIPPER And Smart!  MR HOWELL Three out of four that's not bad.  SKIPPER Yeah.  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF PALM TREE AND OCEAN VIEW  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Kincaid is seen walking through the jungle in search of Gilligan. Gilligan is still evading Kincaid and decides to climb a tree in order to possibly hide.  Kincaid sees Gilligan and starts to take aim through the scope. Gilligan sees Kincaid and grabs the first vine he finds to swing away. Kincaid is just about ready to fire when Gilligan makes his leap, but instead of swinging away from Kincaid, he swings right into Kincaid knocking him down. Gilligan makes his get away as Kincaid is picking himself up and runs in Gilligan's direction.  FLIP TO: EXT - CAVE - DAY  Ramoo is still guarding the cave where the remaining castaways are being held captive.  SKIPPER Ramoo!  Ramoo is not interested in the skipper and lets out a disapproving sound.  RAMOO Aaaaaaaah!  CUT TO: INT - CAVE - MORNING  All the castaways are in the cave but none are looking any the better for it.  SKIPPER There's one good thing about Ramoo still guarding us that's the fact Gilligan got through the night.  PROFESSOR We've got to escape and go help him!  GINGER (depressingly) Six more hours.  MR HOWELL I've got an idea.  Why don't we just tunnel our way out of here!  PROFESSOR Not through twenty-five feet of rock!? Why with even dynamite and a steam shovel it would take a month!  MR HOWELL Oh details, details I just hate to be bothered with details!  SKIPPER I'm afraid we're stuck right here.  MRS HOWELL Oh pooh there must be someway we can help poor Gilligan.  MARY ANN Oh I can't just sit still, I've never felt so useless in my whole life!  SKIPPER Well think of me! I'm three times as big as you are I feel three times as useless!  Mrs. Howell looks as if she has an idea and heads for the bamboo door of their cell and proceeds to go outside.  CUT TO: EXT - CAVE - MORNING  Ramoo is still sitting on a large rock as we see Mrs. Howell approach from behind him. Ramoo notices Mrs. Howell and grabs his spear and thrusts it in her direction making her stop.  RAMOO Stop! Where you go!?  MRS HOWELL Put that silly thing away. I'm sure your mother would never approve of such conduct!  RAMOO No have mother!  MRS HOWELL Awe that's sad. But you must remember you're an uninvited guest on this island, and you do have certain social obligations.  RAMOO No have ogligations!  Ramoo is still holding the spear at Mrs. Howell. The rest of the castaways are watching at a safe distance. Mr. Howell is getting increasingly nervous as he watches his wife confront Ramoo.  MRS HOWELL Didn't anyone ever tell you that it's rude to point!  MR HOWELL Lovey! Lovey! That man is a barbarian!  MRS HOWELL Oh fiddle sticks! Any one can learn good manners.  Ramoo makes more menacing gestures with his spear.  RAMOO Do not make Ramoo stab you!  MR HOWELL Lovey don't! Please!  MRS HOWELL If you ever want to get into high society, you'll have to read a book on etiquette!   With that said, Mrs. Howell pushes the spear out of the way and starts walking past Ramoo.  Ramoo takes offense and raises his spear. Just as he's about to throw the spear, the Skipper and the others run out of the cave. The skipper puts a wrestling hole on Ramoo's spear throwing arm and subdues him.  SKIPPER Quick Professor a rope! I think we've been liberated!  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan is still running through the jungle after evading Kincaid all night.  He is obviously exhausted and out of breath. He decides to sit down on a large rock. As he rests, the sound of an Owl is heard coming from a nearby tree. Hoo, hoo...  GILLIGAN The question isn't who. I know who's gonna get it! The question is when where and how!  CUT TO: KINCAID - SAME JUNGLE AREA  Kincaid has just seen Gilligan sitting on the rock. He raises his rife and takes aim through his scope. As he starts to pull the trigger…  CUT to: PREVIOUS SHOT  GILLIGAN Oh skipper anybody!  As Gilligan in desperation leans forward, a shot rings out and hits the rock behind Gilligan leaving a shower of splinters of rock. Gilligan, now realizes he's been shot at, takes off at full speed into the jungle. Kincaid greatly disappointed takes off after Gilligan. The Skipper and the Professor are coming into a clearing and see Gilligan running for his life. They see that Kincaid has a good bead on Gilligan. Kincaid raises his rifle, takes aim and…  SKIPPER Kincaid! NO!  Kincaid fires.  We see Gilligan appear to get hit and fall or trip into a large trough marked "fresh water". We cut back to Kincaid who is obviously pleased with himself and starts over to the trough. The skipper and the professor arrive at the trough at the same time Kincaid does.  KINCAID Now to get my trophy!  Kincaid reaches into the trough to pull Gilligan out, but Gilligan is not dead. He grabs Kincaid's arm and pulls himself out of the trough at the same time Kincaid is pulled into the trough.  Gilligan gets out of the trough and runs full speed from the clearing.  SKIPPER Gilligan! Little buddy!  PROFESSOR Gilligan!  SKIPPER Keep going! Run!  PROFESSOR Run Gilligan!  SKIPPER Keep Going!  PROFESSOR Run!  Kincaid has pulled himself up from the trough and is now aiming at the fleeing Gilligan, all the while the Skipper and the Professor are encouraging him to run. Kincaid aims, and pulls the trigger. Instead of a ear splitting blast, just a jet of water shoots from the barrel.  FADE TO: EXT - CAVE - DAY  Ramoo is seen tied up with rope as Kincaid unties him.  RAMOO I'm sorry Ramoo not scare woman.  KINCAID You natives are too tender hearted.  RAMOO Yeah it's to bad.  Kincaid has finished untying Ramoo.  KINCAID Come on we'll pick up his trail again!  FLIP TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  The Skipper and Professor are in a clearing along with an odd tree. The professor is sweeping away foot prints that lead to the tree.  PROFESSOR I'll brush the foot prints away from Gilligan's roots.  SKIPPER Good idea.  PROFESSOR And I'll try to keep Kincaid away from this area. (pause) How you doing in there Gilligan?  GILLIGAN I'm so nervous my knot holes are shaking!  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) Little buddy we're gonna take off now.  The professor see someone coming up the path towards the clearing.  PROFESSOR (QUIETLY) Shhhhh…I think I hear somebody coming!  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) Quiet Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Huh!  The Skipper and Professor step away from the tree Gilligan is hiding in.  Kincaid and Ramoo walk into the clearing where he meets the skipper and professor.  SKIPPER Mr. Kincaid. (laughs)  KINCAID Well gentlemen, your friends trail ends right here and I have a feeling he's somewhere near by.  SKIPPER (innocently) Where?  KINCAID Ramoo, did you thoroughly clean my rifle?  RAMOO Ramoo think so.  KINCAID You think so huh?  Well maybe we better test it. Draw me a target  Ramoo has a piece of chalk and walks over to the tree that Gilligan is hiding in. He draws a poor bullseye on the tree.  PROFESSOR Your…your…your…your not going to shoot that tree are you!?  KINCAID Why not!  SKIPPER Well because eb…eb.eb trees are out of season!  Besides, what kind of target is a tree?  PROFESSOR Yes, I…I mean especially that one! Why that's a that's a Nakapoorasaka! According to the local natives it's a sacred tree, why if you even scratch it, it'll bring you twenty-five years of bad luck!  SKIPPER That's exactly right, honestly, it's worse luck than breaking three mirrors!  KINCAID That's nonsense now get out of my way!   Kincaid readies his rifle and starts to take aim through the scope. Gilligan inside the tree makes the tree revolve so that the bullseye is now no longer visible. Kincaid looks through the scope and doesn't see the bullseye.  KINCAID Can't you do anything right, I told you to draw me a target!  RAMOO Ramoo draw target! I do again.  KINCAID Ah no that's alright.  I'll just put a bullet right in the center of that tree.  SKIPPER Oop…oop Mr. Kincaid! Why waste your time shooting a tree? Why don't you shoot Gilligan!  KINCAID Shoot Gilligan stead of a tree.  PROFESSOR Yes that's…that's…that's one of our favorite trees!  KINCAID Ramoo, I think the tension is getting to be too much for them.  RAMOO Yes.  Once again Kincaid takes aim, this time he see the tree moving back and forth, around and around. He takes a moment to rub his eyes to clear the illusion.  KINCAID My malaria must be coming back.  He looks up to see the tree moving and then realizes…  KINCAID It's Gilligan!  He raises his rifle and is getting ready to shoot. The skipper can take no more. He pushes the rifle away to make Kincaid loose his aim.    SKIPPER Ep…ep…ep you shoot that gun it'll be murder!  Kincaid pulls the rifle away from the skipper and resumes his aim. Just as Kincaid starts to squeeze the trigger, his alarm on his watch goes off ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. The Skipper hears the alarm and pushes the rifle out of the way again.  SKIPPER The alarm! It's twenty-four hours!  PROFESSOR Gilligan is saved!  Kincaid lowers his rifle and looks disappointed.  KINCAID Well nobody can say that Jonathan Kincaid doesn't keep his word. Come on Ramoo let's go home.  SKIPPER Wa…wa.no wait a minute Mr. Kincaid, what about us!? You said you were going to radio for help!  KINCAID (SADISTIC LAUGH) Are you kidding!? If the authorities found out I was hunting a human being they'd put me in jail!  SKIPPER Bu…We won't tell anyone!  KINCAID Sorry chaps can't take that chance.  With that said, Kincaid and Ramoo turn and start to walk off. Ramoo pokes the skipper with his spear as he's about to leave. The Skipper, the Professor and Gilligan (still in the tree) have been left behind.  PROFESSOR Well, the main thing is that Gilligan is still alive!  SKIPPER Yes, my little buddy!  The Skipper and the professor walk back to the tree Gilligan is hiding in.  SKIPPER Gilligan little buddy, you can calm down now! The alarm went off, the twenty-four hours is over!  GILLIGAN Really!?  SKIPPER Really little buddy! You don't know how close you came to getting killed!  GILLIGAN Really!!  The skipper holds up his hand and puts his thumb and index figures together with only a small space between.  SKIPPER That close!  Gilligan then sticks his hand out through the viewing slot and makes the same gesture.  GILLIGAN That close!?  SKIPPER That's right!  Gilligan pulls his hand back into the tree and with the sound of a tree falling, the tree topples over as Gilligan faints inside. And as the tree falls the skipper yells…  SKIPPER Timber!  The tree falls on the skippers foot making him yelp with pain.  FADE OUT    EPILOG  FADE IN:  CUT TO: INT - GILLIGAN'S & SKIPPERS HUT - DAY  Gilligan, Mr. Howll, the Skipper and the Professor are listening to the radio as they sit at the table in the center of the hut.  RADIO ANNOUNCER …AND THE DODGERS SHUT OUT THE METS FOUR TO NOTHING.  MR HOWELL Ha.ha…that…that makes three hundred thousand and twelve bananas that you owe me!

Episode #23, “How to Be a Hero” Gilligan is envious of the accolades the Skipper receives when he saves Mary Ann from drowning. The castaways plot to make Gilligan a fake hero, but when a headhunter takes the other castaways prisoner, Gilligan becomes a real hero.  “How to Be a Hero”  By  Herbert Finn  and  Alan Dinehart  March 6, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT.

Gilligan stands on the lagoon store and calls out to Mary Ann. GILLIGAN Hold on! I'll save you, Mary Ann! Gilligan dives into the water. He swims to Mary Ann. MARY ANN Help! Save me! Help! Help! Save me! Gilligan reaches Mary Ann. Mary Ann clings to Gilligan. GILLIGAN Here, Mary Ann. Mary Ann inadvertently pushes Gilligan down into the water. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Mary Ann! They both go under the water and pop back up. Mary Ann screams. Mary Ann pushes Gilligan down. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Help! Mary Ann pushes Gilligan under the water. SKIPPER appears out of the jungle and runs toward the water. BACK TO SCENE They both bob out of the water. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Help! MARY ANN Help! Gilligan goes under the water. GILLIGAN Help! SKIPPER runs toward the water and throws himself into the lagoon. SKIPPER Hang on! Skipper makes a big splash. GILLIGAN That's what I say, "Help, help"! Skipper swims to them. Mary Ann puts her arm around Skipper. SKIPPER Calm down, Mary Ann! EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Headhunter watches them from the shore. EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY SKIPPER (O.S.) Come here, Gilligan! EXT. LAGOON Skipper slowly walks out of the lagoon, holding Gilligan under one arm and Mary Ann under the other. Gilligan coughs. ZOOM TO Headhunter watches them from the jungle edge. FADE OUT. END TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. CAMP - DAY Mr. Howell points a single-lens reflex camera with flash bulbs at Skipper. Mrs. Howell stands nearby. Skipper poses with his arms folded across his chest. Mary Ann sits on the dining table. Gilligan stands next to the dining table on the side opposite side from Mary Ann. MR HOWELL Now, when I get this picture, I'm going to put it on the front page of every newspaper in my chain, with the caption: "Heroic rescue at sea." There we are, Skipper. Hold it! Mr. Howell takes the shot and the FLASH BULB POPS. He ejects the flash bulb. Mrs. Howell walks over to Skipper, holding a piece of paper roughly the size of a check. MRS HOWELL Now take one of me presenting our hero with a check. It goes with the Howell medal for bravery. SKIPPER The Howell medal for bravery? MARY ANN You deserve it, Skipper. Gilligan looks like he's uncomfortable with all the attention lavished on Skipper. MR HOWELL I've been saving this film for such a suitable occasion. Mr. Howell raises the camera to take another picture. MR HOWELL (cont'd) There you are, Lovey, smile. Mrs. Howell mugs for Mr. Howell's camera. The FLASH BULB POPS. Skipper blinks his eyes as if he were seeing spots. MR HOWELL (cont'd) There we are. Mr. Howell tosses the spent flashbulb aside. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Now let's get one with Mary Ann. Mr. Howell nudges Skipper toward the dining table where Mary Ann sits. SKIPPER Another picture, Mister Howell? Mr. Howell replaces the flash bulb. MR HOWELL We newshawks get our nose in a story, let me tell you something, we're insatiable. Skipper sits down next to Mary Ann. Mr. Howell lines up the camera shot. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Now, our hero and the little girl that he rescued. Mary Ann and Skipper pose for the picture MR HOWELL (cont'd) There we are. Mr. Howell shoos Gilligan out of his shot. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Gilligan, will you get out of the way, please? GILLIGAN Sure, Mister Howell. Gilligan walks away from the dining table. MR HOWELL Now, will you show a little knee, please? Skipper laughs uncomfortably and pulls his pant leg up. Mr. Howell lowers the camera. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Not you, Skipper. Mary Ann. Cheesecake. Mary Ann tugs on the hem of her skirt and raises it slightly above her knee. Mary Ann and Skipper snuggle closely. Mr. Howell takes the shot and the FLASH BULB POPS. Mr. Howell turns around to face the jungle. Gilligan sits on a large boulder. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Just what I like, a leafy background. Mr. Howell raises his camera, realizes Gilligan is in his shot, and shoos him. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Will you get out of there, my boy? Gilligan stands and walks to the side. Skipper and Mary Ann walk over to the boulder. Mr. Howell directs them to the boulder. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Nice pose there. Skipper sits on the boulder. Mary Ann sits on his lap. MRS HOWELL Isn't it exciting having a real hero on the island? GILLIGAN Yeah. Skipper looks at the camera. Mary Ann kisses Skipper lightly on the cheek. The FLASH BULB POPS. Skipper blinks as if he's seeing spots. Mary Ann smiles broadly. MRS HOWELL Skipper will go down in history like John Paul Jones or Horatio Hornblower or Henry van Rootbaum. GILLIGAN Henry van Rootbaum? MRS HOWELL Yes. The little Dutch boy who held his finger in the dike and saved a whole city. GILLIGAN He held his finger in a dike and saved a whole city? Which one? MRS HOWELL I'm not quite sure, but I think it was this one. Mrs. Howell raises her right hand and extends her pinky. Mr. Howell asks Skipper and Mary Ann to pose for another shot. MR HOWELL There you are, Skipper. Just one more. That's it. Hold it. Mary Ann stretches out and gives a big wave. The FLASH BULB POPS. Skipper blinks. Mary Ann puts her arms around Skipper, her hero. MRS HOWELL He's handsome, isn't he? GILLIGAN You know, I swam out to save Mary Ann. I dove in and swam as fast as I could -- MRS HOWELL Yes, Gilligan. GILLIGAN The water was real cold, but I jumped in, and I was swimming very hard. Professor and Ginger emerge from the jungle path. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hey, Professor, did you happen to see when I dove in the water -- to swim to Mary Ann? I swam very fa -- PROFESSOR No, I didn't, Gilligan. All I saw was the Skipper carrying you both out. GINGER You must be very proud to have such a brave skipper. GILLIGAN Yeah. Mr. Howell crouches to line up another camera shot. MR HOWELL No. Get closer together. That's it. I like that composition. Mrs. Howell sits next to Skipper. Mary Ann continues to sit on Skipper's lap. MR HOWELL (cont'd) It's gonna look so good in the paper. The FLASH BULB POPS. Skipper blinks. MR HOWELL (cont'd) There's only one picture left in this roll and I want it to be a good one. Where's Gilligan? GILLIGAN You want me, Mister Howell? You want me in the picture? Gilligan runs over to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL No, no, no. I want you to take it, because I want to be in it. Get in the picture, Ginger. Mr. Howell sits next to Mrs. Howell. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Ginger, you sit here, (slaps his knee) and, Professor, you in the back. Ginger sits on Mr. Howell's lap. Professor stands behind them. Mr. Howell puts his arm around Ginger. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Makes nice composition. Everyone look at the Skipper. Mrs. Howell glares at Mr. Howell. GILLIGAN Is everybody ready? Mrs. Howell continues glaring at Mr. Howell. He notices her glare and frowns back. Gilligan raises the camera to take the shot. The FLASH BULB POPS. Skipper blinks. MR HOWELL Oh, that was very, very good. Ginger gets up from Mr. Howell's lap. Mrs. Howell continues to look at Mr. Howell. Skipper shakes Mr. Howell's hand. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Yes, I'll see you on the front page -- SKIPPER Oh, thank you, Mister Howell. Skipper shakes Ginger's hand. SKIPPER (cont'd) Ginger. MR HOWELL You were marvelous, too. Gilligan finds no joy in Skipper heroism and walks away. DISSOLVE TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY MRS. HOWELL stands with pencil in one hand and notepad in the other. MRS HOWELL Now, I'm going to give you a list of words. I want you to say the first thing that comes to your mind when I say them. Mrs. Howell sits down. PULL BACK to reveal Gilligan laying on a chaise lounge chair. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Ready? Gilligan grunts in the affirmative. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Marshmallow. GILLIGAN Ouch. MRS HOWELL Sunset. GILLIGAN Ouch! MRS HOWELL Tree. GILLIGAN Ouch! MRS HOWELL Really, Gilligan. I can't psychoanalyze you if all you can say is "ouch." GILLIGAN I don't know, Missus Howell. Maybe it's because I'm sitting on this (pulls out flattened hat) and this. Gilligan pulls out a bird feather quill. Mrs. Howell rolls her eyes. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE PUTTING GREEN - DAY Mr. Howell puts as Mrs. Howell walks up carrying a parasol. Skipper holds a golf bag. Mr. Howell misses his put. MRS HOWELL Oh, there you are, Thurston. MR HOWELL Please, Lovey, not while I'm putting. MRS HOWELL I thought you'd want to hear about Gilligan. SKIPPER We do. What seems to be wrong with my little buddy? Mrs. Howell points at Skipper. MRS HOWELL You. SKIPPER Me? MRS HOWELL Yes, you. In his subconscious mind, he envies you. He wants to be like you. MR HOWELL Well, I must say that seems strange. SKIPPER What seems strange about it? MR HOWELL Well, I can -- I mean, envying me, but -- SKIPPER What's wrong with envying me? After all, I am a hero. MRS HOWELL That's really Gilligan's problem. You're a hero, and he's not. That makes him feel small and insignificant. It gives him a sense of inferiority. Oh, it's a very simple neurosis, somewhat like an inferiority complex. MR HOWELL Inferiority complex? Heavens! I hope it isn't catching. SKIPPER Missus Howell, what can we do to cure this? MRS HOWELL Well, uh, Gilligan needs recognition. Something for his ego, I mean. SKIPPER Oh, I see. He wants to be a hero, huh? Well, I know just the guy who can arrange it. MR HOWELL Who? SKIPPER That little old hero maker, me. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FALLEN TREE - DAY Skipper and Ginger walk from the jungle path to a sandy clearing. A large fallen tree sits on the sand. SKIPPER Just a little further, Ginger. They walk up to the fallen tree. SKIPPER (cont'd) Here we are. Now, what do you see? GINGER Well, it looks like a fallen log to me. SKIPPER Exactly, but it's the answer to Gilligan's problems. Gonna make a hero out of him. Watch. Skipper lies down on the sand and slips his legs under the tree so it looks like the tree fell on him. GINGER Be careful, Skipper. SKIPPER Oh, don't worry. I know exactly what I'm doing. Skipper covers the space between the tree and his legs with sand. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, here's the plan: I'm gonna be trapped under this tree, and Gilligan's gonna save me, get it? GINGER Oh, yeah. Well, what am I supposed to do? SKIPPER Well, I want you to run back and get Gilligan. Now, I'm trapped under here, and I'll lie here and moan and groan. Skipper lies back with his arm against his forehead and moans and groans. SKIPPER (cont'd) How does that sound? GINGER You gotta project a little more, from the diaphragm, like this. Ginger groans from her diaphragm. Skipper tries to emulate her. He presses on his diaphragm while he moans and groans. Skipper looks to Ginger. Ginger more strongly projects her moans from the diaphragm. Skipper mimics Ginger. SKIPPER How do you like that? GINGER Richard Burton's got nothing to worry about. You keep practicing. I'll go get Gilligan. Ginger turns and walks toward the jungle path. GINGER (cont'd) Help! Help! ANGLE FROM SKIPPER'S FEET Skipper practices his moans from the diaphragm. Behind him in the jungle, the headhunter appears. HEADHUNTER carries a large blade. INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Gilligan rests in his hammock. GINGER (O.S.) Gilligan, help! The Skipper needs you! Gilligan sits up. GILLIGAN Help! Somebody help the Skipper. Gilligan tumbles out of his bunk into the lower bunk, and then onto the ground. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann pedals the oil drum washing machine. MARY ANN What's the matter? GINGER It's nothing. It's just for Gilligan. GINGER (cont'd) Gilligan, help! The Skipper needs you! GILLIGAN Here I am. What's the matter? GINGER The most terrible thing has happened to the Skipper. A tree fell on him. You've got to save his life. GILLIGAN I've gotta save his life. Only one thing. Which way? GINGER Down the end of the path. GILLIGAN Okay. Follow me! Follow me! Gilligan runs into Mary Ann's clothesline, which is strung between the hut and a bamboo pole next to the washing machine. The clothesline stretches like bungee cords and recoils, tossing Gilligan to the ground at Ginger's feet. Gilligan rises to his knees. Gilligan puts his hand on his neck. Gilligan stands up. GILLIGAN (cont'd) (hoarsely) Maybe I better follow you. Ginger hikes her dress up, and runs under the clothesline. Still holding his neck, Gilligan follows her. Mary Ann continues to pedal the washing machine. EXT. FALLEN TREE - DAY Skipper moans and groans from the diaphragm. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY GILLIGAN Here I come, Skipper. EXT. FALLEN TREE - DAY ANGLE FROM SKIPPER'S FEET Headhunter crawls across the sand, raising the large blade. GILLIGAN (O.S.) Don't lose your head, Skipper! Headhunter hears Gilligan calling to him and retreats back into the jungle. NEW ANGLE GILLIGAN Here I am. Are you all right? SKIPPER Oh, thank heavens! Gilligan, you're the only one who can save me. GINGER Get that heavy log off him. You've got to do something. GILLIGAN I don't know. It's quite a problem. Gilligan sits on the fallen tree. Skipper groans in actual pain. Gilligan stands up. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Sorry, Skipper. SKIPPER Gilligan, I don't mean to tell you how to be a hero, but if I were you, I would think about Archimedes and his rule. GILLIGAN Of what and who? SKIPPER Archimedes. He's the man who said, "Give me a lever, and I will move the world." GILLIGAN Oh, yeah? Maybe we ought to get him. SKIPPER He's been dead for over a thousand years. GILLIGAN Yeah? Well, isn't it kind of late to be bringing him up? Skipper moans and groans. GINGER You've got to do something. Look, he's suffering, the poor Skipper. GILLIGAN I don't know quite what to do. Gilligan tries to lift the fallen tree by hand. SKIPPER It's -- Gilligan, if you were lying under here, and I was you, I'd look around and realize I could make some rope out of those vines, and then I'd put it around that tree and use it for leverage. GILLIGAN Skipper, I wish you wouldn't talk so much. It's very hard for me to think. Gilligan notices the tree behind him. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Oh, I know. I'll take this vine, make it into a rope then I could throw it there, and tie it on the bottom, and I'd get some leverage. SKIPPER Now you're getting somewhere. GILLIGAN You see, Skipper? Give me a little time, I can figure out things. SKIPPER Aren't I lucky to have a hero like Gilligan come to rescue me? GINGER Oh, yes, isn't it wonderful? He's one in a million, Skipper. Just one in a million. Mary Ann and Mrs. Howell emerge from the jungle path. MARY ANN Well, what's going on here? GINGER Oh! The Skipper's pinned under the log and Gilligan's going to get him out. MRS HOWELL Oh, isn't it exciting? We're actually going to see a real hero in action. MARY ANN Oh, Gilligan, you're wonderful. MRS HOWELL This calls for a celebration. Let's go back to my hut and celebrate. Mrs. Howell turns toward the jungle path. Gilligan wraps the vine over the tree branch. SKIPPER Wait a minute, Missus Howell! I don't want to be a party pooper, but our hero hasn't done anything yet. Gilligan straddles the fallen tree. He lines up the vines to act as a pulley system. MRS HOWELL Oh, yes. Well, go ahead and do something. Don't just stand there. Save the man's life. GILLIGAN Yes, ma'am. Straddling the fallen tree, Gilligan sits on it and pulls on the vines. Skipper SKIPPER Gilligan! Gilligan barely stands, the vines move, and the fallen tree lifts up and falls back down on the Skipper's legs. Skipper cries out in pain. Gilligan moves to Skipper's side of the fallen tree. He pulls on the vine and the tree rises! The women watch in eager anticipation. Gilligan struggles, but manages to pull on the vines enough to lift the fallen tree a bit more. GILLIGAN Okay. Skipper, get ready now. Pull your legs out. Gilligan slips and his legs slide under the tree. He releases the vine and the fallen tree pins both of their legs under it. The women exclaim in horror. ANGLE ON SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN FROM THEIR FEET SKIPPER Nice going, Gilligan. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Skipper. They're not making vines like they used to. BACK TO SCENE MARY ANN What are we gonna do now? MRS HOWELL Let's get the Professor. He'll know what to do. He's a professor. GINGER Ooh, right. Now, you boys stay right where you are. MARY ANN Oh, don't go away. We'll be right back. HEADHUNTER emerges from the jungle behind Skipper and Gilligan. He gets on his hands and knees. And carries his large blade. ANGLE FROM THEIR FEET as the headhunter crawls toward the Skipper and Gilligan. GILLIGAN Cheer up, Skipper. The Professor will be here in a minute. He'll figure out something. SKIPPER I hope so. I've got a terrible headache. I feel like my head is gonna split. GILLIGAN You got any aspirin? SKIPPER No, I haven't got any aspirin. The headhunter rolls back onto his knees and backswings to strike with his large blade. GILLIGAN Let's see. What else can you do for a headache? MRS HOWELL (O.S.) This way, Professor. On hearing Mrs. Howell, the headhunter retreats back into the jungle. Mrs. Howell, Professor, Ginger, and Mary Ann walk down the jungle path toward Skipper and Gilligan. MRS HOWELL There they are. We were all set to hail the conquering hero, and now look at them. PROFESSOR I see. All right, we'll have you out in a jiffy. Come on girls, give me a hand here. Professor, Ginger, and Mary Ann lift the fallen tree by using their arms and backs, not their legs. MRS HOWELL Go on, girls. Ready? One, two, three. They lift the fallen tree. While they hold it up, Gilligan and Skipper remove their legs from under it. SKIPPER Thanks a lot, Professor. MRS HOWELL I knew the Professor would know what to do. Come on. Now we can have our party. Mary Ann, Mrs. Howell, Professor, Ginger, and Skipper head up the jungle path. Gilligan trails behind. GILLIGAN All I needed was some help. GILLIGAN looks over at the jungle. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Maybe I should've asked that headhunter over there for a hand. HEADHUNTER stands at the edge of the jungle, looking at Gilligan. GILLIGAN does a double-take. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan runs away from the headhunter and up the jungle path. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Mrs. Howell stands next to Gilligan's bunk. Gilligan lies back in it. Mrs. Howell gently swings the hammock. GILLIGAN But I tell you I saw him, a great, big headhunter. MRS HOWELL Yes, yes, I know. GILLIGAN I know you don't believe me, but it's true. He had skulls tied around his waist, and a big spear, and on his side -- MRS HOWELL Here, now you drink this. Mrs. Howell holds Gilligan's head up so he can take a drink. She takes a coconut cup from the table and provides it to Gilligan. Mrs. Howell never releases the cup and Gilligan drinks from the cup. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) There. Gilligan releases the cup and Mrs. Howell gently puts Gilligan's head down on the hammock. She places the coconut cup back on the table. GILLIGAN And you should've seen his eyes, and his face was painted and -- What was that stuff you just gave me? MRS HOWELL Well, that will make you sleep. It was a sedative. GILLIGAN Thanks, but you're wasting your time. They don't work on me. Gilligan sits up. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I remember once -- Gilligan passes out and lies back on the hammock. Mrs. Howell folds Gilligan's arms across his chest and pats his hands. Mrs. Howell heads for the door. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mrs. Howell exits the boys hut. Outside, Skipper and Mr. Howell wait for her near the dining table. SKIPPER How is he? Mrs. Howell shushes Skipper. MRS HOWELL (sotto) He's sleeping now. I've given him a sedative. MR HOWELL (sotto) Imagine that. Now he's seeing headhunters. That boy is sicker than we thought. MRS HOWELL (sotto) You're right, Thurston. It wasn't so bad when he was having an inferiority complex -- but now he's having delusions. SKIPPER My poor little buddy. Why, I'm gonna have to make a hero out of him before he goes off his rocker. MR HOWELL (sotto) You make a hero out of him after you bungled the job this morning? This is a job that calls for tact, finesse, imagination -- MRS HOWELL Thurston, that sounds like you. MR HOWELL (sotto) You guessed it already, and I hadn't even gotten to "brilliant." Mr. Howell presses his index finger to his lips in a "be quiet" motion. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BOYS HUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Gilligan lies in his bunk. He's restless and tosses and turns. MRS HOWELL (O.S.) Help! Save me! Somebody save me! Gilligan stirs and wonders if he was dreaming. MRS HOWELL (O.S.) (cont'd) Help! Gilligan becomes fully awake. GILLIGAN That's Missus Howell. Gilligan climbs out of his bunk and heads for the door. EXT. CAMP - NIGHT Two coconut torches on poles burn on either side of the boys hut. Gilligan runs out of the boys hut, leaps onto and over the dining table toward the Howells hut. GILLIGAN I'm coming, Missus Howell! EXT. CAMP - NIGHT MR. HOWELL AND PROFESSOR watch from the door frame of another hut. They exchange gleeful glances. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - NIGHT Gilligan runs past. Mary Ann, Skipper, and Ginger pop up from the dense foliage. Ginger turns and looks at Skipper. INT./EXT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Mrs. Howell stands on a chaise lounge chair, calling for help. MRS HOWELL Save me! Save me! Somebody save me! Gilligan runs by the window and stops at the door. EXT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Gilligan knocks on the hut door. MRS HOWELL Help! Help! INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Mrs. Howell stands on a chaise lounge chair, calling for help. MRS HOWELL Help! Help! (calmly) Who is it? EXT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Gilligan stands politely at the Howell's door. GILLIGAN It's me, Gilligan. MRS HOWELL (politely) Do come in. Gilligan scrambles to open the door and go in. INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Mrs. Howell stands on a chaise lounge chair. MRS HOWELL My hero. Gilligan runs over to Mrs. Howell. GILLIGAN Missus Howell, what's the matter? What is it? Mrs. Howell points to a spider on the ground. MRS HOWELL A tarantula. Save me. Gilligan looks at the spider. GILLIGAN Missus Howell, that's not a tarantula. It's a plain old beach spider. Gilligan bends over to pick it up. MRS HOWELL (faux panicked) Don't argue! Save me! Mrs. Howell glances sideways at Gilligan. GILLIGAN Be calm, Missus Howell. I'll take care of him. Gilligan looks around the Howells hut for something to handle the spider. He sees a broom and walks over to it. Gilligan picks up the broom and brings it to the spider. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Missus Howell, maybe you'd better not look, huh? MRS. HOWELL hides behind a fan, but watches Gilligan over the top edge of it. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan lines up to hit the spider with the broom. He swings back in a practice swing to ensure his shot is lined up and extends the broom to the spider's position. Gilligan swings the broom back and hits his own head against the bamboo support pole in the middle of the room, knocking himself out. Gilligan drops the broom and slumps down to the base of the pole. Gilligan closes his eyes and drops his head. MRS. HOWELL shakes her head in disbelief. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann and Skipper sit at the dining table and brainstorm ideas to make Gilligan appear to be a hero. MARY ANN I've got it. I know how to make a hero out of Gilligan. SKIPPER How? MARY ANN See that cliff over there? Mary Ann points. MOUNTAINOUS ISLAND BACK TO SCENE MARY ANN (cont'd) You climb to the top and pretend you've broken your leg. SKIPPER Yeah? MARY ANN Then you yell for help. SKIPPER Yes? MARY ANN Well, Gilligan climbs to the top and he carries you down. And that way that -- Mrs. Howell approaches from the jungle. SKIPPER Wait a minute, Mary Ann. Gilligan climbs to the top of the cliff and carries me down then I would have a broken leg and a broken neck. Mrs. Howell stands behind Mary Ann. SKIPPER (cont'd) Hello, Missus Howell. Mary Ann just had a beautiful idea on how to help poor Gilligan -- only I have to die in the end. MRS HOWELL Aww, I'm afraid it's hopeless. After all, you know what they say: You can't make a hero out of a sow's ear. Skipper shushes her. From around the edge of the hut, Gilligan appears and walks toward them. MARY ANN We've gotta help him. We just can't give up. SKIPPER Exactly. We've got to find a way to help poor Gilligan. Gilligan interrupts their conversation. GILLIGAN Did I hear somebody say "Gilligan"? Mrs. Howell, Mary Ann, and Skipper are surprised to see Gilligan. Skipper stammers his answer. SKIPPER No, uh, wh -- not exactly. I -- I just said, "It's rained before, and it will again." GILLIGAN Oh. SKIPPER Gilligan, will you do me a favor? Gilligan nods. SKIPPER (cont'd) Would you go pick some bananas? GILLIGAN What if I meet that headhunter? SKIPPER Will you stop bringing that up? How many times have I told you? There are no headhunters on these islands. There haven't been for three hundred years. MRS HOWELL Gilligan, I thought I convinced you that that headhunter was a figment of your imagination -- an optical illusion. GILLIGAN Yeah, I guess I was just seeing things. Gilligan turns and walks toward the hut, where he picks up a woven basket appropriate for carrying bananas. Gilligan walks toward the jungle. MRS HOWELL I'm afraid Sigmund Freud wouldn't touch that boy with a ten-foot couch. Gilligan stops walking, turns around, and walks back to the dining table. GILLIGAN Hey, Skipper? SKIPPER What is it? GILLIGAN Should I pick the yellow or the red bananas? Because the yellow bananas are green. SKIPPER Then pick the red ones. GILLIGAN But the red ones are pink. SKIPPER I don't care if you pick red, white, and blue bananas. Just pick some bananas! GILLIGAN Okay. Skipper. Blue bananas? Gilligan turns and walks toward the jungle. SKIPPER Gilligan just gave me a great idea. MARY ANN What? SKIPPER Well, let's not talk here. Let's go somewhere where we can be in private. Come on. They get up from the dining table. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Skipper leads Mrs. Howell and Mary Ann through the jungle. They stop by a large plant. MRS HOWELL Are we going to discuss Gilligan's problems or are we going on safari? SKIPPER I had to find a place where we could talk without being overheard. Now here's my idea. We've got to make Gilligan do something heroic, right? MARY ANN Right. SKIPPER And he ought to do it in front of everyone. Mrs. Howell nods. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, Gilligan's got headhunters on the brain. Let's let him see a real headhunter. MARY ANN Missus Howell, I think you have another customer for your couch. SKIPPER Oh, you don't understand, Mary Ann. I'll dress up as a headhunter. I'll take you all prisoners, and Gilligan can come to your rescue. MRS HOWELL It just might work. MARY ANN Can you stage it without Gilligan finding out? SKIPPER Don't you worry. He'll never find out. Skipper picks a banana from the large plant. The trio exit. PUSH IN to reveal from the middle of the large plant, Gilligan emerges holding a large bunch of bananas. He shakes his head and sighs. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY Ginger and Mary Ann carry four bamboo poles through the jungle. GINGER I don't know. In my opinion, it's a silly idea for the Skipper to dress as a headhunter. MARY ANN Oh, maybe I didn't explain it right. Oh, there's the Skipper now, Ginger. Why don't you ask him? The women stop next to the headhunter. GINGER Skipper, I was just telling Mary Ann I think it's a silly idea for you to dress up like a headhunter. In the first place -- Headhunter grunts unintelligibly. SKIPPER Mary Ann, that's not the Skipper. Headhunter moves toward them. They drop the BAMBOO POLES which make a LOUD NOISE. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Professor sits on the sandy ground while leaning back on a boulder. He reads a book. Having heard the noise, Professor closes his book, gets up, dusts himself off, and walks further into the jungle to investigate. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell walk through the jungle. MR HOWELL Lovey, why does he have all the fun? I mean, why can't I be the headhunter? MRS HOWELL Well, after all, dear, it was his idea. You can be the headhunter next time. MR HOWELL All right. They hear MUTED AND GAGGED VOICES. MRS HOWELL Look at that. Mrs. Howell points to EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Ginger, Mary Ann, and Professor stand gagged and tied to upright bamboo poles. Behind their gags, they call for help. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell think the scene is staged by Skipper. MR HOWELL That is rather overdoing it, isn't it? Mrs. Howell laughs. The headhunter appears behind them. Mrs. Howell pokes Mr. Howell to draw his attention to the headhunter. MRS HOWELL What a getup. Mr. Howell turns to the headhunter. MR HOWELL Oh, Captain, you bungled again. If you want to look like a headhunter, those feathers are ridiculous. You look like a showgirl. Headhunter growls and lunges for the Howells. MATCH CUT TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper, dressed as a headhunter, practices in front of a mirror. He growls into the mirror and is proud of his performance. He breaks the fourth wall. SKIPPER/HEADHUNTER Not bad, if I say so myself. EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan emerges from the jungle and heads toward the boys hut. GILLIGAN Skipper, I came to tell you something. INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper/headhunter panics. SKIPPER/HEADHUNTER Gosh. I can't let Gilligan see me like this. Skipper/headhunter looks for a place to hide. He sees a window and decides to crawl out of it. INT./EXT. BOYS HUT/CAMP Gilligan approaches the boys hut from the outside. GILLIGAN I overheard you talking how you're gonna make me a hero, but it won't work. So you don't have to get all dressed up like a headhunter and -- Gilligan opens the door and looks for Skipper. SKIPPER Skipper? Skipper? FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan walks down the jungle path. EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Professor, Mary Ann, and Ginger are all gagged and bound to bamboo poles. Headhunter binds Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell to other bamboo poles. A small campfire burns within the clearing. MRS HOWELL Oh, really, Thurston, what nerve. Why don't you give him a piece of your mind? MR HOWELL Well -- MRS HOWELL Well, go on, dear. He can't eat you. MR HOWELL Are you sure? Headhunter tends to the fire. Satisfied, he grunts, picks up his spear, and stands up. He quickly walks out of the clearing into the jungle. Gilligan appears from the jungle into the clearing. He sees everyone tied up. The gagged castaways try to speak to him. GILLIGAN Hi, Missus Howell. Hi, Mister Howell. MRS HOWELL Gilligan, save us, save us! You've got to save our lives. MR HOWELL Gilligan, save us from the headhunter. GILLIGAN (incredulous) Save you from the headhunter, huh? MR HOWELL Yes. He's gonna kill us. GILLIGAN (incredulous) Oh, yeah? Well, don't worry about it, Mister Howell. It's like Missus Howell says. He's just a figment of my imagination. Headhunter appears from the jungle behind Gilligan. MR HOWELL Missus Howell is wrong. The headhunter's for real. GILLIGAN Oh, if there's a headhunter around here, I'd like to meet him. MR HOWELL Mister Headhunter, meet Mister Gilligan. Mister Gilligan, meet Mister Headhunter. Gilligan turns around to see headhunter. He acts surprised by dropping his jaw. GILLIGAN What do you know, it is a headhunter! (winks) Hiya, Skipper. Headhunter grunts. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Ooh -- That sounds pretty convincing. You want me to be a hero, huh? Well, take this. Gilligan walks up to headhunter, grabs his nose, and twists it. This infuriates headhunter, who growls at Gilligan, raises his spear, and charges at him. Gilligan easily dodges the spear. "Proud" of himself, Gilligan preens to Ginger and turns his back to headhunter. Having missed Gilligan, headhunter turns toward Gilligan, growls, points the spear at Gilligan, and charges him, thrusting the spear into Gilligan. Gilligan arches his back. It looks like Headhunter gored Gilligan with the spear! MR HOWELL Oh! MRS HOWELL Eek! Gilligan groans and moans. Headhunter looks at Gilligan as if he's never witnessed an overacted death scene. Gilligan pants and turns around for face headhunter. Gilligan raises his left arm to show that the spear was, in fact, under his arm and that it was a ruse. Gilligan points the spear at headhunter. That enrages headhunter and he pulls the large blade from his belt and charges at Gilligan. Headhunter swings the blade and chops off the end of the spear. Gilligan looks at the remains of the spear and places it vertically in the sand. Gilligan walks casually over to the camp fire. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Ooh -- I can't look. Who's winning now? MR HOWELL Well, Gilligan's doing all right, but I've got to bet on the headhunter. Gilligan drops the remains of the spear on the campfire. GILLIGAN Here's some more wood for your fire. Headhunter swings the large blade at Gilligan. Gilligan ducks and the headhunter misses. Headhunter swings his large blade toward Gilligan's knees and Gilligan jumps over his blade. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Ice cream soda. Headhunter swings the large blade at Gilligan's head. Gilligan ducks. Headhunter swings his large blade toward Gilligan's knees and Gilligan jumps over his blade. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Ice-cold punch. Headhunter swings the large blade at Gilligan's knees. Gilligan jumps over his blade. Headhunter swings his large blade toward Gilligan's knees and Gilligan jumps over his blade. GILLIGAN (cont'd) That's the name of your honeybunch. Headhunter growls at Gilligan. Gilligan runs to a small tree at the edge of the clearing and rests against it, taunting headhunter. Headhunter catches up with him, and swings the large blade which sticks in the bark of the tree. Headhunter grunts and struggles to remove the large blade from the tree. Gilligan raises his hand to stop headhunter. Headhunter releases the large blade handle. Gilligan grabs the handle of the large blade and works it back and forth to release it from the tree bark. GILLIGAN (cont'd) You know, if they ever give out Oscars for headhunters you're a cinch to get one. Gilligan hands the large blade to headhunter. Headhunter growls angrily. Gilligan hides behind the small tree. HEADHUNTER scowls at Gilligan. GILLIGAN taunts headhunter. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Okay, Skipper, make her good. Headhunter growls loudly at Gilligan, swings back, and strikes the large blade into the fork of the tree. The tree splits completely in half, down to the root. Headhunter's large blade sticks in the tree. Gilligan uses his opportunity to toy with headhunter some more. Gilligan claps and runs from the small tree past headhunter. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Make way! In and out the window! Follow me! Headhunter works his blade free and chases after Gilligan. Gilligan runs in a serpentine pattern around the other five castaways bound at the bamboo poles. Headhunter follows him. Gilligan runs between Ginger and Mary Ann and then between Mary Ann and Professor. He runs completely around Professor and then between Professor and Mrs. Howell. He runs from Mrs. Howell to Mr. Howell and completely runs around Mr. Howell. Gilligan makes a second lap around Mr. Howell, but headhunter runs between Professor and Mary Ann. Gilligan follows him. When headhunter realizes Gilligan is behind him, he turns around. As does Gilligan. Gilligan runs to the other side of the clearing. Headhunter chases closely behind. Gilligan nearly slips and falls on the sand, but he rights himself. Headhunter runs directly into a palm tree at the edge of the clearing and knocks it over. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper, look out for the tree -- Skipper. Gilligan looks to see if headhunter is okay. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Are you all right, Skipper? Gilligan hears nothing from headhunter. He walks to the center of the clearing. MR HOWELL You won. GILLIGAN How am I doing, huh? MR HOWELL Great. Skipper/headhunter runs out of the jungle and growls at Gilligan. GILLIGAN Skipper, how'd you change your costume so fast? SKIPPER Huh? GILLIGAN I liked your other outfit better. SKIPPER/HEADHUNTER What other outfit? GILLIGAN That one. Gilligan points to the edge of the clearing. He sees: HEADHUNTER has recovered and has his large blade drawn. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan looks startled with the realization that he's been toying with a real headhunter. Gilligan flees the clearing. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Run, Skipper. Run, run, run, run! Headhunter positions himself opposite Skipper. Gilligan turns around and runs back to Skipper and headhunter. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper! I'll save you, Skipper! GILLIGAN (cont'd) I'll save you, Skipper! Gilligan runs toward headhunter. He trips on Skipper/headhunter's leg as he runs past and tumbles into headhunter. Gilligan momentum pushes headhunter back and he falls behind-first onto the campfire. HEADHUNTER bounces up and down on the campfire. BACK TO SCENE Headhunter gets up and the back of his skirt is burned. He flees the clearing into the jungle, smoke billowing from his behind. EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Headhunter emerges from the jungle and runs toward the lagoon with a trail of smoke behind him. REVERSE ANGLE Headhunter runs into the lagoon and cools his hind quarters in the water. He swims away. EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Having unbound the castaways, they congratulate Gilligan. SKIPPER/HEADHUNTER Little buddy, that's the bravest thing I ever saw anybody ever do! GILLIGAN Yeah, it was kind of brave, wasn't it? MARY ANN Gilligan, you were wonderful! GINGER That was wonderful. GILLIGAN But Skipper, promise me one thing. SKIPPER/HEADHUNTER Anything. What is it, little buddy? GILLIGAN If I ever try to do something like that again, please stop me. Gilligan walks away, stepping on Skipper/headhunter's foot. Skipper cries out in pain. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. CAMP - DAY GILLIGAN stands and speaks to the castaways. PULL BACK to reveal the other castaways sit at the dining table. Behind him, an American flag made from island bits and pieces is mounted on the outside of the boys hut. GILLIGAN And I sure am proud that I did something brave. Of course it's no surprise to me. I mean, heroes run in my family. I don't mean they run. I mean they -- Well, take my Uncle Ramsey for instance. He was in the first world war with the Lost Battalion. He was the guide. MR HOWELL rests his head on his upright arm. He glances at Skipper in a pleading way. GILLIGAN (cont'd) So, I guess being brave just kind of comes natural. SKIPPER winks at Mr. Howell. BACK TO SCENE Skipper rises from his seat and walks over to Gilligan. GILLIGAN (cont'd) And in conclusion, I would like to say -- Skipper taps Gilligan on the shoulder. Skipper holds one of the skulls from headhunter's belt. Gilligan turns and sees the skull. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Help! Gilligan falls backward to the ground. The castaways laugh. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY FADE OUT. THE END 
Episode #68, "Meet the Meteor" A huge meteor lands on the island turning everything old.      GILLIGAN’S ISLAND      "Meet the Meteor" by Elroy Schwartz   May 5, 1966     TEASER  FADE IN:  EXT – LAGOON – DAY – CREDIT OVERLAY  WIDE SHOT  Gilligan is seen running along the west pathway of the Lagoon’s edge occasionally looking up as he goes.  GILLIGAN Skipper! Hey Skipper!  CUT TO:  EXT – JUNGLE CLEARING NEAR HUT – DAY  Gilligan is seen running out from the jungle near the huts looking up as he runs.  GILLIGAN Skipper! Oh! Skipper!  PULL BACK WITH GILLIGAN TO SKIPPER – MEDIUM SHOT  The Skipper is laying on a lounge relaxing as Gilligan comes running from the jungle. As he frantically calls to the skipper, he doesn’t look where he’s going and abruptly runs into the Skipper knocking him off the lounge.  SKIPPER Ep! Gilligan is this your idea of some kind of a joke!  We hear a strange melodic sound coming from off screen as if something is descending.Gilligan points to the sky off screen as the Skipper looks up in the direction he’s pointing.  GILLIGAN Look a falling star!  CUT TO: FLAMING OBJECT DESCENDING FROM SKY (STOCK SHOT)  We see a bright flaming object as it descends through the sky with a strange melodic sound.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Gilligan it’s day time, that’s impossible!  CUT TO: FLAMING OBJECT DESCENDING FROM SKY (STOCK SHOT)  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Would you believe a falling moon?  SKIPPER (O.S.) No I wouldn’t believe a…  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  SKIPPER (CONTINUED) …falling moon!  GILLIGAN What would you believe?  The skipper and Gilligan react as they look up off screen at the object.  SKIPPER I…I believe it’s going to hit the island!  The Skipper and Gilligan follow the object with their eyes as it descends and react as we hear the explosion of the impact.  CUT TO: EXT – MOLTEN LAVA EJECTING FROM GROUND – DAY (STOCK SHOT)  We see a jet of bubbling molten lava over the crest of a low hill. There is the sound of the ground shaking.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN (CAMERA SHAKE)  The trembling of the ground is tossing the skipper and Gilligan around as the sound of the ground shaking continues to rumble.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Skipper!? What do you think it is!?  SKIPPER I don’t know Gilligan, but we better go see!  The skipper and Gilligan looking frightened, run off screen towards the fallen object.  WHIP PAN TO: EXT – METEOR IMPACT AREA – DAY  WIDE SHOT  We see half of a large spherical object imbedded in the ground with a ring of blackened raised dirt around the edge in the form of a crater. The object is dark in color but glowing an eerie red. There are wisps of smoke coming from the object as the Skipper and Gilligan arrive in the clearing and see the object.  SKIPPER Look Gilligan look!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN What a crazy care package.  SKIPPER It looks like something from outer space.  GILLIGAN I believe it! No wonder, after all the stuff we shot up there, they finally shot back!  SKIPPER No I don’t mean a weapon Gilligan, I mean it’s…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF METEOR  SKIPPER (O.S.) …it’s a piece of meteor.  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Oh no!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  GILLIGAN A piece meteor!? A meteor!!?  SKIPPER Yes a meteor!  GILLIGAN What’s a meteor?  SKIPPER (FRUSTRATED) Oh brother come on lets take a closer look.  The skipper and Gilligan slowly start to walk towards the meteor.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper I don’t think we should go to close it looks kind of spooky.  SKIPPER Gilligan let me explain. A piece of meteor is something off a star or a planet or something. And it breaks off every now and then and falls to Earth.  GILLIGAN Oh.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Don’t go near that!  Gilligan and the skipper react to the disembodied voice with alarm.  GILLIGAN It talked!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF METEOR  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Skipper! Gilligan!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan reacts in fear at the voice. The skipper looks off camera and sees the professor.  GILLIGAN It knows our names!  SKIPPER It’s the professor!  GILLIGAN Doesn’t look like the professor!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Get away from there!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan and skipper look off screen at the professor.  SKIPPER Wonder what he’s worried about.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Fast!!  GILLIGAN Let’s go find out, fast!  The skipper and Gilligan move quickly towards the professor.  PAN RIGHT WITH SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN TO PROFESSOR  SKIPPER What’s wrong professor?  PROFESSOR That large glowing object!  GILLIGAN It’s a meteor! It’s like a little piece of star or planet, breaks off and…  The skipper cuts Gilligan off in mid sentence.  SKIPPER All right Gilligan, the professor knows all about that.  Gilligan concedes.  GILLIGAN Oh.  PROFESSOR Now gentleman, on the one hand there may be nothing to worry about.  GILLIGAN (RELIEVED) Good.  PROFESSOR But on the other hand…  GILLIGAN I knew it! It’s always the other hand that gets into trouble!  SKIPPER Gilligan will you be quiet and let the professor talk!  PROFESSOR Now these meteors travel millions of miles through space. Through the Stratosphere, the Ionosphere, the radiation belt picking up all…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF METEOR  PROFESSOR (O.S.) …sorts of strange rays, that’s why it’s glowing!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  SKIPPER Oh my gosh! Wha…wha…what are we going to do about it!?  GILLIGAN I have a suggestion.  PROFESSOR Oh, what?  Gilligan runs off camera quickly.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT – (UNDERCRANKED)  Gilligan takes off running around and through the nearby area and then disappears into the jungle as we…  FADE OUT      ACT I  FADE IN:  EXT – SUPPLY HUT – DAY (STOCK FOOTAGE)  (Transcribers note: the stock shot is that of Ginger and Mary Ann’s hut)  CUT TO: INT – SUPPLY HUT – DAY  CLOSE UP OF GEIGER COUNTER  PULL BACK FOR MEDIUM SHOT  The professor and the skipper are working on some apparatus at the professor’s work table while Gilligan looks on.  PROFESSOR This simple form of Geiger counter will be able to tell us whether that meteor is radioactive.  SKIPPER Oh professor if it is, it’s absolutely deadly.  PROFESSOR Now just try to be calm. When we put this fallout meter together, we’ll make a radiation count. And that way we’ll definitely know whether there’s cause for alarm.  Gilligan starts making the sound of an alarm.  SKIPPER Gilligan!  GILLIGAN My alarm just went off.  SKIPPER Oh cut that out!  PROFESSOR Gilligan there is great need for secrecy. Ginger, Mary Ann and the Howell’s mustn’t know anything about this.  SKIPPER That’s a good idea professor. I’ll help you put this together, Gilligan…  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  SKIPPER I,I want you to stand guard outside the hut and let no body know what we’re doing.  GILLIGAN That’s easy ‘cause I don’t even know what we’re doing. (pause) By the way, what are we doing?  SKIPPER Gilligan, outside!  Gilligan reluctantly turns and starts to head outside the hut. The skipper and professor resume the construction of the Geiger counter.  PROFESSOR (TO SKIPPER) Here skipper, hold this.  The professor hands the Geiger counter to the skipper as Gilligan make his way outside.  CUT TO: EXT – SUPPLY HUT – DAY  MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is pacing back and forth in front of the supply hut as if on guard duty.  PAN CAMERA WITH GILLIGAN’S MOVEMENTS  Ginger walks on camera and up to Gilligan.  GINGER Gilligan what are you suppose to be?  GILLIGAN I can’t tell you.  GINGER What can’t you tell me?  GILLIGAN Ask me what the skipper and professor are doin’ in there.  GINGER All right. What are the skipper and professor doing in there?  GILLIGAN That’s what I can’t tell you.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  CUT TO: ANGLE FAVORING GINGER  Ginger puts on the charm and starts to run her fingers through Gilligan’s hair.  GINGER (SEDUCTIVELY) Gilligan come on.  CUT TO: ANGLE FAVORING GILLIGAN  GINGER (CONTINUED) You can tell Ginger.  GILLIGAN You might as well not run your fingers through my hair, you’ll probably end up with a palm of greasy kids stuff.  CUT TO: ANGLE FAVORING GINGER  GINGER Why can’t you tell me?  GILLIGAN My lips are sealed.  Ginger then gives Gilligan a passionate kiss.  GINGER There, did that steam them open?  CUT TO: ANGLE FAVORING GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN No. It’s a surprise.  GINGER A surprise?  Gilligan just stands there without saying a word but shakes head yes.  CUT TO: ANGLE FAVORING GINGER  GINGER My birthday. A surprise birthday party.  CUT TO: ANGLE FAVORING GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN A surprise birthday party?  CUT TO: ANGLE FAVORING GINGER  GINGER Oh you admitted it! Oh well gee I didn’t think anybody would have remembered. Oh, don’t tell anybody that I know.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  Ginger walks quickly off camera leaving Gilligan looking confused as usual.  GILLIGAN Ok.  Gilligan wipes the “kiss” from his mouth as he walks back to the supply huts door.  CUT TO: INT – SUPPLY HUT – DAY  MEDIUM SHOT OF DOORWAY  As Gilligan enters the hut we…  PULL BACK WITH GILLIGAN TO SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  The skipper and professor are still assembling the Geiger counter as Gilligan walks over to the professor and taps him on the shoulder. The professor is startled and the partially assembled Geiger counter falls apart.  PROFESSOR (TO GILLIGAN) Gilligan! Why did you do that?  GILLIGAN I just wanted to tell you something.  SKIPPER Gilligan will you please get out of here?  GILLIGAN Ginger wanted to know what was happening in here and I didn’t tell her, but she thinks she knows but she…  The skipper gets angry and cuts him off.  SKIPPER Gilligan! Gilligan OUT!  GILLIGAN Ok you don’t have to get sore about it.  Gilligan turns and starts out of the hut again. The Skipper and professor resume putting the Geiger counter back together. The professor nearly drops the Geiger counter on the ground but manages to catch it in time.  CUT TO: EXT – SUPPLY HUT – DAY  Mary Ann is seen with a laundry basket as she makes her way from around the side of the supply hut.  PAN LEFT WITH MARY ANN TO GILLIGAN  Gilligan’s back is to Mary Ann as she walks up behind him.  MARY ANN Hi Gilligan.  Gilligan gets startled and quickly turns around.  GILLIGAN Who goes there friend or foe?!  MARY ANN Well it’s me, Mary Ann.  GILLIGAN Mary Ann who?  MARY ANN Well how many Mary Ann’s do you know?  GILLIGAN Let me see I know, Mary Ann Thingelmeyer, Mary Ann Grumschmit, Mary Ann Dinglehoffer, Ma…  Mary Ann cut off Gilligan.  MARY ANN Oh Gilligan stop that. I’ve got to get into the supply hut and get some clothespins for the clothes.  Mary Ann starts to pass Gilligan as he stops here.  GILLIGAN Oh no, no you can’t go in there. Don’t you remember this is wear your dirty shirt week?  MARY ANN Oh! There’s something in there you don’t want me to see!  GILLIGAN Honest Mary Ann, I can’t tell anyone.  MARY ANN Uh-hu, if you can’t tell anyone it must be something for everybody.  Gilligan looks sick.  GILLIGAN Yeah it’s something for everybody all right.  MARY ANN A Christmas party! They’ve hidden the presents in there!  GILLIGAN They have!? Oh boy I! No wait a minute Mary Ann…  Mary Ann is obviously pleased with the idea of the Christmas party.  MARY ANN Oh Gilligan you just can’t keep a secret!  Mary Ann walks off camera quickly leaving Gilligan as confused as ever. He turns to go back in the supply hut.  CUT TO: INT – SUPPLY HUT –DAY  The skipper and professor are still engaged in constructing the Geiger counter as Gilligan comes into the hut. Gilligan walks up behind the professor but this time he doesn’t tap him on the shoulder.  GILLIGAN (LOUDLY) Hi!  The professor is startled into breaking the Geiger counter again. The professor gives Gilligan a stern look.  GILLIGAN I didn’t tap you on the shoulder this time.  SKIPPER Gilligan I have good idea for you. The next time that you have an urge to come in here, CONQUER it!!!  Gilligan reacts as if with hurt feelings.  SKIPPER OUT!  Gilligan turns and starts out the door once again. The professor and the skipper once again get back to work.  SKIPPER (DISAPPOINTEDLY) Oh, lets start again professor.  CUT TO: EXT – SUPPLY HUT JUNGLE – DAY  Mr. and Mrs. Howell are seen emerging from the jungle into the clearing near the supply hut.  PAN LEFT WITH MR. AND MRS. HOWELL TO GILLIGAN  MR. HOWELL Hello there Gilligan.  Gilligan stretches out his arms to stop the Howells from passing.  GILLIGAN HAULT! Back up and be recognized.  MRS HOWELL Recognized? Don’t be silly we’re mister and misses Howell you’ve met us dozens of times.  MR. HOWELL Stand aside young man we want to get our sun umbrella.  GILLIGAN I’m sorry no ones allowed in there.  Mr. Howell reacts with indignity.  MR. HOWELL I’ll have you know you’re speaking to a HOWELL!  GILLIGAN I’m sorry, Howell’s aren’t allowed in there either.  MRS. HOWELL Thurston I think I’m going to have one of my fainting spells!  MR. HOWELL No no no Lovey let me handle this.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  MR. HOWEL Young man I’ll have you know that the Howells are greeted with open arms at Buckingham Palace, the Whitehouse and the Kremlin. Which I must point out is easy to get into but murder to get out of.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I’m sorry no ones allowed in the supply hut.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  MRS. HOWELL Oh but I must get my parasol. This tropical sun plays havoc with delicate complexions.  MR. HOWELL You’re so right, and it isn’t good for your skin either.  GILLIGAN (O.S.) I’ll tell you this,…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN (CONTINUED) …the skipper and professor are working on a secret.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  MRS HOWELL (EXCITEDLY) Ah I just adore secrets. I love to hear them and I love to tell them.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Well I’d love to tell you but I can’t.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  MRS. HOWELL Oh well it doesn’t matter because I know anyway.  Mrs. Howell turns and whispers something in to Mr. Howells right ear which makes him smile.  MR. HOWELL Egad you’re so right Lovey!  He then turns and whispers something in to Mrs. Howell’s left ear which makes her smile.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is watching the Howells exchange whispers and is looking confused.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  MRS. HOWELL And besides that…  Mrs. Howell turns once again and whispers something in to Mr. Howells ear.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is still watching the Howells exchange whispers and is still just as confused.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF MR. AND MRS. HOWELL AND GILLIGAN  MR. HOWELL Yes which can only mean that…  Mr. Howell then whispers something into Mrs. Howell’s ear again who giggles. Mrs. Howell then in turn moves to Gilligan and whispers something in to his ear which makes him react with surprise.  GILLIGAN An anniversary party?  MR. HOWELL I’m going to break out my best bottle of bubbly!  MRS. HOWELL Oh it’s going to be marvelous! I know everyone will be there!  Ginger walks on camera and is stopped by Mrs. Howell.  MRS. HOWELL Oh darling…darling Ginger we have the most wonderful secret to tell you. It’s about the party.  Ginger reacts sternly.  GINGER Oh Gilligan you promised you weren’t going to tell anyone!  MR. HOWELL Well don’t worry about the expense of the gifts, after all it’s the spirit my dear that counts.  Ginger is confused.  GINGER Gifts!? Why should I bring a gift to my own birthday party?  Mr. Howell looks confused now.  MR. HOWELL Gilligan what is the meaning of this.  GILLIGAN I’m kind of confused myself.  Mary Ann has heard the quarrel and walks on camera.  MARY ANN Please stop fighting. We’re preparing for the Christmas party.  GINGER Christmas party?! You mean birthday party!  MRS. HOWELL Anniversary party!  MR. HOWELL Young man what have you got to say for yourself!?  GILLIGAN Just one thing.  MR. HOWELL What?  Just then, Gilligan walks off camera towards the supply hut.  CUT TO: INT – SUPPLY HUT – DAY  The skipper and professor nearly have the Geiger counter assembled when Gilligan enters the hut and yells…  GILLIGAN HEEEEEELP!  Startled, the professor drops the counter, the skipper hits the table and sends it crashing to the ground. The Geiger counter is once again destroyed. Both have a look of exasperation as we…  FADE TO: EXT – METEOR AREA – DAY  The professor and the skipper are seen walking out from the jungle area near the meteor. The professor is intently studying the readings from his Geiger counter as the travel. We can hear the faint clicks the Geiger counter is giving off indicating radiation. They stop near the meteor to take some readings.  SKIPPER Aren’t we close enough professor?  PROFESSOR Skipper you just right down the figures as I call them out.  The skipper has a note pad and pencil, ready to copy what the professor says.  SKIPPER Ok but talk fast.  PROFESSOR All right. Ten over sixteen. Nine over seventeen. Ten over eighteen.  The skipper and professor continue to slowly walk around the meteor taking readings as we…  FADE TO: EXT – SUPPLY HUT – DAY  MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR, SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  The professor is working on another project as Gilligan, armed with a bamboo shovel, digs in the dirt nearby. The skipper is holding a wooden bowl while Gilligan fills it with his shovel.  PROFESSOR So you see Gilligan there was no radiation near the meteor at all.   GILLIGAN (EXCITEDLY) OH BOY!  PROFESSOR However there were cosmic rays.  GILLIGAN (DEPRESSED) Oh boy.  PROFESSOR Which aren’t as deadly as interstellar radiation.  GILLIGAN (EXCITEDLY) OH BOY!  PROFESSOR However they can kill you.  GILLIGAN (DEPRESSED) Oh boy.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Gilligan, can’t you say anything but oh boy?  GILLIGAN I could say oh girl, but I don’t think it’d sound right.  SKIPPER Oh please. Keep digging! Now for goodness sakes, the professors got a way of using these cosmic rays that I think are going to get us off the island.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR  SKIPPER (O.S.) Right!?  PROFESSOR This reflective screen I’m making will focus those cosmic rays and shoot them straight up in to the air. A weather plane or radiation detection station is bound to spot them, investigate, and we’ll be rescued.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER (EXCITEDLY) OH BOY!  GILLIGAN Skipper!  SKIPPER Ep…Ep…well the skippers allowed.  GILLIGAN Still haven’t told me why I’m digging for lead?  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Why to protect ourselves from the cosmic rays when we put this screen around the meteor.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  SKIPPER That’s right you see, we’re gonna melt it all down, dip our clothes into it, and then they’ll be full of lead!  GILLIGAN How ‘bout that! Instead of getting the lead out, we’re getting the lead in!  SKIPPER (RESTRAINED) Yes Gilligan. DIG!  Gilligan goes back to digging as we…  (Transcribers note: This scene has been deleted since the early 70’s)  FLIP TO: EXT – SUPPLY HUT CLEARING – DAY  CLOSE UP OF A PAIR OF LARGE STIFF SILVER PANTS.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL THREE PAIRS OF STIFF SILVER PANTS ALL STANDING ALONE IN A ROW  END WITH WIDE SHOT OF SUPPLY HUT CLEARING  The skipper is using a bamboo pole to help support the bamboo screen the professor is coating with lead. At the far side of the clearing, Gilligan is coating a shirt with lead. There are two other lead coated shirts sitting on the ground near where he’s working. In the background there is a cast iron cauldron of silver material that’s being heated over a fire.  SKIPPER Hurry it up Gilligan, if this lead gets cold it won’t stick to the cloth!  GILLIGAN This is the last one!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR WITH GILLIGAN IN B.G.  PROFESSOR I’m going to need more of that lead.  SKIPPER Well there’s plenty over there professor.  GILLIGAN These things will really hold a press.  PROFESSOR Now let the rest of it cool. We may need it later.  Gilligan is still trying to lift a lead coated shirt with a bamboo pole.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper give me a hand with this it’s awful heavy.  SKIPPER All right. You got this professor?  The professor uses his free hand to support the screen while the skipper heads over to Gilligan’s position. He gets a bamboo pole to help Gilligan move the shirt. Both the skipper and Gilligan use their poles to lift a stiff lead coated shirt to where the others are located.  SKIPPER (STRAINED) Let’s put it over there with the other things.  GILLIGAN (STRAINED) Ok.  They move the shirt but it falls over with a plop and never bends or creases. The professor finishes the screen and moves over to where the skipper and Gilligan are.  PROFESSOR We’ve gotta start getting in to our things. Shoes first.  SKIPPER Yeah shoes first.  The skipper and the professor head over to where their shoes are laying while Gilligan eyes the pants standing erect all in a row.  PAN WITH GILLIGAN TO ROW OF PANTS  As the skipper and professor busy themselves with their shoes, Gilligan tries to figure out how to put the stiff lead coated pants on.  ZOOM IN FOR MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN  He finally decides to lay down his pair of pants and slides into them. He can only wiggle his feet but is unable to move as the skipper and professor walk over to where he’s laying.  SKIPPER Gilligan how’d you get your pants on?  GILLIGAN Stand me up and I’ll tell you.  The professor and skipper each grab one of Gilligan’s arms and raise him into position.  PAN UP WITH GILLIGAN FROM GROUND  Gilligan looks relieved that he’s finally standing again. He wobbles a bit but is steady.  ZOOM IN FOR MEDIUM SHOT OF ALL THREE  GILLIGAN Wooo you fall down you break your pants!  SKIPPER Well yeah be careful too you might break your neck.  GILLIGAN Professor, how ya gonna walk in these things.  PROFESSOR Well lead is a soft metal. It’ll loosen up as you move around a bit.  GILLIGAN Yeah.  PROFESSOR By the way, how DID you get into them?

Their hats, shoes, gloves and even sun glasses have all been coated with lead making them all look like the tin man from the Wizard of Oz. The professor, leading the group, is holding his Geiger counter while the skipper is carrying the lead covered rolled up bamboo screen. They stop.  PROFESSOR I’m afraid it’s rather difficult to walk.  SKIPPER This lead make-up sure feels funny professor.  PROFESSOR Well we need it to protect our faces from the cosmic rays.  GILLIGAN I feel like Frankenstein.  Gilligan stretches out his arms and starts to make a roaring sound. The skipper stops and makes the same sound towards Gilligan and scares Gilligan who starts to turn to run.  GILLIGAN Whaaaa!  SKIPPER Come back here Gilligan! (PAUSE) Cut that out!  PROFESSOR We’d better move on. We’re almost there.   SKIPPER Oh I hope so, these suits are sure uncomfortable.  GILLIGAN But I bet they wear like iron!  SKIPPER (STERNLY) Come on Gilligan.  They continue to move off through the jungle and off camera.  FLIP TO: EXT – METEOR AREA – DAY  MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP  The bamboo screen has been put in place around the meteor and the professor is taking readings on the Geiger counter.  PROFESSOR That’s wonderful! It’s wonderful! The count has drop almost to zero!  GILLIGAN You mean it might work!?  ZOOM IN FOR CLOSE UP OF GROUP  PROFESSOR I think so!  GILLIGAN I better go tell the others!  Gilligan starts to run past the meteor but is tripped by a small bush nearby. He falls flat on his face. The skipper and professor moves near by to help.  PAN RIGHT WITH GILLIGAN TO FALL  SKIPPER Gilligan!  PROFESSOR Skipper!	Give me a hand.  The professor and the skipper help Gilligan up from the ground.  PAN UP WITH GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Ep! Gilligan UP!  The skipper and professor are getting Gilligan to his feet when we…  FLIP TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  The professor, the skipper and Gilligan, having successfully put the screen around the meteor, are making their way back to camp through the jungle. Suddenly there is a strange sound of crunching wood coming from behind them.  PROFESSOR Wait! Wait! Wait! There’s something funny going on back there!  SKIPPER (NERVIOUSLY) Oh well we could use some laughs professor lets go back.  PROFESSOR No no no I don’t mean funny funny, I mean funny strange. Come on!  The group turns around and starts heading back towards the meteor and off camera.  FLIP TO: EXT – METEOR AREA – DAY  WIDE SHOT OF METEOR  We see that the bamboo screen is no longer visible. Instead, there is just a ring of saw dust in its place.  PULL BACK FOR MEDIUM SHOT  The professor, skipper and Gilligan walk on camera as they inspect the meteor.  SKIPPER Professor!? What happened to the bamboo screen?  PROFESSOR Why I’m afraid to even guess!  Gilligan looks up and to his left.  GILLIGAN I just noticed something.  Gilligan walks over to a large tree that’s near the meteor.  GILLIGAN Look at this tree!  The skipper and professor walk over to where Gilligan is and look at the tree.  SKIPPER Gilligan it’s just a tree!  ZOOM IN FOR CLOSE UP OF GROUP  GILLIGAN Yeah but a few minutes ago it was only four feet tall!  SKIPPER What do you mean a few minutes ago it was only four feet tall? Gilligan for goodness sakes…  The professor examines the tree and cut the skipper off in mid sentence.  PROFESSOR No no no skipper he’s right! I remember that tree, he tripped over it!  SKIPPER This is the tree that he tripped… Oh well professor what does it mean!?  PROFESSOR Well it means we gotta get rid of that meteor before it get rid of us!  GILLIGAN Gets rid of us?  PROFESSOR Gilligan, those cosmic rays are so powerful that they aged that bamboo screen into saw dust in just a few minutes.  SKIPPER Oh…Ep… and that tree!?  PROFESSOR A little while ago that tree was a sapling. It’s now fully grown and will die of old age within the week!  SKIPPER You mean to say that the cosmic rays of this meteor puts out, makes things grow older!?  PROFESSOR Yes they speed up the life process at an incredible rate.  GILLIGAN You’ve made me feel older since you been talking.  SKIPPER Wa…wa…wa…wa…what about the plants, the trees and the bamboo?  GILLIGAN An...an...an...and the people.  PROFESSOR Ah, I’m afraid that within a week, we shall all die of old age. However the others don’t know about this so lets not tell them.  GILLIGAN I have only one thing to say.  PROFESSOR What’s that?  GILLIGAN Why’d you have to tell me? Why? Why’d you have to tell me? WHY! WHY’D you have to tell me!? Why’d you have to tell me!?  SKIPPER All right Gilligan!  The skipper hits Gilligan with is lead covered hat which makes the sound of a metallic thump when it hits Gilligan’s head. The skipper shows surprise as Gilligan looks stunned.

The skipper looks at the professor in anticipation.  SKIPPER Are you thinking faster?  PROFESSOR Skipper I am thinking as fast as I can.  SKIPPER (ANGRY) Well it’s not fast enough!  PROFESSOR You know I know a way I could think faster.  SKIPPER (HOPEFULL) How!  PROFESSOR (STERNLY) If you’d stop telling me to think faster!  Gilligan walks into the hut with the radio and it’s playing music.  SKIPPER Gilligan this is no time to be listening to the radio. Now turn that music off.  GILLIGAN Why!? After next week, we won’t have time to listen to anything!  Just as Gilligan is about to turn off the radio, a weather report comes over the radio.  RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

PAN CAMERA TO FOLLOW MOVEMENT  PROFESSOR All right now listen skipper. Meteorites are composed of metals. They’re made of metals, iron compounds.  The professor stops by the hammock.

But all we have to work with is this lead.  Gilligan walks on camera with a long skinny bamboo pole.  GILLIGAN This is the straightest, longest bamboo pole I could find professor.  PROFESSOR Well that’s just fine Gilligan. Now put one end in this pot and keep turning. The lead will gradually harden on the pole.  GILLIGAN Huh.

By the end of the week we’ll be fifty years older. Soon we’ll all be fifty years older.  Gilligan is restless as he hears the professor’s words in his dream.  GILLIGAN (GROGGILY) Fifty years older. Fifty years older. Fifty years…  As Gilligan repeats the professor’s words, we start to fade into his dream.  FADE TO: INT – SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN’S HUT – NIGHT  MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN WITH SKIPPER IN BG  Gilligan is combing his hair as he hums to himself.

SKIPPER (OLD) Well hurry it up!  GILLIGAN (OLD) I’m runnin!  Gilligan grabs the skippers hand and the both of them make every labored effort to get the skipper out of the hammock with grunts and groans. We see the skipper is much older now too. He’s got long white hair and a beard.  SKIPPER (OLD) (labored and groaning more) Gilligan. Thanks little buddy! Hea…hea…hea… (PAUSE) Well it’s hard to realize, this, fiftieth anniversary on this island.  GILLIGAN (OLD) Fifty years! One good thing about it, we know everybody at the party!  Gilligan lets out a laugh that sound more like a dog coughing than a laugh. The skipper slaps him on the back making him nearly fall as he looses his breath making him gasp.  SKIPPER (OLD) Well hand me my cane Gilligan.  Gilligan goes over to the hammock pole where the cane is propped up and tries to pick it. It immediately drops to the ground pulling Gilligan with it as if it weighed a hundred pounds.  GILLIGAN (OLD) Either that canes getting heavier or I’m getting older!  SKIPPER (OLD) Well naturally Gilligan you’re getting older so the cane IS getting heavier.  Gilligan hands the cane to the skipper. The skipper gives the camera a long stare as if to say “for Pete’s sake!”  SKIPPER (OLD) Thank you. (PAUSE) Shall we start going?  The skipper and Gilligan slowly make their way towards the huts door and out.  FLIP TO: INT – MR. AND MRS. HOWELL’S HUT – NIGHT  CLOSE UP SHOT OF MR. AND MRS.

HOWELL (OLD) Oh nonsense Thurston, diamonds are never too heavy. Put it on me please.  Mr. Howell places it around Mrs. Howell’s neck and clasps the back. As he does, the weight of the necklace makes Mrs. Howell hunch over even more.  MR. HOWELL (OLD) There you are, I put it on you my dear. Oh it must be terribly uncomfortable.  MRS. HOWELL (OLD) Oh, on the contrary. It’s a delightful way to get the bends.  Mrs. Howell stands up and is still hunched over, part from age and part from the weight of the diamond.  MRS. HOWELL (OLD) Come along dear.  Mr. Howell turns to walk with Mrs. Howell to the door and he’s hunched over as well. He hops a bit and is more hunched over than before.  MR. HOWELL (OLD) To tell the truth I feel, more comfortable that way myself. Let me get my little hattie, and away we go! Ah! Out on the town!  MRS. HOWELL (OLD) You're so gallant.

BINGO Well I'll tell you what we'll do commodore. If your group will cooperate with the Mosquitoes, we'll get you off the island.  MR HOWELL Good heavens!  If we had to be rescued by musicians, why couldn't it have been the New York Philharmonic!?  Really your trousers!  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  STOCK SHOT OF HUT  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - DAY  The Mosquitoes are all in the hut along with their instruments.  One is playing the guitar while Bingo is using this drumsticks to tape out a beat on his thigh. The professor looks on with interest as Gilligan is obviously thrilled that the Mosquitoes are on the island.  PROFESSOR So that's what's happened to our civilization since we've been gone.  GILLIGAN Yeah they're the Mosquitoes, I've got a collection of all their albums!  BINGO Ah!  Worthwhile hobby nature boy!  PROFESSOR Interesting!  Very very interesting!  Whatever they are?

Ginger is a...well she's kind of like well...she's kind of like a girl you know she's kind of...  Ginger enters the hut wearing her flowery island girl costume.  GINGER What's going on?  When Ginger enters, the Mosquitoes realize that Ginger is NOT Mrs. Howell and react as expected.   BINGO Like you said...Ginger's a girl!   GILLIGAN I'll get Mrs. Howell.  Gilligan exits the hut to get Mrs. Howell.  MARY ANN Oh...welcome to the island!  GINGER They are cute!  And will you look at that hair!  How would you like to run your finger's through that!?  MARY ANN Oh fingers!? I could go in up to my elbows!  Mary Ann and Ginger start to make some moves on the Mosquitoes.  Ginger starts to fell Bongo's hair as he backs away using Bingo as a shield.  BONGO Please!  Please!  Bingo!  BINGO Back! Back! Don't handle the merchandise huh!  MARY ANN Ginger ah one of them is tall and one of 'em's is short, one of 'em's blond and one of 'em's is dark!  GINGER Yeah! A smorgasbord!  BONGO Down girls! Down!  BINGO Peace and quiet!  That's all we want is peace and quiet!  We came here to get away from girls!  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The Mosquitoes are coming out of the hut's doorway as Mrs. Howell is seen walking on camera with a pair of scissors.  MRS HOWELL There you are!  Thurston said you needed haircuts.   BINGO Split man!  It's the Barber of Seville!  The Mosquitoes panic at the thought of having their hair chopped off by Mrs. Howell and frantically run away with Mrs. Howell hot on their heels.  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - DAY  The skipper is packing items into his sea chest. Gilligan enters the hut in an excited state.  GILLIGAN Skipper!?  Skipper, have I got some good news for you!  SKIPPER It certainly is a good day for it Gilligan!  GILLIGAN The Mosquitoes are going to give us just what we've been waiting for!  SKIPPER You bet!  A nice trip home!  GILLIGAN No guess again.

SKIPPER No, wait a minute Gillian. Maybe you better not tell 'em, we don't want to get 'em upset. We'll listen to their concert and THEN we'll go home!  GILLIGAN I'll bet we're the luckiest people alive!  SKIPPER We certainly are! We're finally being rescued!  GILLIGAN No!  I mean about the Mosquitoes giving us a concert!  SKIPPER Oh well certainly yes.  GILLIGAN Here let me help you.  Gilligan closes the sea chest on the skipper's hand who yells out in pain.  FLIP TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Mr. and Mrs. Howell are getting ready to go to the concert.  Mr. Howell does not appear overly enthusiastic.  Mrs. Howell seems to enjoy the though of going out.  The Mosquitoes can be heard playing rock and roll music in the background.  MRS HOWELL Oh I just adore concerts!  I do wish the Mosquitoes would stop tuning up and start the music.  MR HOWELL They have stopped tuning up.  That IS the music!  MRS HOWELL Oh dear...OH DEAR Thurston, then we'd better hurry!  They probably won't seat us in the middle of the first act!  Come on darling!  MR HOWELL I wish we could be that LUCKY that we wouldn't be seated at ALL!  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - STAGE - NIGHT  The Mosquitoes have been singing one of their hit songs and we come in just at the end of the song.  MOSQUITOES Don't bug me, please just let me be...girl  Don’t bug me, let my heart be free Go on now Don't bug me, please just let me be...girl   The Mosquitoes end their first number and Mary Ann and Gilligan start screaming with delight.  The Mosquitoes immediately begin their second number.  MOSQUITOES One...two...three...

I told you so I told you so I told you so I told you so  The Mosquitoes, ending their show take a bow.  BINGO Well that's it for tonight!  I wanna tell ya, ya been a good group.  And that a...we're sure our next month here on the island is gonna be just too much.  Thanks, good night.  The Mosquitoes leave the stage as the castaways can be seen reacting to the news.  SKIPPER Did he say another month!?  MRS HOWELL Well don't they realize we'll miss the opera season!?  MARY ANN Well I'm all packed!  GINGER Well what are you smiling at Mr. Howell?  MRS HOWELL What's wrong Thurston darling?  GINGER He's been looking that way throughout the concert Mrs. Howell.  PROFESSOR Maybe there's more to this tuneless discord than I can comprehend?  GILLIGAN Maybe he developed an ear for rock and roll?  MRS HOWELL Oh he's got his earplugs in.  Thurston take them out.  Mr. Howell doesn't respond.  MRS HOWELL TAKE THEM OUT!  He still does not respond.  Mrs. Howell taps Mr. Howell on the shoulder to get his attention.  Mr. Howell removes the earplugs.  MRS HOWELL The concert's over dear.  MR HOWELL Oh...oh oh the concerts...wonderful marvelous just just absolutely thrilling thrilling encore!  SKIPPER Well here's something you'll get a thrill out of Mr. Howell.  We're going to be here for another month!  GILLIGAN Yeah, and they'll probably give concert after concert after concert!  MR HOWELL Oh good heavens! My ear plugs!  Mr. Howell quickly puts his ear plugs back in and looks as he did before during the concert.  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Gilligan and the skipper are in their hammocks. Gilligan is happily listening to the Mosquitoes music while the skipper is in absolute agony.  GILLIGAN Skipper? Are you sleeping?  SKIPPER No Gilligan I'm still listening to the music!  GILLIGAN Yeah so am I!  Isn't it wild?  SKIPPER Wild?  GILLIGAN I think it's really great that they're gonna to be here a whole month.  Do you realize how much that'd cost to see them that often?  SKIPPER Gilligan I hope I NEVER get that rich.  GILLIGAN We'll have to be very very quiet if we want 'em to stay here on the island.  SKIPPER Certainly little buddy, I'll walk around on tippy toes!  GILLIGAN That's why they came to the island.  To find peace and quiet, and if they don't get it, they might as well go back to the states.  SKIPPER Never mind Gilligan.  Suddenly the skipper realizes that in order to get the Mosquitoes to leave, they have to disrupt their peace and quiet.  SKIPPER That's it! THAT’S IT!  Gilligan!  You've done it again little buddy!  The skipper gets up and runs out the hut door excitedly.  GILLIGAN Oh that's great!  I did it again!  What did I do?  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  The Mosquitoes are all asleep in the sleeping bags when Mary Ann and Ginger pop up outside the hut's window.  GINGER The Mosquitoes!  MARY ANN The Mosquitoes??!!  MARY ANN and GINGER AAAHHHHH!!!  Both Mary Ann and Ginger start to enter the hut.  Mary Ann and Ginger scream wildly like crazed fans. The Mosquitoes are awakened by the screams and are totally taken by surprise.  Bingo jumps up to see what's going on.  BINGO What was that!  BANGO I don't know. What's happening!?  BONGO I don't know!  Mary Ann and Ginger, now in the hut, are still screaming and acting like crazed fans.  (Transcribers note: The frenzy that follows is almost impossible to decipher.  Bits and pieces of dialog can be heard, but it sounds more like adlibbing)  MARY ANN I just love 'em!!  GINGER It's so groovy!!  MARY ANN I have to have a souvenir!!  Mary Ann and Ginger grab a guitar and fight over it.  GINGER I want it!!  The guitar's neck breaks off.  BONGO Hey my guitar!  Look what you've done to my guitar!  MARY ANN I want his pajamas!!  GINGER I want one too!  Mary Ann starts to grab Bongo's pajama top while he' standing in his sleeping bag helpless.  BONGO Bingo Help!!  Mary Ann succeeds in ripping his pajama top from him and is obviously thrilled.  The professor can be seen entering the hut.  BINGO That's enough! Enough girls!  You girls have had your fun now...DOC give us a hand will ya!?  PROFESSOR Ah later!  Ah Mr. Bongo I should like to conduct an experiment.  Now these electrodes will test your brain waves when you play.  The professor attempts to put a crudely made pair of headsets on Bongo who reacts with horror.  BONGO Ah! DOC no! Your not gonna make any Frankenstein out of me!  PROFESSOR It won't hurt.  It will just take a moment.  GINGER Here's the one I like!  The strong silent type!  IRVING Yike!!  GINGER Oh come on Irving!  Gilligan reenters the hut carrying coconuts.  Irving is seen leaping out the hut's window headfirst.  GILLIGAN Oh boy a party!  Gilligan walks over to a couple of the Mosquitoes with the coconuts.  GILLIGAN Could you autograph these coconuts for me please?  BANGO Do WHAT?!  Mrs. Howell next enters the hut with a pair of scissors and starts making advances towards Bingo.  BINGO This is ridiculous! This is ridiculous! Call off Mrs. money bags!  The skipper enters the hut and begins his banter.  SKIPPER All right it's time for your exercises! Deep knee bends!  The skipper takes Bongo by the shoulders, still in his sleeping bag and forces him up and down.  SKIPPER That's the thing, deep knee bends!  Mr. Howell is the next and last to enter the hut.  Now all seven castaways and the four Mosquitoes are together in what can only be called total chaos!  MR HOWELL Gather around, gather around!  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! As your new manager I have something to say.  BINGO Oh no not you too!  MR HOWELL I have plans that are really really really really big!  Concerts, one night stands, movies, television...  BINGO THAT DOES IT!!  I mean it!  That really does it!  We're leaving tomorrow!  Come on fellas lets get out of here.  The Mosquitoes leave the hut leaving the castaways behind.  SKIPPER Did you here what they said!  We're leaving tomorrow!!  The castaways are extremely happy and form a conga line and start chanting as they head out the door and into the clearing.

FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The skipper and professor are seated at a table concerned over their problem when Gilligan runs on camera with a coconut marked with an X.  GILLIGAN Hey...Hey have you seen the autograph that Bango gave me!?  See the X see!  SKIPPER Yes we've seen it Gilligan!  PROFESSOR I must admit that I underestimated the reaction that would set in.  SKIPPER Oh professor we should've kept an eye on 'em!  GILLIGAN You just don't understand 'em skipper. They're a high strung nervous type.  I mean being sensitive musicians...  SKIPPER Never mind that Gilligan.  We start to hear music playing in the background.  SKIPPER Gilligan will you turn that radio off!  GILLIGAN What radio?  PROFESSOR It's not around here skipper.

BINGO Yeah when we give the word then we'll all move out!  GILLIGAN That sounds fair.  Mrs. Howell is seen running out of the jungle after Irving.

It's called "I want to go back to Pago Pago Pago Ya Ya Ya with you".  SKIPPER Two months! In two months Gilligan I'm going from a deserted island to an isolation ward! A padded cell...  Mr. Howell walks into the hut looking tired.  GILLIGAN Did we wake you up Mr. Howell?  MR HOWELL No I was only half asleep I lost one of my earplugs. Any of you happen to find it?  SKIPPER No we haven't seen it Mr. Howell!!  GILLIGAN Maybe one of the Mosquitoes found it.  MR HOWELL Well I'm afraid to ask them they're so touchy!  Skipper gets up in a huff.  GILLIGAN What's the matter skipper?  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan supposing we do stay on our side on the island...mind our own business for two months.  I mean how do we know they're not going to change their minds.  They disappeared once before they...they'd probably go off without us again!  MR HOWELL Good grief you're right, the Mosquitoes might buzz off without us!  GILLIGAN Oh they wouldn't do that.  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan for goodness sakes...we're not dealing with regular people, we're dealing with musicians!  They're in a world of their own!  GILLIGAN Yeah I guess you're right.  Show people just like show people.  MR HOWELL By George Gilligan...you have done it again! Amazing!  Mr. Howell gets up and leaves the hut.  GILLIGAN Oh boy I did it again!

DISSOLVE TO: EXT - STAGE - DAY  The four men are dressed in strange clothing and each one has an instrument.  Gilligan is on the drums, while the other three have crudely built guitars.  They start to play a very course song, which resembles one of the ones the Mosquitoes played earlier. On the drums Gilligan is playing is a drawing of a Gnat.  (Transcribers note: With the exception of a few words, the "noise" the GNATs make is pure Gibberish)  GILLIGAN One...two...two...three...four...five  They play wildly on stage as Mary Ann, Ginger and Mrs. Howell look on from benches in front of the stage.  The Mosquitoes, hearing the "music" and come watch. They actually watch in horror as the "Gnats" play one of their own songs.  After the number is concluded, the Mosquitoes run off into the jungle.  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - DAY  The skipper is seated at a table looking depressed as Gilligan plays on the drums.  GILLIGAN Skipper, all we need is a little more practice.   SKIPPER Oh Gilligan, the Mosquitoes thought we were awful.  GILLIGAN Oh boy, a little bit of criticism and you fall apart.  You can't start from the top you know!  SKIPPER Gilligan, I'll start from the top of your head and put you in the ground like a thumbtack!  GILLIGAN Remember the show must go on!  SKIPPER Gilligan will you please be quiet.

Gilligan is getting Mary and Ginger to autograph some coconuts for him.  GILLIGAN Thanks for the autograph's girls.  I tried to get Mrs. Howell's, but Mr. Howell was charging a dollar a piece for 'em.  SKIPPER Gilligan will you finish packing!  We see Mr. and Mrs. Howell entering the hut.  MR HOWELL (To Mrs. Howell) I can hardly wait to get back to our car. We're double parked you know!  MRS HOWELL Oh yes and we left the engine running.  GINGER Come on let's go down to the beach.

PROFESSOR Hold it hold it you can all just start to unpack!  SKIPPER UNPACK!!  What do you mean unpack!?  PROFESSOR The Mosquitoes left us a message.  GILLIGAN A message?  MR HOWELL They can write?  PROFESSOR Apparently.  Professor begins reading the letter out loud.  PROFESSOR Hi gang.  Me and the boys...  Professor is obviously distressed at the poor grammar.  PROFESSOR Me and the boys decided to take off this morning when the helicopter came by with provisions.  As for the Honey Bees...  MARY ANN As for the Honeybees!?  Mary Ann reacts immediately.  She grabs the letter and continues.  MARY ANN As for the Honeybees your good gals...just a little too good and we've got enough competition.

PAN RIGHT WITH SKIPPER TO PROFESSOR AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  Mr. and Mrs. Howell and the professor are working in the clearing as the skipper walks on camera.  SKIPPER Hi folks! Have you seen the radio?  PREOFESSOR No I haven't seen it. Maybe the girls have got it.  The professor, still working, bends down and off camera.  MR HOWELL Ah skipper, it's very fascinating the professor's making a mirror for Mrs. Howell.  MRS HOWELL Yes, maybe he'll make one for you too!  SKIPPER Oh well thanks, I'd rather have the radio not a mirror. Ha…ha I more interested in good news than bad news ha…ha…ha.  The skipper laughs but it becomes obvious that Mr. and Mrs. Howell don't understand the joke.  CUT TO: INT – GINGER AND MARY ANN'S HUT – DAY  CLOSE UP OF RADIO  PULL BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT OF GINGER AND MARY ANN  On the radio is an exercise program the girls are exercising to. We see the skipper start to walk by their window and stops to look in. Their backs are to the window while the radio is on a bench just below the window.  RADIO ONE TWO THREE FOUR. ONE TWO THREE FOUR. ONE TWO THREE FOUR. ONE TWO THREE FOUR. ONE TWO THREE FOUR. ONE TWO THREE FOUR. AND NOW YOU CAN REST.  The skipper reaches down to the radio and switches it off. The girls are standing as they wait for the announcer to begin again. The skipper puts his hand over his mouth and tries to mimic the announcer.

PAN DOWN WITH MARY ANN AND GINGER  The skipper says no more and just watches as the girls' squat down for their first deep knee bend.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND GINGER  After a time, they begin to get uncomfortable. The skipper is having the time of his life watching them sweat it out.  MARY ANN I wonder why he has us down here so long?  GINGER I don't know! If we had been doing these exercises all along, we'd be in good shape.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper is enjoying watching the girls suffer.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN AND GINGER  MARY ANN I don't see how you can exercise in that dress it's so tight. I'm surprised it doesn't cut off your circulation!  GINGER Honey, in Hollywood, the tighter the dress, the more the girl circulates.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper has a look of surprise on his face after hearing Ginger.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF MARY ANN, SKIPPER AND GINGER  The skipper has tortured the girls enough and decides to speak up.  SKIPPER And what are you ladies doing down there?  The girls realize they've been had, stand up and make their way to the skipper.  MARY ANN AND GINGER Skipper!  Mary Ann looks at the radio.

SKIPPER But I never used them!!  PROFESSOR Well batteries can lose power just sitting on a shelf!  The professor takes the batteries out of the radio and as he examines them he lights up!  PROFESSOR Hey! Wait a minute skipper we're in luck!  SKIPPER Yeah, bad luck.  PROFESSOR No, these batteries are rechargeable!  SKIPPER Professor, how can we recharge batteries here on the island!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN We don't even have a credit card.  PROFESSOR Seawater! I use to do this experiment in my science class. We used seawater instead of battery acid to re-vitalize old dry cell batteries and produce electricity!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER Seawater! Well what are we waiting for!? We've got enough sea water to light up every light on Broadway!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  PROFESSOR Now here's what we have to do. We need coconut shells, seawater, metal strips, pennies…  FLIP TO: EXT – CLEARING – DAY  CLOSE UP OF COCONUTS WITH METAL STRIPS AND WIRES  PROFESSOR (O.S.) The pennies are held in the seawater by the hairpins. The wire coming from the pennies leads to the positive pole of the battery.  PULL BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT – GROUP  The professor is at the head of the table while the remaining castaways are equally spaced on either side of the table. They all have small sticks at the ready.  PROFESSOR Metal strips on the other side of the coconut, lead to the negative pole of the battery. Now, everybody get ready to stir their coconuts, when I get the battery hooked up.  The professor makes his final connection.  PROFESSOR All right! Everybody stir!  Everyone starts to vigorously stir their respective coconut with their sticks.  MR HOWELL I wonder if Thomas Edison started this way?  Looks like a crazy Martini doesn't it?  FLIP TO: SAME SCENE – LATER  The castaways are all still stirring their coconuts.  PROFESSOR All right that should be enough. Now lets see if we can get anything.  Everyone stops stirring as the professor starts to unhook the battery from his makeshift charger.

GILLIGAN Oh I'm just straightening things so everything'll be nice and neat when it gets blown up.  Gilligan notices Mary Ann is hiding something.  GILLIGAN Ooo, what have you got behind your back!?

Oh you start thinking at a time like this and, well I haven't always been as nice to you as I should.  GILLIGAN Oh that's not true Mary Ann. You been very nice to me.  MARY ANN No I haven't! Take last night for instance. You wanted another piece of watermelon and I said no.  GILLIGAN You were right to say no that was my eighth piece!  MARY ANN But the point is Gilligan, if you had wanted it, why shouldn't you have eight?  Gilligan gets a set of silverware located in a large bamboo container.  GILLIGAN Because the first seven gave me a stomachache.  Gilligan sets down at his table and gets out the silverware.  MARY ANN We haven't got much time left between now and, you know when.  GILLIGAN When?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  Mary Ann gives Gilligan the we're gonna die look.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Oh, that when.

GILLIGAN In here skipper.  The skipper enters the hut carrying two coconut cream pies.  SKIPPER How 'bout that Mary Ann.  Gilligan sees the pies.  GILLIGAN Oh no.  SKIPPER She thought she wasn't being nice enough to me so she made me two pies! Actually she's been wonderful to me but, well, I haven't been very good to you little buddy.  GILLIGAN Oh that's not true skipper!!  SKIPPER Oh yes it is, now don't say that just to make me feel better. I know it's true. I know that I yell at you and bawl you out when you're really trying to do your very best! So, what I'm trying to say little buddy is, I want you to have one of my pies.  The skipper holds out one of the pies. Gilligan, already sick with eating two pies, doesn't want another one.  GILLIGAN Oh no skipper Mary Ann made it for you…  SKIPPER No no, I insist! Now little buddy just trying to make up for the way I've treated you. And I know that if Mary Ann had made you two pies for you, you'd give one to me! Now I want you to eat every bite.  GILLIGAN Skipper I like the way you treat me. I like the way you yell and shout at me.  SKIPPER You know before it's too late a man, should look at the people around him. And, figure out what he can do to make their lives happier! Oh little buddy, you don't know how happy you're going to make me feel when I see you eating this pie!  Gilligan gets up to explain when he…  GILLIGAN Oh no skipper I…  …pushes the pie right in the skipper's face. The skipper is bit shocked but maintains his composure.

MRS HOWELL What makes you so sure we're going to walk UP and not down?  MR HOWELL The reason I want to write a new will. Now let me see Lovey, up until now my favorite charity has always been me. But I think its time to think of other people, so I direct in that will, that all the money from the First National Bank be distributed among needy children.  MRS HOWELL Needy children! Oh Thurston that's a marvelous idea! That means of course all children living in Beverly Hills.  MR HOWELL Naturally. Now lets not forget medical science. We must help fight disease.  MRS HOWELL Which disease darling?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR HOWELL  MR HOWELL Well that is quite a problem deciding which one, so lets leave ten million dollars to each disease. That ought to take care of all the money in the a…Second National Bank.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL Are there that many diseases?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR HOWELL  MR HOWELL Well by the time they find our will in that bottle I think they'll discover some new diseases. Now what about the money in the, Third National Bank?

CUT TO: EXTREME CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR You're right Ginger, that's what's important. Saving people. I should never have become a teacher. Should have gone on with my work in science.

CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER, PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Sure does work!  PROFESSOR Well it's not exactly ground glass, but with that strong sun, I don't see how the plane could possibly miss it.  The skipper takes the binoculars and hands them to Gilligan.

CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON - DAY  WIDE SHOT  The missile is now almost to the shore of the lagoons as we…  CUT TO: MISSILE'S POINT OF VIEW  WIDE SHOT  We can see from the missiles point of view the fleeing castaways. We continue to see the castaways as they run off camera. The missile finally comes to a stop in the clearing and the engine stops.  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE CLEARING – DAY  WIDE SHOT OF PROFESSOR, MARY ANN, MR AND MRS HOWELL AND MISSILE  We see the missile now in the clearing. Clearly on the missile's side is the marking "X-1401-A".  PROFESSOR (WHISPERING) Don't make noise, don't even breath!  MARY ANN Oh we're not! I don't even think my heart's beating!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, PROFESSOR AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL Thurston you're so brave you're not even shaking.  MR HOWELL I can't. I think rigimortis has set in.  PROFESSOR Even a vibration could blow us up. Our only chance is to disarm it.  CUT TO CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, GILLIGAN AND GINGER  SKIPPER How do we do that!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, PROFESSOR AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  PROFESSOR Someone's going to have to remove the access panel and crawl inside. And there's only one of us small enough and thin enough to fit in there.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, GILLIGAN AND GINGER  GILLIGAN Who?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, PROFESSOR AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  They stare at Gilligan without saying a word.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, GILLIGAN AND GINGER  The skipper and Ginger stare intently at Gilligan. Gilligan knows "who". Ginger starts to give Gilligan a push in the missiles direction as we…  CUT TO: EXTREME WIDE SHOT – GILLIGAN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND MISSILE  Ginger is still giving Gilligan a slight push towards the missile.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MISSILES FORWARD SECTION  The Missile has come alive and is on automatic guidance. It's now making a sound much like that of submarine sonar.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, GILLIGAN AND GINGER  Gilligan is now backing up away from the missile with a frightened look.  CUT TO: MEDIUMS SHOT OF PROFESSOR, MARY ANN AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  They have a look of surprise.  CUT TO: EXTREME WIDE SHOT – GILLIGAN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND MISSILE  For some reason it has decided that Gilligan is the target. It continues to make rhythmic beeping sound, as it points towards Gilligan and starts to match his every move.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MISSILES FORWARD SECTION  The Missile is still making the sonar like sound.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan tries to pretend that he doesn't see the missile and starts walking one direction, the missile follows him.  CUT TO: EXTREME WIDE SHOT – GILLIGAN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND MISSILE  Again the missile still follows along with its sonar like sound as Gilligan slowly walks away.  CUT TO: MISSILE'S POV – PAN WITH GILLIGAN  As Gilligan moves to the left, the missile moves with him. As Gilligan approaches the skipper and Ginger, they push him away from them sending him to the right. The missile doesn't miss a beat.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan looks as though he's got a plan.   CUT TO: EXTREME WIDE SHOT OF GILLIGAN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND MISSILE  Gilligan is trying to outsmart the missile by faking it out. He goes in one direction and suddenly turns to go in the other. The missile stays glued to Gilligan anyway.  CUT TO: MISSILE POV - PAN WITH GILLIGAN  As Gilligan is running, he trips over a log and falls down.  QUICK CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MISSILE'S FORWARD SECTION  The missile has become quiet.  FLIP TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY – LATER  MEDIUM SHOT  The professor comes running out of the jungle carrying some tools.  PAN LEFT WITH PROFESSOR TO GROUP  The professor grabs Gilligan by the arm.    PAN RIGHT AND PULL BACK WITH PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN TO MISSILE'S FORWARD SECTION  PROFESSOR Come on Gilligan, I've got the tools.  GILLIGAN Maybe if we wait, they'll send a repairman.  PROFESSOR Oh please Gilligan, there may be a timing device.  He hands Gilligan some tools.  PROFESSOR Here you hold these. We'll take it very easy. I'll remove the access panel, that should have a chart with the color codes on it. That way I'll be able to figure out which wire you have to disconnect.  GILLIGAN Yeah.  The professor start to unscrew one of the screws holding the panel in place. He slips with the screwdriver and hits the panel.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  They are watching intently off camera as the professor and Gilligan attempt to get the panel off.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN AND MISSILE  With a pair of pliers in hand…  GILLIGAN (WHISPERING) Professor, you got to get in there and give it one good hit!  Gilligan takes a swing at the panel and is stopped by the professor. He ends up tossing the pliers off camera instead.  PROFESSOR Let me do this. Your job will come later.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  They're still watching from a safe distance.  FLIP TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN AND MISSILE  The professor had removed the panel and is ready the inner markings.  PROFESSOR Now Gilligan, your gonna have to find a green and yellow wire. And that wire will disarm the missile.  GILLIGAN A green and yellow wire, yeah.  Gilligan is stepping into the missile's opening.  PROFESSOR Now carefully.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND MR AND MRS HOWELL   They're watching off camera, as Gilligan is about to enter the missile.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Every moment counts.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan has gotten into the missile compartment and is ducking down inside.  PROFESSOR That's it.  CUT TO: INT – MISSILE COMPARTMENT – HALF SHELL  We see Gilligan in the cramped quarters of the missiles interior. It has circular reinforcements, wires and tubing running throughout. Gilligan is crawling along towards the missile's nose section. He comes across a bunch of wires and gives one a tug. There is the sound of a short circuit as he finds the wire.  GILLIGAN I found it!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN AND MISSILES FORWARD SECTION  The professor is reading the schematic diagram printed on the panel's inner surface as Gilligan's head emerges from the missile.  GILLIGAN I found it.  PROFESSOR Oh good.   CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  They're still watching intently.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Now, your gonna have to trace that…  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  (CONTINUED) …wire until you come to a buss bar.  GILLIGAN A bus bar?  PROFESSOR Yes a buss bar, is a long copper rectangle with a lot of wires attached to it. You'll have to take that wire of the connector, and that will disarm the missile.  GILLIGAN Oh.  Gilligan drops back down into the missile.  PROFESSOR And Gilligan.  He pops back up again.  GILLIGAN Yeah?  PROFESSOR If the end of that wire, touches any other connector, you'll blow us all up.  Gilligan does slowly turn towards the camera and looks frightened. He decides he'd better leave and starts to get out of the missile. The professor holds him back and pushes him back down inside the missile.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER, MARY ANN AND MR AND MRS HOWELL  The castaways are getting concerned  SKIPPER Take it easy little buddy.  MARY ANN Oh Gilligan, please be careful.  CUT TO: INT – MISSILE COMPARTMENT – HALF SHELL  Gilligan makes his way back towards the missile's nose cone.  GILLIGAN Oh yeah, here it is.  He finds the buss bar and using a screwdriver, starts to unscrew the wire from the block. He finishes and ends up shorting out the connector with his screwdriver. The missile immediately comes to life as the engine fires up.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT OF GROUP AND MISSILE  The missile's engine comes to life with roaring fire as smoke. The professor looks into the missile's compartment and then runs back.  As they see the missile start fire up, they all start to yell and scream.  ALL Gilligan!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan, trapped in the missile is aware that something is terribly wrong. The missile is shaking violently as it begins moving along the ground.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT OF GROUP AND MISSILE  The professor gets out of the way as the missile shoots along the ground and into the jungle.  PAN RIGHT WITH MISSILE TO JUNGLE  CUT TO: INT – MISSILE COMPARTMENT – HALF SHELL  Gilligan is still going for a ride. It's loud and shaking and he's getting very worried.  GILLIGAN Fire!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP SHOT – GROUP  The castaways are watching as the missile takes off through the jungle.  SKIPPER Gilligan's still in there!!  MR HOWELL He's in there that boy!  SKIPPER Why it's coming back!  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  WIDE SHOT  The missile, with its smoking tail shoots out of the jungle and is headed towards castaways.  PAN LEFT WITH MISSILE TO CLEARING  It shoots past the castaways and off camera ejecting a plume of smoke and fire from its exhaust.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, PROFESSOR, MR AND MRS HOWELL  They're watching as the missile and Gilligan shoot away and into the lagoon.  SKIPPER He didn't have chance to get out!  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON – DAY  WIDE SHOT  The missile shoots on camera and enters the lagoon still with rocket exhaust shooting from the rear.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, PROFESSOR, MR AND MRS HOWELL  They're watching as the missile and Gilligan disappear around the lagoon's inlet with a hopeless expression on their faces.  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF OCEAN BEACH AND PALM TREES  CUT TO: EXT – HUT CLEARING – DAY  MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  The castaways are all seated around the communal table and looking glum.  MRS HOWELL Thurston, I think we ought to rename the house in South Hampton, Gilligan's acres.  MR HOWELL I was going to have a Gilligan scholarship at Harvard.  CUT TO: EXT – HUT CLEARING – DAY  WIDE SHOT  Gilligan walks on camera from around the hut, soaking wet.  SKIPPER (O.S.) The next boat I get, I'm gonna call her,…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER …the Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER AND MARY ANN  GINGER When I get back to Hollywood, I'm gonna sell a story to the movies.  Mary Ann, all choked up, starts to cry.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is standing soaking wet.  GILLIGAN Gee it all sounds so wonderful I think I'll go back and drown myself!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP  The all react as they see Gilligan alive and well. They leap from the table and all approach Gilligan excited.  PAN LEFT WITH GROUP TO GILLIGAN  They start to encircle Gilligan and give him hugs and pats on the back as we…  FADE OUT              EPILOG  FADE IN:  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  MEDIUM SHOT  Gilligan is seen walking on camera from the jungle carrying something behind his back.  PAN LEFT AND PULL BACK TO MR HOWELL  Mr. Howell is sitting in a lounge chair as Gilligan approaches.  GILLIGAN Mr. Howell?  MR HOWELL Uh, ep…yes yes Gilligan my boy what is it?  GILLIGAN Mr. Howell, remember when everybody thought they were gonna be blown up. Remember how nice they were to each other?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR HOWELL AND GILLIGAN FAVORING MR HOWELL  MR HOWELL Gilligan my boy, when people are in trouble, they make concessions and promises. And when their trouble is over, they forget those, fancy promises.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE FAVORING GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Would YOU Mr. Howell?  MR HOWELL A Howell go back on his word!? Never! Our family crest,…  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE FAVORING MR HOWELL  (CONTINUED) …honesty, fidelity, integrity!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF MR HOWELL AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I thought so.  With that said, Gilligan takes a bottle out from behind his back and Mr. Howell sees the it.  MR HOWELL Uh…e…what's that?  GILLIGAN Oh, it's your will Mr. Howell. I found it when I swam out of the missile. I'm just throwing it back in the water now.  Gilligan throws the bottle of camera, which prompts Mr. Howell to go spastic. He leaps off the lounge and starts to run off camera headed for the bottle.  MR HOWELL NO! NO MY Boy Don't!!  ZOOM IN ON GILLIGAN  We hear the bottle fly into the water as Mr. Howell is still yelling and having a fit. Gilligan is left standing open mouthed as he watches Mr. Howell.  MR HOWELL (O.S.) No no noooooo!  Mr. Howell is heard practically crying as well.   FADE OUT:     END CREDITS 
Episode #98, "Gilligan The Goddess" (Three natives come to the island looking for a 'White Goddess'. CBS didn't realize that this would be the LAST show!)   GILLIGAN'S ISLAND  Gilligan the Goddess  By  Jack Paritz  And  Bob Rodgers  April 17, 1967  TEASER FADE IN  EXT – LAGOON INLET – DAY  An outrigger canoe is seen making it's way to the lagoon by way of the lagoon inlet. In the canoe can be seen several natives.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF CANOE  We see three natives in the canoe. One is riding high in the center while the other two are paddling.  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON PATH – DAY  Mary Ann is seen running along the Lagoon's East pathway as she flees the approaching natives.  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON BEACH – DAY  Gilligan is seen erecting an S O S sign made from a sheet and two bamboo poles. The sheet is able to roll up using a cord much like a blind. He bends over to pick up something and in the process, rolls up the SOS sign. While the sign is in the up position, Mary Ann runs on camera, between the bamboo polls and off camera. Gilligan stands up as he hears something, and catches a glimpse of Mary Ann running by and the sign rolls back down.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Ginger is seen running along the same path Mary Ann took only moments ago.  CUT TO: EXT LAGOON BEACH - DAY  Gilligan bends over again and the sign rolls back up, just as Ginger runs between the bamboo polls. He stands back up again and the sign rolls back down as he catches sight of Ginger running past.   GILLIGAN What do they think this is a freeway!?  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON PATH – DAY  The natives are seen running along the same path Mary Ann and Ginger took.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan is back at work on the sign. He hears a sound and sees the natives approaching. He panics and runs straight into the sign. The recoil of hitting the sign makes him fall backwards as the sign falls on top of him, his legs the only thing visible.  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON PATH - DAY  The natives are still running after Mary Ann and Ginger.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP – GILLIGAN UNDER SIGN  The natives, one by one run over the top of Gilligan, stepping on him as they go. They are unaware that Gilligan is under the sign. After they pass, Gilligan manages to partially crawl out from under the sign with a look of defeat on his face as we…  FADE OUT       ACT ONE  FADE IN  EXT – MARY ANN AND GINGER'S HUT – DAY  Mr. Howell is seen sitting in his lounge chair in front of Mary Ann and Ginger's hut sipping on a drink relaxing. First Mary Ann and then Ginger run past into the hut screaming as they go.  MR HOWELL (GROGGY) Ah…can't…a man have a little peace around here, a little nap?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP – MR HOWELL  The natives have made there way to the clearing and come upon Mr. Howell. One of the natives addresses Mr. Howell in their native tongue.  KING KILLIWANI Ula Ule U'wama.  Mr. Howell takes notice of there presence and we see…  PULL BACK TO WIDE SHOT  Three natives are standing behind Mr. Howell. Mr. Howell immediately reaches over to the side of the lounge chair and crabs a golf club from his golfing gear which is setting next to his lounge.  MR HOWELL Lay a hand on me and I'll, take this five iron and wrap it around head!  KING KILLIWANI Hold! We come in peace.  MR HOWELL Oh, a sort of primitive peace corps! Well let's introduce each other. My name is Thurston Howell the third, what exactly is yours?  The king snaps his fingers and his two native body guards take up their positions.  KING KILLIWANI I, am KING Killiwani! Emperor of eternal night! Light of eternal day! Seeker of eternal truth! And lord of eternal eternalties!  The native to his right whispers something in the kings ear.  KING KILLIWANI Oh yes, keeper of eternal flame.  MR HOWELL Oh a gas tycoon! Well I always like to do business with chairman of the board.  GUARD NO. 1 Amu wamu.  MR HOWELL I'll come right to the point. Can you rescue us and take us back to civilization, and what exactly will it cost, ME.  KING KILLIWANI Must find white goddess Winomi.  MR HOWELL Yes well of course we'll discuss the scavenger hunt a little later. Now to rescue us would you say a fair price would be a…a…a thousand dollars?  KING KILLIWANI No talk rescue!  MR HOWELL I'll talk louder! Would you say, five thousand dollars?  KING KILLIWANI Legend say that on eighth moon, white goddess Winomi will be found on island to west!  MR HOWELL Wha…wha…why I know your changing the subject, driving a hard bargain. Well, I can be pushed so far! One hundred thousand dollars and that is my final offer!  The native to the kings right is getting tired of Mr. Howell's banter.  GUARD NO. 1 Halu yama e'kwana!  KING KILLIWANI Halu hala da'wama.  Soon time for new year feast! Must find goddess Winomi!  MR HOWELL Well let's settle this white goddess business. Where exactly, pray tell do we FIND her!?  KING KILLIWANI Already find two! Problem is, only need one!  MR HOWELL Oh you mean Ginger or Mary Ann! Now if one of them is the white goddess, you'll rescue us?  The king responds with an affirmative grunt.  KING KILLIWANI Ehhhhh  MR HOWELL Oh joy I just saved one hundred thousand dollars!!  Mrs. Howell walks on camera unaware of the natives standing by. She's carrying a bouquet of flowers.  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston look at these marvelous blooms…  The king sees her and immediately reacts. He and his guards immediately drop to the ground on their knees and bend over, their arms outreached as a sign of respect.  KING KILLIWANI Ahhhh!  Mrs. Howell sees the natives bowing to her and reacts indifferently.  MRS HOWELL Who are these persons? And what are they doing down there?  MR HOWELL Ah Lovey I'd like you to meet his majesty, King Killiwani.  MRS HOWELL King?  KING KILLIWANI Emperor of eternal night! Light of eternal day! Seeker of…  MR HOWELL Eh…no need to go through all that again. He's really a king!  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston royalty!  MR HOWELL Eh…wait till he stands up, he's really king size.  MRS HOWELL Please your majesty do stand up!  The king and his guards get up from the ground.  KING KILLIWANI Oh, this is truly island of white goddess.  MRS HOWELL Thurston did you hear that? What a charming thing for him to say. I wonder if he knows Grace and prince Rainier? Indeed an honor your majesty.  Mrs. Howell kneels before the king.  MRS HOWELL May I extend to you the hospitality of our little island.  Gilligan unaware that the king and his men are friendly, has sprung a trap by dropping a net on them. The king start yelling expletives in his native tongue. Gilligan can be seen on the roof of the hut being very pleased with himself.  CUT TO: GILLIGAN ON HUT ROOF  GILLIGAN I got'em I got'em tie'em up tie'em up!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  MR HOWELL Gilligan you dunts you did it again! These savages are civilized!  Mr. And Mrs. Howell are trying to help the king and his men out from under the net.  MRS HOWELL Forgive is your majesty, what a deplorable breach of protocol!  Mr. Howell makes his way to the far side of the net and starts to lift it.  MR HOWELL Here ah…the rear escape hatch.  Gilligan is still on the roof as Mr. And Mrs. Howell continue to help the king and his men out from under the net as we…  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON – DAY  The skipper and the professor are standing near the Lagoon inspecting the canoe the King and his men came in.  PROFESSOR …outrigger's doing here!? If I'm not mistaken it's the handy work of the primitive Papuan tribe. Oh I had no idea we where so near their island.  The skipper and professor are inspecting the canoe when the skipper reaches in and finds something metal.  SKIPPER But professor ep…if they're so primitive, how did they get this?  Surprisingly the skipper holds up a silver cigarette lighter.  PROFESSOR It means they must have contact with civilization.  FLIP TO: EXT – HUT CLEARING – DAY  King Killiwani and his men are standing in the clearing. The king is obviously distressed over something.  KING KILLIWANI MUST have eternal flame!  The professor and the skipper emerge from the jungle and find the king.  PROFESSOR Your highness!  KING KILLIWANI Heh!  PROFESSOR Is this your lighter?   KING KILLIWANI Hah! You find eternal flame!!

KING KILLIWANI YOU care to dance.  GILLIGAN No I don't think so.  Gilligan starts to walk away just as the king grabs his arm and pulls him back.  KING KILLIWANI You DANCE!  GILLIGAN Come to think of it I do need the practice!  The king, his men and Gilligan all start chanting and dancing around the fire as we…  FLIP TO: INT – MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT – DAY  Mrs. Howell is sitting on her bed with Mr. Howell on his knees in front of her. He has his teddy bear and looks as though he's about to propose marriage.  MRS HOWELL Oh of course I'll be their little white goddess.  If it means a chance of getting off this silly island.  MR HOWELL Oh Lovey we knew you'd cooperate!  Mrs. Howell gets off the bed as Mr. Howell gets off his knees.  MRS HOWELL Darling after all I've had so much experience.

MARY ANN Would I be too far off if I guessed Mrs. Howell?  Ginger has sat down at her make-up  table and starts looking at herself in a mirror.  GINGER When I think of some women's ego, just makes me sick. I mean after all who'd make a better goddess than me?  Mary Ann, seeing her chance, walks over to Ginger.  MARY ANN Well ah…know that you brought it up. I could think of just one other person.  GINGER Who?  MARY ANN Me.  GINGER You!? Well your too short!  MARY ANN Well goddesses don't have to be tall! Why they just have to be…(pause)…like goddesses!  GINGER I'm surrounded by ego maniacs!  CUT TO: EXT – HUT CLEARING - DAY  Mr. Howell out of his hut with Mrs. Howell who is dressed in a flowing white dress.  MR HOWELL I…I have good news! Behold your white goddess!  MRS HOWELL This is the most thrilling moment of my life!  King Killiwani is amazed at Mrs. Howell and is about to speak just the skipper walks on camera with Mary Ann, also in a flowing white dress.  SKIPPER Your majesty! Here is your goddess!  The King takes a look at Mary Ann and is impressed, but Mrs. Howell becomes indignant.  MRS HOWELL Mine is the original!  Just then the professor walks on camera.  PROFESSOR Your Highness, guess what I found!?  KING KILLIWANI Eh…Don't tell me.  PROFESSOR The goddess, Winomi!  Ginger comes walking out from the jungle all dressed in white like the others. All three "white goddesses stand looking at each other.  GINGER Heh, looks like we all came off the same rack!  King Killiwani stands with his guards and looks perplexed.  KING KILLIWANI What we do now.  GILLIGAN Why don't you try, eeny meeny miney moe?  King Killiwani smacks Gilligan in the chest.  KING KILLIWANI Good idea!  The king starts pointing at the women as he recites the children's selection poem.  KING KILLIWANI Eeny meeny miney moe Catch'em goddess by'em toe Soon to island back we go Eny meeny miny moe!  The kings finger points to Mrs. Howell who seems elated at being selected.  GUARD NO. 1 The Gods have spoken!  GINGER Oh now I've seen everything! You a goddess!?  MRS HOWELL Well I'm most capable of coping with the protocol involved! You see I was presented at the court of saint James.  MR HOWELL Not to mention Prune Queen!  MRS HOWELL Pitted Prune Queen!  MARY ANN I think this whole contest is fixed!  GINGER And I know by whom! What I want to know is by how MUCH!  MARY ANN I've had enough!  GINGER MORE than enough!  Mary Ann and Ginger walk off camera in a huff.  PROFESSOR Girls remember the big picture! We're going to be rescued!  MR HOWELL Sore losers!  KING KILLIWANI You make volcano God very happy!  MRS HOWELL Volcano God!  KING KILLIWANI At end of ceremony you marry volcano.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper, I never knew volcanoes could get married!  KING KILLIWANI Big honor for goddess Winomi.  MRS HOWELL To be thrown into a volcano!?  MR HOWELL No man is going to throw my wife into a volcano!  KING KILLIWANI Wife? She your WIFE!?  MR HOWELL Yes, I'm very honored!  KING KILLIWANI Ehhh…too bad. Goddess Winomi must be maiden. Girl with mate can not be bride to volcano.  Mrs. Howell is totally relieved.  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston thank you for being my mate!  MR HOWELL Yes darling!  KING KILLIWANI Must find ONE from other two!  GILLIGAN You mean Ginger or Mary Ann?  KING KILLIWANI I choose.  SKIPPER Oh no, wait a minute King! Now look, we don't like your rules so the game is over!  KING KILLIWANI Over!?  SKIPPER That's right! We'd like to get you a white goddess but, you play too rough!!  GILLIGAN I'm sorry this store is closed, try another market!  SKIPPER Nice going little buddy!  GILLIGAN Thank you.  SKIPPER Your welcome.  KING KILLIWANI Last word?  SKIPPER Definitely.  KING KILLIWANI We go!  The King snaps his fingers and the guards accompany the King out of the clearing.  MR HOWELL Perhaps if it was a shallow volcano.  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston!  MR HOWELL But we were going to be rescued if you'd just…heh…heh…heh…  SKIPPER Say those natives took it better than I thought they would!  GILLIGAN I wonder where they went?  SKIPPER I don't know.  Just then the King and his men return with what appears to be blow guns, answering Gilligan's question as to where they went.  KING KILLIWANI Must have white goddess by sundown!!  SKIPPER They've got poisonous blow guns!  GILLIGAN Now I know what they went for!  KING KILLIWANI One of your woman must go! Or take by force!  SKIPPER Poison or no poison, your going to get one of our girls over our dead bodies!  MR HOWELL Oh he's so impetuous!  With that said, the guards raise their blow guns and shoot a poison dart at the castaways. It shoots past them and gets stuck in a plane sitting near the hut. The plant's leaves immediately drop as if it just died.  GILLIGAN Oh skipper, can we lay down now?  FADE OUT     ACT TWO  FADE IN  STOCK SHOT – EXTERIOR MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT  CUT TO: INT – MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT – DAY  The skipper, Gilligan, Mr. Howell and the professor are sitting around the table in the hut discussing their situation.  SKIPPER Well I'm all for jumping 'em! There's only three of them and there's four of us.  PROFESSOR Use your head skipper, just one poison dart and it would be three against three!  GILLIGAN Yeah and another poison dart, three against two, and another poison dart three against one, and another poison dart three against…  SKIPPER Gilligan!  GILLIGAN …none.  MR HOWELL There must be some way of doing this without anyone getting hurt. Especially a Howell!  GILLIGAN The only way to do that is to give 'em a white goddess.  SKIPPER Well they're not getting one of our girls!  GILLIGAN Maybe they'd settle for a girl gorilla or something.  SKIPPER Oh that's the most ridiculous thing I ever…  PROFESSOR Now wait a minute wait a minute. Perhaps we can trick them. Perhaps one of us could dress as…  MR HOWELL A gorilla!?  PROFESSOR No no no, as a woman.  SKIPPER Did I hear you right!?  PROFESSOR Why not!? One of us could dress as a woman and volunteer to go with them.  GILLIGAN Yeah and get thrown in a volcano!  PROFESSOR Oh of course not! The rest of the men could follow in a raft and keep watch at a safe distance.  SKIPPER Oh and keep checking on any visiting ships that might be at their island!  MR HOWELL Now wait a minute. Look around the table, you think that anyone of us could pass as a white goddess?  PROFESSOR You have a better idea?  MR HOWELL Well of course!  SKIPPER What is it?  MR HOWELL Haven't thought of anything yet.  FLIP TO: INT – GINGER AND MARY ANN'S HUT – DAY  Ginger is standing by a privacy screen waiting for the skipper to come out.  GINGER You need any help?  SKIPPER Wa…wa…no thank you Ginger bu…eh…I'm afraid I…I just killed your living girdle.  GINGER Come on out, let me have a look at you.  The skipper comes from around the privacy screen wearing Gingers orange sarong style dress.  GINGER Well turn around.  The skipper fills out the dress a little too much and when he turns around, we can see a several inch gap running down the back of the dress revealing his under garments. He's also wearing a fake wig and is heavily made up with makeup.  SKIPPER Well what do you think?  GINGER Well ah…you've got nothing to worry about if they throw you the a volcano.  SKIPPER (HAPPILY) I don't!?  GINGER Eh…no it would through you right back!  FLIP TO: INT – PROFESSOR'S HUT – DAY  Mary Ann is helping the professor zip up a dress he has on. He's wearing a scarf and high heels.  MARY ANN Take a deep breath. Now hold still or I'll catch you in the zipper.  The professor takes a deep breath and Mary Ann finishes zipping up the professor's dress.  MARY ANN There!  The professor turns around and stands with his hands on his hips to get Mary Ann's opinion.  PROFESSOR Mary Ann. I'd like your candid opinion. Do you think that I could pass as a woman?  MARY ANN Well, it depends on two things.  PROFESSOR Two things.  MARY ANN Mmm…mmm, How dark the night and how bad their eyesight.

HAROLD HECUBA (cont'd) Now, let me see now. Casting directory, swimming trunks, suntan oil, electric toothbrush. A-ha. Here it is! Spread that out, kid. Harold Hecuba hands a folded signal marker to Gilligan. SKIPPER Now just a minute, Mister Hecuba. You're a long way from Hollywood and I'm skipper of this island and I give the orders. GILLIGAN He's the skipper. He gives the orders. HAROLD HECUBA Is that a fact? Well, hear this and hear this good. Right now a couple of my flunkies are following me in a plane.

MR HOWELL Pussycat! HAROLD HECUBA Oh, if this is the best you have, I guess I'll just have to put up with it. MR HOWELL I'll have you know that Missus Howell and I are not sharing our quarters with a perfect stranger. HAROLD HECUBA Nobody's perfect. I wouldn't think of sharing this hovel with you and your wife. MR HOWELL Well, that's much better. HAROLD HECUBA You're moving out. I'm taking over. You and your wife will have to find other quarters. MR HOWELL This is outrageous. What nerve! What gall! SKIPPER (sotto) Mister Howell, please. He's gonna get us off the island.

MR HOWELL Mister Hecuba's gonna help us get off the island, my dear. MRS HOWELL Oh. What can I do for you, Mister Hecuba? HAROLD HECUBA Well, I'm so glad you asked. While I'm staying here at this island tenement I'm gonna need a butler and a maid, and you two will do very nicely. MRS HOWELL (indignantly) Really! MR HOWELL (indignantly) This is the last straw! Rescue or no rescue, the Howells are servants to no man. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - LATER Mrs. Howell, dressed in traditional maid attire, fans Harold Hecuba. Mr. Howell, dressed in traditional butler attire, carries a small tray with a drinking glass atop. The drinking glass contains a straw and a flower garnish. Harold Hecuba reclines on a chaise lounge chair. MR HOWELL Your martini. HAROLD HECUBA Ah, so it is. Lovely. Harold Hecuba takes the drink from Mr. Howell's tray and sips the drink through the straw. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GIRLS HUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT INT. SUPPLY HUT - NIGHT Mary Ann closes the food locker, having removed a seasoning shaker made from a gourd. Ginger tends to a pot on their stove. Mary Ann shakes the gourd to season the food in the pot. MARY ANN Impossible. He's absolutely impossible. Why should we be a servant to a self-centered, abusive, overbearing human being? Ginger picks up a bunch of grapes. Mary Ann samples the food from the pot by sipping from a wooden spoon. GINGER Mary Ann, that's the way producers are. I knew one producer in Hollywood for five years and in all that time he only smiled once. Mary Ann puts down the spoon. MARY ANN When was that? GINGER The day his yacht sank. MARY ANN And he smiled? GINGER Well, he just sold it. Mary Ann is puzzled. She looks at Ginger quizzically and then down at the dish on the stove and back at Ginger. GINGER (cont'd) To his mother-in-law. Mary Ann is still puzzled and looks back at Ginger GINGER (cont'd) She couldn't swim. Outside the hut, Harold Hecuba WHISTLES. Mary Ann grunts in frustration. MARY ANN His master's voice. GINGER Mary Ann, let me serve him, huh? FLIP TO: EXT. SUPPLY HUT - NIGHT Harold Hecuba sits at a small table outside the girls hut. A red and white checkered tablecloth covers it. A candle sits next to the place setting, including a bamboo drinking glass. A second chair remains empty. Harold Hecuba opens the matching napkin and places it on his lap. Ginger exits the girls hut. She's dressed as an Italian peasant girl, with a brunette wig, a torn mauve blouse, and a knee-length pleated green skirt. Ginger carries a tray. On the tray sits a small bowl with mixed fruits including grapes. GINGER (in Italian) "Santa lucia, santa lucia." Ginger thrusts the fruit bowl down on the table. Several grapes spill onto the table. HAROLD HECUBA Never mind the floorshow, kid. Get me some water. Harold Hecuba offers the bamboo drinking glass to Ginger, but she doesn't take it. GINGER (Italian accent) Water? Sure, I bring you water. Ginger puts her foot up on a chair. Ginger presses closer. GINGER (cont'd) (Italian accent) Eh, what do you care about the poor starving people so long as you stuff yourself with water, eh? Harold Hecuba pulls back as Ginger presses closer. HAROLD HECUBA What? GINGER (Italian accent) You want water. I don't have a dress to my name. HAROLD HECUBA What's that you're wearing? GINGER (Italian accent) This?! This is a dress that I share with my four sisters. Only one of us can go out at a time, and you want water! Harold Hecuba puts the bamboo drinking glass back down on the table. HAROLD HECUBA All right, forget the water. Just bring me some bread. GINGER (Italian accent) Bread! Now he wants some bread. Starving in the Piazza de Steve Reeves, and you want-a bread. All right, I get you bread. Ginger grabs the bamboo drinking glass from the table. GINGER (cont'd) (Italian accent) You stuff your fat face with bread. (in Italian) Mamma Mia, Chi è questo stupido? HAROLD HECUBA I think I saw this in a picture once. FLIP TO: EXT. SUPPLY HUT - LATER Ginger, wearing a blonde Marilyn Monroe wig and a tight-fitting sky blue dress worthy of Marilyn Monroe herself, backs out of the girls hut carrying a tray with a bamboo glass of water and a plate with bread. Harold Hecuba sits at the table. He eats the fruit from the bowl with a fork. A second chair remains empty. GINGER (sultry) Here you are, Mister Hecuba. Here's your bread and water. Ginger places the bamboo drinking glass and the plate down on the table. Ginger sits down on the other chair. HAROLD HECUBA What do you want, applause? Harold Hecuba returns to eating the fruit. Ginger lightly strokes Harold Hecuba's ear. GINGER (sultry) I don't know what you want with bread and water as long as I'm around. HAROLD HECUBA Please, kid, not while I'm eating, huh? Ginger gets more aggressive. She touches his face with both hands and draws his face to her direction. GINGER (sultry) You know, once men have tasted my lips, they're never satisfied with bread and water again. HAROLD HECUBA Hold it. Now, what's going on here? GINGER I just wanted to show you what a versatile actress I am, Mister Hecuba. Couldn't you see me starring in your new movie? HAROLD HECUBA Oh, you've got to be kidding. With that phony dialect and that overacting, in a Harold Hecuba production? Like the man said when he backed into the stove, "That's a hot one!" Harold Hecuba laughs heartily. Humiliated, Ginger gets up from the table and hurries away. HAROLD HECUBA (cont'd) (mocking Ginger's Italian accent) "I bring you bread-a! I bring you bread!" (laughing) It's too -- actors. Actors. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Ginger sits at a table outside of the girls hut and cries. Gilligan and Skipper try to console her. SKIPPER Ginger, how can you say that you won't go with us after we're rescued? Ginger holds back her tears long enough to explain why she's crying. GINGER I asked him for a part in his movie and he laughed at me. Ginger sobs. GILLIGAN Maybe it's a comedy. SKIPPER Will you stay out of this? GILLIGAN Anything you say, H.H. SKIPPER Now, Ginger, please, you don't need Mister Hecuba. I mean, you're gonna be returning to an adoring public. GINGER No. I'll return to find I'm an unknown, a has-been. Ginger sobs. SKIPPER Ginger, please now, your public hasn't forgotten you. GILLIGAN Yeah. Sure, it's just silly. Who can forget your performance as the girl in the--Or was it the sister? Niece? (to Skipper) Was it the mother? GINGER No. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life alone on this island. Ginger sobs. GILLIGAN I've got it! You were the sympathetic friend. GINGER No! Ginger sobs. Skipper motions to hit Gilligan over the head with his skipper's cap. Gilligan covers his head with his arms. Instead, Skipper hits Gilligan with his skipper's cap in the abdomen. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. SUPPLY HUT - DAY Professor, Gilligan, and Skipper sit at a long bamboo table and bamboo stools. On the table sit piles of stoneware dishes and a few bowls. SKIPPER Ginger said she won't go back with us even after we're rescued. She will not go back to Hollywood. PROFESSOR I'm afraid this is serious. When Hecuba laughed at Ginger's acting she became emotionally disturbed and psychologically maladjusted. GILLIGAN Not only that, she's upset. PROFESSOR If only Hecuba hadn't laughed at her. SKIPPER He's all heart, that guy. GILLIGAN He acts the same way with everybody, even Mister Howell. Mister Howell enters with a tray of drinks in coconut drinking glasses and sets one down next to Gilligan. SKIPPER Mister Howell! PROFESSOR Why are you serving us? Mister Howell puts a drink next to Skipper. MR HOWELL I don't know! It's become force of habit! What's happened to me? What has happened to me? Mister Howell exits with the drink for Professor still on the tray. SKIPPER Poor Mister Howell's in bad shape. We're gonna have to do something to help him. GILLIGAN I don't know. It's pretty nice having a butler. Gilligan leans over to sip at the straw in his drink, but is interrupted by Skipper. SKIPPER Gilligan. PROFESSOR Gentlemen, we were discussing Ginger. Now if she refuses to leave the island, we're facing a serious problem. GILLIGAN I have an idea. SKIPPER Gilligan, we don't need another one of your ideas. We're in enough trouble now. GILLIGAN I was thinking, if we put on a musical with Ginger as the star, H.H. would see how great she was. SKIPPER That's a great idea, Gilligan, a dumb one. Gilligan frowns, gets up from the table, and turns toward the wall. PROFESSOR Oh, on the contrary, that's a marvelous idea, Gilligan. Gilligan turns back to the table, smiles, and sits back down. SKIPPER But, Professor, when you put on a stage show, you gotta have rehearsals. H.H. has been running our legs off all day long. GILLIGAN But he doesn't call us at night. SKIPPER Oh, you're really something. (scoffs) At night! Gilligan gets up from the table again and faces the wall. PROFESSOR Why not? We could use torches. Gilligan turns back from the wall and sits down again. GILLIGAN Yeah, and we could rehearse in the clearing where he can't hear us. SKIPPER But Hecuba puts on musicals. It so happens that we don't have any musicals to put on. Professor stands and walks over to the small collection of books sitting on a nearby table. PROFESSOR The Howells have records and we brought some books. And books are always being made into musicals. SKIPPER Say, maybe we could make a musical out of some of those books. Skipper and Gilligan walk over to the table with the books. They select books and read the titles of some of them. PROFESSOR "Four-Masted Schooners I Have Known." SKIPPER Oh, that's mine, Professor. How about this one, "Integrated Calculus" by Zimmerman? PROFESSOR That's mine. GILLIGAN I knew it wasn't mine. PROFESSOR How about, "A Million Ways to Make a Million"? SKIPPER No, that's Mister Howell's. GILLIGAN How about, "Carpenter's Handbook"? SKIPPER (sarcastically) Oh, that would be a great musical, Gilligan. (mockingly) "Carpenter's Handbook." GILLIGAN Didn't you ever hear a musical saw? You know-- Gilligan imitates the sound of a handsaw being played. SKIPPER That's enough. PROFESSOR I'm afraid it's a fruitless task, Gilligan. Gilligan examines one last book title. GILLIGAN The only thing left is, "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare. PROFESSOR That's it! "Hamlet" is a marvelous play. SKIPPER But Hecuba puts on musicals. GILLIGAN We could put it to music. SKIPPER "Hamlet" to music? GILLIGAN Sure, we could call it "Hamlet A-Go-Go." Gilligan dances like a go-go dancer. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT The stage is set. The curtains are made from extra and discarded clothing. At the left of the stage a set of stairs leads to the ground. Nearby sits a makeshift record player with a crank, a captain's wheel for the turntable, and a horn to amplify the sound. On the turntable sits a 78 RPM record. Professor enters the stage through the break in the curtains. He bows deeply. PROFESSOR This is the story of a man who could not make up his mind. A tragic tale of love and hate, of remorse and revenge. But enough of me, the play's the thing. And with a roll of the drum and a blare of the trumpet, we present, "Hamlet." Professor walks off stage, down the stairs, to the record player. He places the needle down on the record and cranks the turntable. ZOOM TO RECORD PLAYER as it spins. MUSIC blares from the SPEAKER HORN. INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Harold Hecuba lies back in Mrs. Howell's bed. Harold Hecuba wears pajamas. He awakes to the sound of MUSIC in the distance. He adjusts his glasses and sits up. He listens to the music. EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT The curtains open. The stage is sparse. Only a stool and a stage door in the center of the back wall decorate the stage. Professor continues to crank the record player. MUSIC plays. Gilligan/Hamlet enters the stage through the stage door. He walks to the stool and places one foot on top of it. GILLIGAN/HAMLET "I ask to be or not to be. A rogue or peasant slave is what   you see. A boy who loves his mother’s knee, and so I ask to be or not to   be." INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Harold Hecuba pulls back the covers from his bed, grabs a cigar from a cup on the night stand, puts the cigar in his mouth, slides on his slippers, gets out of bed, stands, and puts on a robe. The robe is monogrammed "H.H." over the breast pocket. In the distance, he hears singing. GILLIGAN/HAMLET (O.S.) "So here’s my plea, I beg of you, and say you see a little hope for   me." EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Gilligan, dressed as Hamlet, rests one foot upon the stool. GILLIGAN/HAMLET "To fight or flee, to fight or   flee, I ask myself to be or not to be." Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell, as Claudius and Gertrude, enter from the stage wings. MR HOWELL/CLAUDIUS AND MRS HOWELL/GERTRUDE "He asks to be or not to be. A rogue and peasant slave is what   you see." MRS HOWELL/GERTRUDE "My son who loves his mother’s   knee ..." INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Harold Hecuba, cigar in mouth, wears robe and slippers.

CLEARING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell, as Claudius and Gertrude, continue to sing to their son, Hamlet. MR HOWELL/CLAUDIUS AND MRS HOWELL/GERTRUDE "Oh hear his plea, we beg of thee, and say we see, a little hope for   he." GILLIGAN/HAMLET "To fight or flee, to fight or   flee, I ask myself ..." ALL "... to be or not to be." Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell exit the stage. Gilligan/Hamlet removes his foot from the stool and moves to center stage. Gilligan/Hamlet cups his ear and leans toward the stage wings. GILLIGAN/HAMLET Hark! I do believe I hear the fair Ophelia. Ginger/Ophelia enters from the wings. GINGER/OPHELIA My Lord Hamlet is troubled. Ginger/Ophelia extends her hand to Gilligan/Hamlet. He briefly takes her hand and then releases it. He looks down. GILLIGAN/HAMLET Yeah, verily. My heart is heavy. (looking at Ginger/Ophelia) I cannot marry thee, Ophelia. GINGER/OPHELIA Oh! Ginger/Ophelia turns away from him. GILLIGAN/HAMLET There is nothing left for you but to get thee to a "notarary." Gilligan looks puzzled at the line. Ginger grimaces. Gilligan/Hamlet places one foot on the stool. GINGER/OPHELIA Ah, my poor Hamlet. Ah, my poor Hamlet. PROFESSOR cranks the record player GINGER/OPHELIA (cont'd) "Hamlet, dear, your problem is clear, avenging thy father’s death. You seek to harm, your uncle and mom ..." HAROLD HECUBA appears out of the jungle near the stage. He wears his monogrammed robe over his pajamas. Harold Hecuba follows the sound of the music and singing. GINGER/OPHELIA (O.S.) "... but you’re scaring me to   death. " BACK TO SCENE GINGER/OPHELIA "While I die and sigh and cry, that love is everything ..." HAROLD HECUBA watches from the edge of the jungle. GINGER/OPHELIA (O.S.) "... you’re content to try to   catch the conscience of a king." BACK TO SCENE GINGER/OPHELIA "Since the date ... " Ginger spreads her arm and her flowing sleeve obscures Gilligan's face. GILLIGAN/HAMLET sticks his head out from beneath Ophelia's flowing sleeve. BACK TO SCENE GINGER/OPHELIA (cont'd) "... when your dad met his fate, you just brood, and you don’t touch your food." HAROLD HECUBA watches from the edge of the jungle. GINGER/OPHELIA (O.S.) "You hate your ma, mad at my pa." BACK TO SCENE GINGER/OPHELIA "You’ll kill the king, or some silly thing. So Hamlet, Hamlet, ..." GILLIGAN/HAMLET AND GINGER/OPHELIA GINGER/OPHELIA (cont'd) "... do be a lamb, let rotten enough alone." PROFESSOR continues to crank the record player. GINGER/OPHELIA (O.S.) "From Ophelia, no one can steal ya, You’ll always be my own," BACK TO SCENE GINGER/OPHELIA "Leave the gravedigger’s scene, if you know what I mean. Danish pastry for two, for me, for you." Ginger/Ophelia smacks Gilligan/Hamlet with her forearm. Gilligan/Hamlet recoils backward before he regains his balance. His foot no longer rests on the stool. GILLIGAN/HAMLET In truth, Ophelia, you have said a mouthful. Ginger as Ophelia forgets her next line. GINGER/OPHELIA Oh. Uh -- PROFESSOR calls out Ginger's line. PROFESSOR Hamlet, I have so much more to offer. BACK TO SCENE GINGER/OPHELIA Hamlet, I have so much more to offer. But hark! Methinks me hear the heavy footsteps of my father, Polonius. GILLIGAN/HAMLET And the laughter of your brother and my friend, Laertes. GINGER/OPHELIA Oh, they must not find us here. But where to hide? GILLIGAN/HAMLET Hide anyplace, but don't go near the water. Ginger/Ophelia nods in agreement. They exit the stage through a stage wing. HAROLD HECUBA continues to watch from the jungle edge. BACK TO SCENE Mary Ann/Laertes and Skipper/Polonius enter the stage. MARY ANN/LAERTES Father, my ship sails at the tide. SKIPPER/POLONIUS A moment, my son, for I have something to tell you. MARY ANN/LAERTES I ask only for my allowance. SKIPPER/POLONIUS Ah, but I shall give you something far more valuable: advice. MARY ANN/LAERTES Do you know how much wine you can buy in Paris with advice? SKIPPER/POLONIUS Paris is a wild and wicked town. And you are but a young and innocent boy. MARY ANN/LAERTES (to audience) Oh, could I tell him a few stories. HAROLD HECUBA continues to watch the musical unfold. SKIPPER/POLONIUS (O.S.) Heed my words, Laertes ... BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER/POLONIUS ... and you will be safe. MARY ANN/LAERTES (aside) Unless I listen, I won't get my spending money, so I'll listen, I'll listen. SKIPPER/POLONIUS "Neither a borrower nor a lender   be. Do not forget: Stay out of debt. Think twice, and take this good   advice from me," HAROLD HECUBA watches from the jungle edge and shakes his head. SKIPPER/POLONIUS (O.S.) "Guard that old solvency." BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER/POLONIUS "There’s just one other thing you   ought to do. To thine own self be true." Mr. Howell/Claudius, Mrs. Howell/Gertrude, Gilligan/Hamlet, and Ginger/Ophelia join Skipper/Polonius, and Mary Ann/Laertes on stage. ALL "Neither a borrower nor a lender   be. Do not forget: Stay out of debt. Think twice, and take this good   advice from me: Guard that old solvency. There’s just one other thing you   ought to do, to thine own self be true." The MUSIC stops. HAROLD HECUBA makes himself known to the castaways and emerges from the jungle. HAROLD HECUBA Quiet! Harold Hecuba runs to the stairs and onto the stage. The castaways on stage talk with each other. HAROLD HECUBA (cont'd) I said quiet! How dare you put on a play without informing Harold Hecuba? From now on, H.H. is in full charge of all rehearsals. GINGER You mean you are going to produce our play? The sensational, great, magnificent Mister Hecuba? HAROLD HECUBA You left out stupendous. Watch that, baby. GINGER Sorry. HAROLD HECUBA All right, get ready to rehearse Harold Hecuba's "Hamlet." GILLIGAN Don't you mean, "William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'"? HAROLD HECUBA If he was alive today, I'd have him working on a full rewrite. Now look, first -- (claps) Wait a minute, take five. (re: robe and pajamas) The image is all wrong. I'll have to change clothes. Work on it! Work on it! Harold Hecuba exits the stage, leaving the castaways to discuss their good fortune. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT HAROLD HECUBA sits in his director's chair. Harold Hecuba wears a beret, aviator pants, mid-calf length boots, and a plaid sport coat. He rests his feet on a small table. He waves his director's cue to the beat of the MUSIC, as if to say "faster, more intense." ALL "... cy! There’s just one other thing you ought to do ..." HAMLET CAST sings on stage. ALL (cont'd) "... to thine own self be true." HAROLD HECUBA blows his whistle and slaps his director's cue against his leg to get the castaway casts' attention. HAROLD HECUBA Hold it! BACK TO SCENE Harold Hecuba rushes up onto the stage. HAROLD HECUBA (cont'd) In all the years I've been around, that is absolutely the worst. You call yourself actors? GILLIGAN I don't call myself an actor. HAROLD HECUBA Quiet! If I say you're an actor, you're an actor. GILLIGAN Okay, I'm an actor. HAROLD HECUBA Believe me, you are no actor. We're gonna take it from the top and we're gonna do it right. I'll show you how to do it with pace, tempo! Harold Hecuba strikes his director's cue against his leg for emphasis. Twice. HAROLD HECUBA (cont'd) Up to now, there's really been something rotten in Denmark. I want -- (turns to Gilligan) Silence! GILLIGAN I didn't say anything. HAROLD HECUBA If I know you, you will. Gilligan frowns. HAROLD HECUBA (cont'd) All right, turn in your costumes, from this point on, Hecuba will show you how to do this thing right. Harold Hecuba removes his jacket and looks at Gilligan. HAROLD HECUBA (cont'd) Cute. Gilligan and Ginger exchange glances and shrug. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT - LATER Professor stands near the record turntable. The other castaways sit in the audience for the Harold Hecuba production of "Hamlet." Harold Hecuba emerges between the stage curtains wearing his robe. The castaways applaud. HAROLD HECUBA You are about to be privileged to see an original production of "Hamlet" created by Harold Hecuba. Directed by Harold Hecuba. And now, for the first time, demonstrated to you by Harold Hecuba. MR HOWELL What a modest, unassuming chap. Harold Hecuba signals to the Professor to start the music. HAROLD HECUBA Overture. PROFESSOR cranks the record player to play the MUSIC. The music plays at a moderate tempo. BACK TO SCENE The curtains open. Harold Hecuba steps back through the stage door. The camera shakes to simulate a quick-change. CASTAWAYS sit in the audience and watch the Harold Hecuba production. BACK TO SCENE The camera shake stops and Harold Hecuba as Hamlet emerges from the stage door. HAROLD HECUBA/HAMLET "I ask myself to be or not to be." (directing) Hold it! Cut! It's dragging. It's laying right in the ground. PROFESSOR cranks the turntable faster. The tempo of the MUSIC increases. HAROLD HECUBA/HAMLET (O.S.) C'mon. Give me a little tempo. Faster! Faster! BACK TO SCENE HAROLD HECUBA/HAMLET "I ask to be or not to be. A rogue or peasant slave is what   you see. A boy who loves his mother’s knee, and so I ask to be or not to be." Harold Hecuba is impressed with himself and grunts pride and approval. HAROLD HECUBA/HAMLET (cont'd) Hark! I hear the fair Ophelia. Harold Hecuba/Hamlet exits through the stage door. The camera shakes during his quick-change from Hamlet to Ophelia. CASTAWAYS sit anxiously in the audience. BACK TO SCENE The camera shakes until Harold Hecuba's quick-change ends. Harold Hecuba emerges as Ophelia. HAROLD HECUBA/OPELIA (Ophelia's voice) "Hamlet, dear, your problem is   clear, avenging thy father’s death ... " PROFESSOR cranks the record player to keep the tempo up. HAROLD HECUBA/OPELIA (O.S.) (Ophelia's voice) "You seek to harm your uncle and   mom ... " BACK TO SCENE HAROLD HECUBA/OPELIA (Ophelia's voice) "... but you're scaring me to death." (Harold Hecuba's voice) Hark! Harold Hecuba/Ophelia realizes that he used the wrong voice for the character and tries again. HAROLD HECUBA/OPELIA (cont'd) (Ophelia's voice) Hark, it's my father, Polonius. Harold Hecuba/Ophelia exits through the stage door. The camera shakes for his quick change from Ophelia into Polonius. Harold Hecuba emerges from the stage door as Polonius. HAROLD HECUBA/POLONIUS "Neither a borrower nor a lender   be, do not forget: Stay out of debt." CASTAWAYS enjoy the musical. HAROLD HECUBA/POLONIUS (O.S.)

The camera shakes during his quick-change from Polonius to Claudius. He emerges from the stage door as Claudius. HAROLD HECUBA/CLAUDIUS As king of the realm -- Harold Hecuba collapses on the stage, exhausted. His glasses fall off. CASTAWAYS in the audience look on, but don't get up to help him. BACK TO SCENE Harold Hecuba lifts his head and puts his glasses back on. HAROLD HECUBA/POLONIUS Good night, sweet prince. Harold Hecuba puts his head back down onto the stage. CASTAWAYS applaud. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF BEACH EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan and Skipper walk across camp from the boys hut to the Howells hut looking for Harold Hecuba. SKIPPER Stop that and make sense, will you? GILLIGAN He's gone, gone. Mister Hecuba's gone. SKIPPER But that's impossible. GILLIGAN I knocked on his door and nobody answered. SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan. Well, he might be sound asleep. After all, he gave quite a performance last night. GILLIGAN Yeah. SKIPPER I'll see. Skipper knocks on the door frame. SKIPPER (cont'd) Mister Hecuba? Mister Hecuba, are you awake? Skipper opens the door and peeks in. INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY - CONTINUOUS Skipper opens the door further and peers into the Howell/Hecuba hut. Skipper looks around and enters. Gilligan follows him in. SKIPPER Mister Hecuba? Gilligan notices a note lying on Mrs. Howell's bed. GILLIGAN Skipper, there's a note. Skipper picks up the note and reads it aloud. SKIPPER "Friends, the rescue boat came during the night and I didn't want to disturb your sleep." GILLIGAN (irritated) " -- didn't want to disturb your sleep"? SKIPPER Will you keep quiet? Skipper continues reading the note. SKIPPER (cont'd) "Good luck and keep well. Cordially, Harold Hecuba, Harold Hecuba Productions." GILLIGAN He left us. He left us behind! Professor enters quietly behind them carrying the radio. SKIPPER Oh, but I'm sure he'll be coming back. I mean, he has no reason for leaving us. PROFESSOR Oh, yes he has. Listen to this reason. Professor turns on the radio. RADIO ANNOUNCER And now a repeat of the marvelous news. Harold Hecuba has been rescued and with a bigger and better future. He announced that his next production will be a musical version of "Hamlet," the greatest idea he ever had. Who but Harold Hecuba could think of an idea as brilliant as that? GILLIGAN Us, that's who. Gilligan walks over to the Howell's dresser. SKIPPER But, I can't believe that he'd leave us here. Gilligan picks up the newspaper lying on the dresser. PROFESSOR Well, he has. Gilligan sits down on the dresser and reads the newspaper. He adjusts his hat so it sits on his head to one side, like a fedora. SKIPPER But how could he do a thing like that? I mean, just because he made a movie he's gonna leave us? Gilligan opens the newspaper to reveal the newspaper is "Show Biz." SKIPPER (cont'd) I mean he's gonna desert us because of a movie he made with -- Skipper notices Gilligan sitting on the dresser and reading the newspaper. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, what's the matter with you? Why aren't you upset? GILLIGAN Well, that's show biz. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: INT.

Gilligan sings even more quietly. GILLIGAN (quietly) "I ask to be or not to be. That is the question that I ask of   me." SKIPPER (angrily) Gilligan, cut that out! GILLIGAN (whispers) "I ask to be or not to be. That is the question that I ask -- " Skipper pulls down the edge of Gilligan's hammock, causing the hammock to flip. Gilligan tumbles to the ground.

MINNOW - AFT DECK - DAY The Professor moves from the port side to the starboard side of the deck. He throws a rope ladder over the side. EXT. S.S. MINNOW - DAY Gilligan helps MR. THURSTON HOWELL III, a multi-millionaire, and EUNICE (LOVEY) WENTWORTH HOWELL, his socially prominent wife, climb down a ladder placed against the S.S. Minnow's hull. The Howells move away from the ladder toward the bow. MRS HOWELL Thank you, steward. MR HOWELL I wonder if tipping would be in bad taste? The Howells walk to the bow of the S.S. Minnow. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Bunny, Professor, and Ginger gather near the stern of the S.S. Minnow. The passengers are grateful that the Skipper got them them to dry land. PROFESSOR Skipper, there was a time back there when I thought my boys in my science class were going to have a new teacher next term. GINGER I want to thank you too, Skipper. I was sure I was gonna end up as a hunk of shish-kabob on a swordfish. BUNNY I'm especially glad that I didn't drown, Skipper, because I don't even know how to swim. Skipper pauses at Bunny's statement. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY The Howells make their way from the bow on the port side of the S. S. Minnow to the stern. The Skipper meets them mid-boat. MR HOWELL Oh, Captain. Would you have your man remove our luggage from this vessel? SKIPPER I'd be very happy to, Mister Howell. Where would you have it removed to? MR HOWELL Oh, someplace where the limousine can pick it up and take us to the nearest hotel. SKIPPER I don't even know where we are. For all I know, this island is uninhabited. MR HOWELL Oh, nonsense. Mister Hilton has hotels everywhere. MRS HOWELL Quite right, Thurston, dear. SKIPPER That storm drove us hundreds of miles off course. This island doesn't even appear on my Navy charts. MR HOWELL Well, you should have gotten your charts from a more reliable source. SKIPPER There is no more reliable source than the United States Navy! MR HOWELL Well, yes there is. The Sunnybrook Yacht Club. (salutes) My outfit. Stunned at Mr. Howell's gall, Skipper turns away. MR HOWELL (CONT'D) Come along, Lovey. Mr. Howell offers his arm to Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL You know, I think someone ought to report him. MR HOWELL Well, he will bear watching. The Howells stroll away toward the S.S. Minnow's bow. Skipper turns and heads toward the stern, where Bunny, Professor, and Ginger stand. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Skipper reveals his plan to the other passengers who are gathered near the S.S. Minnow's stern. SKIPPER Now hear this. I want all you passengers to stay right here by the boat and out of danger. Gilligan and I will explore the island. (to Gilligan) Gilligan! EXT. S.S. MINNOW - AFT DECK - DAY Gilligan stands tall. He wears binoculars and a spyglass around his neck, has rope draped over his shoulder, carries a canteen, knife, and small bag attached to his belt. GILLIGAN I got the equipment right here, sir. I knew you were going to need it. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY SKIPPER Good work! Let's get started. EXT. S.S. MINNOW AFT DECK - DAY GILLIGAN Yes, sir! Gilligan salutes and stomps his feet together. Gilligan falls through the deck to the hold of the S.S. Minnow and disappears EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY The Skipper, Bunny, Professor, and Ginger run over to the gaping hole in the starboard side of the S.S. Minnow. INT./EXT. S.S.

Gilligan salutes and smiles uncomfortably. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY Gilligan and the Skipper walk through the jungle and stop at a coconut tree. The Skipper looks up at the tree. SKIPPER There's exactly what I've been looking for. GILLIGAN It's a coconut tree. We've passed a thousand of them. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. SKIPPER Not like this one. TWO TALL COCONUT TREES SKIPPER (O.S.) This has got to be the tallest tree on the island. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER Now, from the top of this tree, it'll be possible to see the whole island. Then we'll know whether it is uninhabited or not. GILLIGAN That's a great idea, Skipper. But who's gonna climb up there and look around? I mean, there's only two of us here. And you can't do it because you're the Skipper. And I can't do it because I don't know how to climb a coconut tree. Skipper sternly stares at Gilligan. Gilligan looks up at the tall coconut tree. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Besides, I'm afraid of heights. Skipper sternly stares at Gilligan. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I'm not starting any mutiny, Skipper, but I'm not climbing up that tree. No siree. Not me. FLIP TO: EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY Gilligan sits atop the coconut tree and shields his eyes. TWO TALL COCONUT TREES SKIPPER (O.S.) What do you see? BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN Nothing! I've got my eyes closed! EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY From the base of the tree, Skipper encourages Gilligan. SKIPPER There's nothing to be afraid of! (emphatically) Look around! EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY Gilligan uncovers his eyes. GILLIGAN Hey, you were right, Skipper! I can see ... GILLIGAN'S ARM Gilligan moves and dislodges a coconut. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN (cont'd) ... the whole island from up here. EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY As Skipper stands next to the coconut tree, a coconut falls and hits him on the head. EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY GILLIGAN Look out below! EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY SKIPPER Thanks for the warning! EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY Gilligan uses binoculars to scan the area. He notices something and pauses. GILLIGAN Hey, I see something. (pause) I see some people. EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY SKIPPER Is it a village? EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY GILLIGAN It's just some people. But they have a boat, Skipper. They can get us off here. Skipper, we're saved! EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY Skipper looks up toward the top of the coconut tree. EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY Gilligan quickly climbs down the coconut tree, dislodging many coconuts. CAMERA MOVES WITH Gilligan as he rapidly descends from the top of the coconut tree to the base where Skipper stands. EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY Gilligan lands on the Skipper followed by the coconuts raining down. Gilligan gets to his feet and tries to help the Skipper up, but Skipper's weight overwhelms Gilligan. Gilligan tumbles over the Skipper. Another coconut falls on the Skipper. Skipper rises to his feet. And another coconut falls on him. Skipper helps Gilligan to his feet. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Skipper. I'm just so anxious. SKIPPER Never mind that. Are you -- Another coconut falls and hits the Skipper. SKIPPER (cont'd) Are you sure you saw some people? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. And a boat too. Skipper, we're saved! Just follow me. I know exactly where it is. Gilligan turns and exits. Skipper follows him. EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY Gilligan leads the Skipper through the jungle. GILLIGAN Right this way, Skipper. I'm blazing the ol' trail. Gilligan pushes a palm frond out of his way, but it snaps back and hits the Skipper, knocking him to the ground. Gilligan runs along the path and stops to encourage the Skipper. GILLIGAN (cont'd) We're saved. We're saved. C'mon, Skipper! C'mon. Gilligan turns and runs toward the beach. EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY GILLIGAN Here's the beach. Wait until we tell the passengers the good news! Skipper catches up with Gilligan, but Gilligan is too eager to wait for the Skipper to catch his breath so he continues running toward the people. Skipper picks up the pace and runs after him. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY GILLIGAN Whoo! Yippee! Look, Skipper, look. Oh, yippee! Yeah! Yippee! Yahoo! Skipper looks toward the boat. Gilligan notices Skipper's lack of enthusiasm. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hurray!

ISLAND BEACH - DAY Gilligan looks sheepish as he realizes that the people he saw were the S.S. Minnow's passengers. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY RADIO RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The sea and air search for the S.S. Minnow has proven unsuccessful. BACK TO SCENE The Skipper, Professor, Ginger, Bunny, and the Howells listen to the radio detail the search for their boat. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) The small boat which usually ferries tourists among nearby islands, must have been sunk in the recent storm and the Coast Guard is abandoning the search. And now the latest from Wall Street. Today, the Dow Jones averages climbed to a new high. The Professor turns off the radio. Mr. Howell gets up and rushes over to the radio. MR HOWELL Don't turn that off! That's the best part. Mr. Howell grabs the radio and turns it back on. MR HOWELL (cont'd) (disgusted) Really. Mr. Howell returns to his seat with the radio. The Professor, Skipper, Ginger, and Bunny sit near a small table. The transmitter sits on the table. SKIPPER Here we are on a desert island, uninhabited, unexplored, uncharted. GINGER I get the picture. Just color us lost. SKIPPER Well, our only chance of rescue is if the Professor here can get the transmitter fixed. Then we can radio for help. PROFESSOR (frustrated) I've been trying, but it's very difficult without the proper tools. TRANSMITTER The Professor fiddles with the transmitter. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER Now hear this, folks. We've all got enough to keep us busy. The Professor here, he's fixing the transmitter. EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY Gilligan fishes in the ocean from the edge of the water with a fishing rod and reel. SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan is out there right now, fishing for our dinner. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Skipper assigns tasks to the passengers. SKIPPER (to the girls) And you girls, you girls wash all of the dirty clothes on board. BUNNY Aye, aye, Skipper. Bunny gets up and Ginger follows her. Skipper walks over to the Howells. The Howells sit in their directors' chairs. Mr. Howell holds the radio close to his ear and listens to the radio. SKIPPER Mister Howell? MR HOWELL Quiet, please. SKIPPER Uh, Mister Howell, please. Just above the beach in that group of palms is a fresh water spring. MR HOWELL And? The Skipper reaches up and removes a bucket from the S.S. Minnow's deck. SKIPPER And here's a bucket. MR HOWELL My dear Captain, you don't quite understand. SKIPPER Understand? What? MR HOWELL Well, I'm retired. MRS HOWELL Of course you are, dear. MR HOWELL Well, I haven't worked since -- well, let me see now -- Lovey, when was the last time I worked? MRS HOWELL Darling, you never have. MR HOWELL Of course. Dear old dad left me everything! Mr. Howell rises to leave. MR HOWELL (cont'd) C'mon, Lovey. Industrials are up. Mr. Howell hands the radio to Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL Ooh. Mrs. Howell hands the radio to the Skipper. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Here you are. SKIPPER Never mind. I'll get the water myself. MRS HOWELL Oh, uh, Captain? Something very important. SKIPPER How's that? MRS HOWELL We always have dinner at eight. MR HOWELL Cocktails first. The Skipper scowls at the gall of the Howells, places the radio on the Professor's work table, and steadies himself on the table. Skipper shakes off his disgust and carries the bucket away. EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY As ordered, Gilligan fishes for dinner near the water's edge. PROFESSOR (O.S.) Test, one, two, three, four. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY The Professor works on the transmitter and radio and speaks into the microphone. PROFESSOR Test, one, two, three, four. The Professor's words ECHO on the RADIO. PROFESSOR (cont'd) One, two. The Professor hears an ECHO of his voice over the radio, the Professor excitedly confirms his findings and picks up the radio and listens to it. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Test, one, two, three, four! The Professor puts down the radio. PROFESSOR (cont'd) (to himself) It works. I fixed it. (to Skipper) Skipper! Skipper! The transmitter works! EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY Gilligan continues to fish for dinner. PROFESSOR (O.S.) I fixed it! SKIPPER (O.S.) Great. Wonderful! EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY The Professor excitedly leaves his work table and rushes to the Skipper. Gilligan's fishing hook snags the transmitter and pulls the transmitter off the Professor's work table. PROFESSOR I found the break in the printed circuit and I fixed it. Now it works. Come on. The Professor returns to his work table with the Skipper and discovers the transmitter is missing. PROFESSOR (cont'd) (puzzled) Well, the transmitter was right here right next to the radio. The Professor picks up the empty transmitter case. PROFESSOR (cont'd) This is just the case. The Professor tosses the empty transmitter case to the ground behind him. SKIPPER You mean right here? PROFESSOR Yes, and I know I fixed it. I heard myself on the radio. EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY Gilligan continues to fish for dinner. SKIPPER (O.S.) Well, now come on, Professor. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Skipper picks up the radio from the table. The Skipper disbelieves the Professor's story. SKIPPER If it was right here with the radio, how could it vanish? RADIO Gilligan's fishing hook snags the radio and pulls it out of Skipper's hands. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER (cont'd) Now I know how it could vanish. The Skipper and Professor chase the radio across the sand as it is pulled by Gilligan toward the water. Professor gives up the chase before he reaches the water's edge. Professor places his face in his palm. EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY The Skipper plunges into the water and submerges quickly. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. Goin' in for a dip? Skipper replaces his completely soaked cap on his head. Skipper yells to the ocean. SKIPPER Now hear this! If there be a man-eating shark out there -- (points to Gilligan) What are you waiting for? Gilligan looks hurt by Skipper's words. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. ISLAND BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT JUNGLE EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT The Skipper tends to a small campfire. Skipper hears a noise in the nearby jungle and rises. The Skipper carries a revolver. SKIPPER Who goes there? Gilligan approaches the Skipper from behind and touches him on the shoulder. GILLIGAN Skipper? Startled, the Skipper fires the revolver toward the jungle. SKIPPER Ugh! Gilligan! (motioning to revolver) That was our last bullet. GILLIGAN Skipper? Skipper? Let me stand guard for a while. You've been up half the night. I want to help. You must be exhausted. Someone has to relieve you. SKIPPER Maybe you're right. Go get the Professor. Ask him to come over here. Maybe he can stand watch for a while. GILLIGAN But the Professor is only a passenger. I'm your very own crew. SKIPPER Do you have to remind me of that? GILLIGAN I know this mess we're in is all my fault. I mean, I'm the one who lost the anchor. And I'm the one who lost the radio. And I'm the one who lost the transmitter. And without the transmitter, we're marooned on this island. I tell you what, Skipper. SKIPPER What? GILLIGAN You don't have to pay me for this week's work. Skipper buries his frustration with Gilligan. SKIPPER Do you really know the fix we're in? Gilligan shakes his head. SKIPPER (cont'd) There may be wild animals out there waiting to chew us to bits. We may be attacked by savages from nearby islands. Cannibals! As he speaks, Skipper turns and picks up the revolver. SKIPPER (cont'd) And now, thanks to you, we don't even have a weapon to defend ourselves. GILLIGAN Skipper? I saved some good news for last. SKIPPER With you around, there's no such thing as good news. GILLIGAN I saved a box of cartridges, Skipper, for the revolver. Skipper is pleased and he hints at a smile. SKIPPER Bullets for the gun? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. I kept them dry all through the storm and everything. SKIPPER Good work, Gilligan. Give them to me and I'll load the pistol. THEIR FEET AND CAMPFIRE Gilligan hands the Skipper the box of bullets. They slip out of the Skipper's hands and fall into the fire. BACK TO SCENE Skipper glances at Gilligan. Gilligan glances back at Skipper. He slowly looks down at the campfire and wonders what happens to bullets in a fire. THEIR FEET AND CAMPFIRE The BULLETS FIRE in random directions. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan and the Skipper scramble away from the campfire as the BULLETS FIRE. They exit into the jungle. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY The Professor carries palm leaves up the beach and drops them in front of the under-construction shelter. The Professor and the Skipper work to build a shelter. The Skipper hands a stake to the Professor. SKIPPER Hold this for me, would you? The Professor crouches down to hold the stake. The Skipper uses a mallet to hammer the stake into the soil. PROFESSOR Skipper, how long do you really think we'll be on this island? SKIPPER Well, Professor, with that transmitter on the bottom of the ocean, we're stuck here. That is, unless we're spotted by a plane or a ship. PROFESSOR It could be days, weeks, or even months. No wonder you insisted on building this shelter. SKIPPER Correction, Professor. Three shelters. A "his" for the boys, a "hers" for the girls, and a "theirs" for the Howells. Skipper laughs. Professor gets up from his crouched position. PROFESSOR I better go get some more palm leaves. SKIPPER Good idea. Gilligan walks up and offers to help Skipper. GILLIGAN Skipper, can I help you? SKIPPER No, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Please? SKIPPER You're just plain ol' bad luck to me. Skipper stops hammering the stake. SKIPPER (cont'd) You remember that time on the destroyer when that depth charge broke loose? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. It was rolling across the deck and I pulled you out of the way. I saved your life. SKIPPER Well, not exactly. You didn't save it, you just prolonged it so you'd give me more bad luck. Now, will you run along? I've got a lot of work to do. Gilligan salutes Skipper. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. Skipper, frustrated but knowing that as a leader he must set an example and follow the rules, returns Gilligan's salute. As Gilligan walks away the Skipper puts down his mallet on his foot. SKIPPER (pained) Oh! Gilligan looks back at the Skipper. SKIPPER (cont'd) Shove off, Gilligan! Gilligan turns and runs from the Skipper. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY The Professor cuts palm leaves. Gilligan approaches him. GILLIGAN Professor, can I help you? PROFESSOR Gilligan, it is incorrect English to say "Can I help you?" You should say "May I help you?" GILLIGAN Professor, may I help you? PROFESSOR No. Gilligan begins to leave, but turns to ask to help a second time. PROFESSOR (cont'd) No. Gilligan, disappointed that he isn't allowed to help, exits. As he leaves, he moves a large palm leaf out of his way. The palm leaf springs back into position, hitting the Professor's face. The Professor moves it out of the way. EXT. LAGOON - DAY As ordered by the Skipper, the girls wash clothes in the lagoon. BUNNY Isn't it fun, being cast away on a desert island? GINGER Oh, yeah. Loads of laughs. Robinson Crusoe enjoyed it for nine years. Gilligan, smiling, runs up to the girls. GILLIGAN Hi, girls. Can I help? I'm very good at washing. GINGER I'm very good at wishing. And I wish you'd get lost. Dejected, his face turns from a smile to hurt. Gilligan gets up and exits. BUNNY Ginger, I'm surprised at you. Why are you so mean to him? GINGER Bunny, it's Gilligan's fault we're stuck on this stupid island. BUNNY But after all, he is a human being. GINGER I'll bet he isn't, and I'll give you six points. Bunny leaves the lagoon and chases after Gilligan. BUNNY Gilligan! Gilligan! EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY Gilligan walks over the to the edge of the beach, where the jungle vegetation begins, and sits down on a rock. BUNNY (O.S.) Gilligan! Gilligan! Bunny runs to where Gilligan is seated. GILLIGAN You better keep away from me. I'm nothing but plain ol' bad luck. BUNNY You mustn't talk that way. Gilligan removes his hat. GILLIGAN Every time I try to help, something goes wrong. You know what I thought of doing before? Packing my things and clearing out. BUNNY Oh, I'm glad you didn't. GILLIGAN I couldn't. There's no place to clear out to. EXT. LAGOON - DAY Ginger is frustrated as she tries to wash the castaways' laundry in the lagoon. Ginger looks skyward as she talks to herself. GINGER I wish I had some suds. I'd even settle for "brand ecks." Ginger throws the laundry down in a pile. EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY Bunny tries to console Gilligan. BUNNY I've got to go help Ginger with the washing. Now, you go catch some big fish. GILLIGAN Now, I don't think I can -- BUNNY Now, those are orders. Bunny kisses her index finger and touches it to Gilligan's nose. Gilligan looks down the bridge of his nose, touches it, and smiles. Gilligan puts his hat on. FLIP TO: EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY SERIES OF SHOTS Gilligan fishes at the edge of the ocean. Gilligan pulls back his fishing rod. A large fish, perhaps a marlin, jumps out of the water as it swims. Gilligan struggles with the fishing rod. Gilligan backs up the beach. Gilligan marches up the beach with the fishing rod over his shoulder. Gilligan turns around and faces the ocean. The marlin pulls on the line and Gilligan is pulled face-down onto the sand. The marlin jumps out of the water as it swims. The marlin drags Gilligan down the beach into the water. The marlin jumps out of the water as it swims. Gilligan is toppled and the marlin drags him to the water's edge. A wave crashes over Gilligan, but he remains determined to land the marlin. EXT. S.S. MINNOW BOW DECK - DAY Mrs. Howell sits with Mr. Howell on the bow deck of the S.S. Minnow. Mrs. Howell sees Gilligan fishing on the beach. MRS HOWELL Darling, look at that. MR HOWELL Why, it's Gilligan! EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY SERIES OF SHOTS Gilligan pulls the marlin to shore. Gilligan struggles with his fishing rod and the marlin on the hook. He pulls the fishing line up the beach and sits on the sand. The marlin struggles in the water. The fishing line drags Gilligan to his feet and back to the water. The fishing line pulls Gilligan face-first toward the water. At the water's edge, Gilligan stands up, turns around, and pulls the fishing line up the beach. EXT. S.S. MINNOW BOW DECK - DAY Mrs. Howell sits with Mr. Howell on the bow deck of the S.S. Minnow. Mr. Howell raises his binoculars to get a better look at Gilligan's efforts to land the marlin. EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY SERIES OF SHOTS Gilligan again pulls the line with the marlin and struggles up the beach. The marlin regains the upper hand and drags Gilligan back into the water. Waves crash over Gilligan. Another wave crashes over Gilligan as he gets up. Determined, Gilligan confidently puts the fishing pole under his arm and marches out of the water onto the beach. The marlin is pulled into the shallow beach water by Gilligan. Gilligan continues marching up to the beach. Gilligan reels in the marlin almost to his feet, but it is a shark, not a marlin! Gilligan beaches the shark. Gilligan wrestles the shark and subdues it. EXT. S.S. MINNOW BOW DECK - DAY Mrs. Howell sits with Mr. Howell on the bow deck of the S.S. Minnow. MR HOWELL At a time like this, water sports! (disgusted) I mean, really! EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY Exhausted, Gilligan drags the shark by the tail out of the water onto the beach. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY FISHING - MONTAGE Gilligan reels in fish. EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY Gilligan carries a big fish and adds it to a large pile of big fish he's caught. Gilligan rearranges the fish when a FISH begins to emit the sound of a RADIO BROADCAST. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) And now it's time for your ... OPEN-MOUTHED FISH TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) ... daily exercise again. Open the windows, take a deep breath ... BACK TO SCENE Gilligan looks around to locate the source of the voice. He points one ear toward the ground. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) ... and let good ol' Tropical Tom help you stay in shape. First, let's try the simple knee bend. OPEN-MOUTHED FISH TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) Hands on hips now. Bend at the knees and here we go. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan cocks his head and steps around the fish and tries to determine which fish is "speaking." TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Up, down, three, four. Up, down, three, four. OPEN-MOUTHED FISH TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) C'mon, you! Let's get with it. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN Me? TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) I mean you, yes. Gilligan begins knee bends according to Tropical Tom's instructions. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) Up we go, down we go. Up we go, down we go. Up, down, up, down. Gilligan discontinues his knee bends and resumes searching for the sound. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) Up, down, up, down. Gilligan finds a candidate fish and grabs it out of the large pile of fish. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) Up, down, up, down. That's enough now. Relax. Gilligan drops the fish. When the fish lands, the RADIO program changes to MARCHING BAND MUSIC. Startled, Gilligan picks up the fish again. GILLIGAN The radio. The fish must have swallowed the radio. Gilligan strikes the side of the fish and the RADIO program changes to a BASEBALL GAME. BASEBALL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And Mantle hit a bunt single and caught the infield landing. They were expecting him to hit away. This puts men on first and third with one out, with Roger Meris coming up to bat. GILLIGAN Come on, Roger. Get a hit. The fish stops emitting sound of the radio, so Gilligan strikes the side of the fish again. The RADIO program changes back to MARCHING BAND MUSIC. GILLIGAN (cont'd) The radio. I've got to tell them I caught the radio. Gilligan hoists the fish containing the radio over his shoulder and exits. INT./EXT. SHELTER - DAY Bunny, Ginger, Professor, and Skipper work on the inside of the shelter. Skipper hears the MARCHING BAND MUSIC and runs to the shelter's window. Gilligan runs up to the shelter and comes to the open window on the outside. GILLIGAN I've got it! I've got it! We're saved! SKIPPER (laughing) Well, I'll be. PROFESSOR The fish must have swallowed the radio. Bunny excitedly hugs Gilligan. BUNNY You did it, Gilligan! You saved us! GILLIGAN And if that fish swallowed the radio, maybe another fish swallowed the transmitter. BUNNY (excitedly) Eek! SKIPPER What do you think our chances are, Professor? Gilligan leaves the window, walks around the shelter, and joins the others inside the shelter. PROFESSOR Well, considering the size of that lagoon, and the number of fish large enough to swallow a transmitter, the odds on catching one, after we've already caught one that swallowed the radio -- I'd estimate those odds to be roughly a million to one. SKIPPER Well, that's good enough for me! Come on, get to work. Skipper hands the fish with the radio to the Professor. Skipper, Ginger, and Bunny exit the shelter. The Professor lays the fish on the table, takes a knife, and begins to gut the fish. EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY Ginger, Bunny, Skipper, and Gilligan rush to Gilligan's pile of fish. SKIPPER Now, everybody grab a fish and start feeling for that transmitter. INT. SHELTER - DAY The Professor cleans off the radio with a cloth. PROFESSOR Skipper! Skipper, wait. EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY Still holding the radio, the Professor runs to Gilligan's pile of fish where the other castaways are gathered. PROFESSOR Skipper, Skipper, wait a minute. Wait. Wait. There's an easier way to do it. Now I've just tuned this radio to the same wavelength as the transmitter. Now, if you just say a few words into the fish, I'll be able to hear you on the radio. SKIPPER (to Gilligan) Well, you heard what the man said. Don't just stand there, Gilligan, say something in a fish! Gilligan picks up a small fish from the pile of fish. GILLIGAN I don't know what to say. I've never talked to a fish before. The Professor listens to the radio. PROFESSOR Say anything. GILLIGAN Hello there, fish. PROFESSOR Louder. GILLIGAN Hello there, louder. Skipper picks up a bigger fish and speaks into it. SKIPPER Now hear this. Now hear this. At north by northeast -- Ginger speaks into a fish. The Professor listens to the radio, but doesn't hear any sound. GINGER Please get me off this island, fish. Bunny speaks into a fish. BUNNY "Shoot, if you must, this old gray head. But spare my country's flag, she said." The Howells enter and walk up behind the other castaways. The Howells appear positively puzzled at the odd behavior of the other castaways. Mr. Howell glances at Mrs. Howell. Mrs. Howell looks on curiously. SKIPPER Now hear this. Now hear this -- GINGER Please get me off this island, fish! The castaways all speak at the same time into their fish. MRS HOWELL Thurston, they've all gone mad! Skipper brings a fish to the Howells. SKIPPER Mister Howell, you've just come out of retirement. I want you to grab a fish and say something into it. MR HOWELL Now just one moment -- SKIPPER Those are orders! Mister Howell, grab a fish (swings fish to Mr. Howell) and say something into it. (to Mrs. Howell) You too, Missus Howell. MR HOWELL You heard the Captain, Lovey. Mr. Howell passes the fish to Mrs. Howell. Mrs. Howell holds the fish. The other castaways continue speaking into their respective fish and the Professor listens to the radio. MRS HOWELL Maybe we'd better humor them. MR HOWELL Yes, yes. Mrs. Howell holds the fish while Mr. Howell speaks into it. MR HOWELL (cont'd) May I have long distance, please? Mr. Howell nods at Mrs. Howell. Mrs. Howell nods back. The castaways continue to all speak into their fish at the same time. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY RADIO RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... and all hope for the missing charter boat S.S. Minnow has now been abandoned. BACK TO SCENE The castaways lounge near the ocean beach and enjoy the day. The Howells sit in their directors' chairs. PROFESSOR Without that transmitter, we could be here for a very long time. Gilligan sits up. GILLIGAN Hey, I know how we can be saved. SKIPPER Gilligan, I don't want to hear it. An airplane's ENGINE DRONES above them. GILLIGAN Okay, I won't tell you about the plane up there. SKIPPER Plane? The castaways jump to their feet. BUNNY A plane! A plane! A real live plane! The castaways look to the sky.

Episode #17, “Little Island, Big Gun” A bank robber comes to the island to hide from the authorities and holds the castaways prisoner while he waits for his boat after his cover is blown.  “Little Island, Big Gun”  By  Dick Conway  and  Roland MacLane  January 23, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON - NIGHT Under the cover of darkness, Farrell and his accomplice Gates pilot a small boat with an outboard motor into the lagoon. The motor is cut and the men use oars to paddle their way on to shore quietly. Once ashore, Farrell steps onto the shore. Gates removes Jackson's provisions from the boat. Jackson ventures into the jungle followed by Gates. Both men are in suits and wear hats. They look remarkably like gangsters. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT Farrell makes his way into the jungle. Gates carries Farrell's provisions. GATES What a haul, boss. Half a million bucks! Farrell steps over a fallen tree trunk. FARRELL I'm well aware of the contents, Gates. Gates puts the provisions down. GATES Boy, you sure know how to pick a hideout, boss. Why, this little old island ain't even on the maps. FARRELL Precisely. Uncharted, uninhabited. A perfect place to relax while the police conduct their investigation. Gates pats Farrell on the back. GATES I'll be back for you real soon, boss. FARRELL You boys take the Sea Spray back into the regular shipping lanes as soon as possible so the Coast Guard will spot you. GATES Huh? FARRELL Now, once the Sea Spray has been boarded and searched you come back here, pick me up, and we go to South America. GATES I gotta hand it to you, boss. Now, look, you got everything? FARRELL Well, let's see. Foodstuffs, cooking utensils, bedroll, a large deposit from the Monarch Bank, and a good friend. Farrell opens his suit coat to reveal a gun. GATES You got everything. I'll see you, boss. Gates pats Farrell on the back again, turns, and walks through the jungle underbrush. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. ISLAND BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper, Gilligan, and Professor emerge from the jungle into the camp clearing. Skipper calls out to the girls. SKIPPER Ladies, what's for breakfast? Gilligan, Skipper, and Professor sit down at the community table. Mary Ann emerges from the girls hut with a tray of food. MARY ANN Take a wild guess and try coconut. The men groan. SKIPPER Well, never mind, just dig in. Ginger emerges from the girls hut too. GILLIGAN But, Skipper, it's always coconut. Sliced coconut, diced coconut, baked coconut, fried coconut -- coconut on coconut, coconut stuff -- GINGER We're gonna have a treat for Thanksgiving dinner. GILLIGAN What's that? GINGER Coconut drumsticks. Gilligan puts his head down on the table in disappointment. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Farrell fries bacon in a frying pan. With a fork, he holds a piece of partially cooked bacon near his face to smell it. EXT. CAMP - DAY As the men sit and eat their coconut meals, Gilligan sniffs the air. Gilligan pauses. GILLIGAN I smell bacon. SKIPPER Sure you do, Gilligan. Skipper scoffs. Skipper leans over to the Professor. The Professor also leans in. Skipper gives an aside glance. SKIPPER (cont'd) I think Gilligan's been on the island too long. Gilligan gives Skipper a dirty look. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Farrell enjoys the aroma of the bacon on his fork. He looks at the bacon and provides a hint of a smile. EXT. CAMP - DAY The men sit at the table and eat coconut from their plates. PROFESSOR You know, I thought I smelled bacon, too. GILLIGAN (to Skipper) See? Yet the Professor dismisses the idea completely. PROFESSOR Yeah. Unfortunately, it's just a figment of our imagination. GILLIGAN Yeah? Well, my figment smells just the way I like it. Well-done and crisp. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan searches the jungle for date trees. He holds a bow and arrow. His quiver is strapped over his shoulder. Today his prey are the dates that grow high in the trees. SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan! GILLIGAN Over here, Skipper. Skipper emerges from the jungle growth. SKIPPER Listen, little buddy, if we want to eat something beside coconuts every day, we're gonna have to hustle up some other kind of food. GILLIGAN I'm all set. I'm gonna pick some dates. SKIPPER With a bow and arrow? GILLIGAN Well, it's a cinch we can't climb these trees, so I figure I'll just shoot them down. SKIPPER Well, certainly, Gilligan. If you're real careful -- maybe you can shoot the pits out of them at the same time. GILLIGAN I bet it works. Watch. SKIPPER Gilligan, you've pulled some pretty funny stunts on this island since we've been here, but -- Gilligan shots the arrow high into the tree above them. Dates rain down. GILLIGAN Ooh ooh ow ow, it worked. It worked, Skipper! Look, Skipper! Look at them all! Dates and dates and dates and dates! SKIPPER Little buddy, you did it! GILLIGAN Yeah. SKIPPER Okay, I'll gather these up and take them back to camp. You go out and hunt some more. GILLIGAN But Skipper, I shot them down, so I ought to take them back to camp. SKIPPER Gilligan. GILLIGAN Like I was saying, I shot them down, so you ought to take them back. SKIPPER Exactly. GILLIGAN See you later. Gilligan leaves the Skipper to pick up the dates. He ventures further into the jungle. WIPE TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Farrell sits on his suitcase and counts the bills from the stolen loot. He hears some foliage rustling and stops counting. He picks up the bag of loot, stuffs the money back inside, and rises to his feet. In the distance, Gilligan hunts for dates. Farrell finds a small bare tree, reaches up, and puts the bag of money between two branches of the tree. Gilligan inserts an arrow onto his bow and spies dates in a tree. Farrell removes his gun and points it at Gilligan. Gilligan crouches down to steady himself and takes aim. Farrell turns around to look to Gilligan's target. Gilligan shoots his arrow. Another direct hit! Dates rain down on Farrell. Farrell puts his gun away. Gilligan walks over to the base of the date tree. GILLIGAN I did it. I got a hit, a direct hit! Oh, boy, oh boy! Look at them all! A big hit! Look! Look! Look! Gilligan notices Farrell, is startled and his excitement ends. GILLIGAN (cont'd) What are you doing here? FARRELL Me? I was just about to ask you the same thing. GILLIGAN I was shipwrecked. FARRELL Amazing. That's just what happened to me. Shipwrecked. Barely made it to shore. GILLIGAN I'm sure glad you made it. But if you were shipwrecked how come your clothes are not even wrinkled? Gilligan reaches out to touch Farrell's suit's label. Farrell stops him. FARRELL Drip-dry -- GILLIGAN Your shoes? FARRELL Drip-dry, too. GILLIGAN I guess they're drip-drying everything back home since we got shipwrecked. FARRELL We? GILLIGAN Yeah. FARRELL There are other people on this island beside yourself? GILLIGAN The Skipper, the Professor, Ginger, Mary Ann, Mister and Missus Howell. FARRELL I see. GILLIGAN I don't know how your boat got wrecked. No boats ever come around here. FARRELL I was destined for an island somewhere in this vicinity. GILLIGAN All the islands here are uninhabited except a few that have wild natives on them. FARRELL Well, that's just it. I was heading for an island with wild natives. I was going to help them rid their island of tropical diseases. You see, I'm a doctor. GILLIGAN A doctor? Oh boy, what a break, having a doctor here on the island. Did you save many lives? FARRELL Saved a few, lost a few. GILLIGAN Can't win them all. Gilligan shakes his head. Farrell shakes his head too. Gilligan nods. Farrell nods in return. Gilligan offers his hand to Farrell. GILLIGAN (cont'd) My name's Gilligan. FARRELL I'm Jackson Farrell. Doctor Jackson Farrell. GILLIGAN Glad to meet you, sir. Come on back to camp, I'll introduce you to the rest. You'll like them. I know you will. FARRELL I'm sure I will. Oh, I see you have a bow and arrow. Does that mean there are no guns on the island? GILLIGAN Oh, we have guns. FARRELL Oh? GILLIGAN No bullets. FARRELL Oh. Farrell smiles. Gilligan shows Farrell what he does with it. Gilligan removes an arrow from his quiver and places it into his bow. GILLIGAN I use it to shoot down dates. FARRELL Quite right. That's how we met. GILLIGAN You kind of get it like that, and then -- Gilligan lets go of the bowstring and the arrow flies. It flies right into the bag of money that Farrell hid earlier. The arrow anchors the bottom of the bag, which pivots and dumps its content. A shower of bills falls from the bag. Gilligan is astonished! He walks over to the tree. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Money! Farrell is right behind him. FARRELL Gilligan! GILLIGAN Money. FARRELL Gilligan. GILLIGAN Money, money, money! Farrell tries to calm Gilligan. FARRELL Now, Gilligan -- GILLIGAN We're rich! We're rich! Rich, rich, rich. FARRELL Gilligan, just a minute! GILLIGAN Don't worry, I'll cut you in 'cause you were here when I found it. Oh, boy. Gilligan notices the bag from which the money fell. GILLIGAN (cont'd) How did it get up there? He pulls the arrow out of the bag. Farrell takes the bag and collects the money into the bag. Gilligan uses an arrow to stab the money. FARRELL Now, let me explain, Gilligan. You remember me telling you about the natives and the tropical diseases? Well, this money was part of the endowment to build a hospital on that island. GILLIGAN Oh. FARRELL Fortunately, I saved the sack before the boat went down. GILLIGAN You mean, people donated this money to you? Farrell pauses. He nods. Gilligan stops stabbing the currency. Farrell grasps the end of the arrow and removes the money. FARRELL That's a good way to put it. They donated it to me. GILLIGAN It sure was generous of them. FARRELL Gilligan, you should have seen the way they handed it over to me. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY The Howells lounge on their chairs with tall glasses of tropical drinks as Gilligan and Farrell walk through the jungle toward camp. Mr. Howell's pith helmet is pulled over his face as he leans back in his chair. GILLIGAN (O.S.) Mister and Missus Howell? Mrs. Howell turns. MRS HOWELL Here comes Gilligan with a man we've never seen before. Mr. Howell pulls his pith helmet back. MR HOWELL Oh, I do wish he wouldn't drop by with people. We're not even dressed. GILLIGAN Mister and Missus Howell, I'd like you to meet Doctor Jackson Farrell. Mr. Howell gets up. MRS HOWELL Doctor? How marvelous! MR HOWELL Doctor, you know, I have the worst shooting pain. Mr. Howell points at his side. Farrell grabs his wrist as if he's checking Mr. Howell's pulse. FARRELL Have you had it before? MR HOWELL Yes, yes. Farrell places his hand on Mr. Howell's forehead. FARRELL Well, you've got it again. Farrell drops Mr. Howell's arm and releases his forehead. GILLIGAN He was shipwrecked like us. He was on his way to an island to help the natives. MR HOWELL You work with natives? That must be very rewarding. GILLIGAN I'm gonna go tell the others. Gilligan exits. MR HOWELL Yes, yes, you do. Will you sit down, Doctor? Perhaps you can join lovely Missus Howell and myself. Mr. Howell sits next to Mrs. Howell and Farrell sits on Mr. Howell's chair. MRS HOWELL So, you were wrecked en route to the island? FARRELL Yes, it came as quite a blow. I had great plans for the island: modern hospital, latest technical equipment, a lab -- MR HOWELL Oh, your laboratory. Hospitals happen to be one of our favorite charities. Lovey, remind me to send him a check. Will a few hundred thousand dollars be enough? Farrell is startled. He removes his hat. FARRELL A few hundred thousand? MRS HOWELL But, of course, Doctor, philanthropic work like yours must be encouraged. Native diseases so often affect the natives. MR HOWELL Doctor, for that kind of money, could you possibly name a disease after us? Farrell mulls it over. MRS HOWELL Yes. Not the run-of-the-mill disease, Doctor. Something a little special. For example, something like beriberi. Farrell nods in consideration of the idea. MR HOWELL Yes, yes, perhaps you could call it Howell-Howell. MRS HOWELL Oh, marvelous, Thurston! In that way, we'd each get separate billing. The Howells rub their noses together. Farrell is puzzled and doesn't know what to make of the Howells. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan explains Farrell's situation to Mary Ann and Ginger. Ginger leans on a tree. GILLIGAN And he was washed up on the island, just like we were. GINGER Oh, I'm so glad you were saved, Doctor. MARY ANN What a lucky break for us. In case any of us get sick, you can give us a shot. FARRELL That's true. (places hand over the gun hidden in his coat) I might be able to give you a shot at that. GILLIGAN He's a real famous doctor. He builds hospitals and everything. GINGER Oh, how exciting. What do you specialize in, Doctor? FARRELL Surgery. MARY ANN Surgery! FARRELL Yes, I've devoted most of my life to removing things. Farrell smiles and nods. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Professor, Gilligan, Farrell, and Skipper argue over where Farrell will bunk. The men eagerly try to convince Farrell to bunk with them. SKIPPER I insist that you move in with us -- FARRELL No, I won't hear of it. SKIPPER -- and share our hut. PROFESSOR Why certainly, Doctor. Everything we have is yours. FARRELL You're all very kind but I'm sure you're somewhat pressed for accommodations. PROFESSOR Oh, nonsense, we've got plenty of room. SKIPPER You could have Gilligan's bunk. Gilligan frowns. FARRELL Now, I don't wish to impose. SKIPPER Well, it's no imposition at all, is it, Gilligan? GILLIGAN (unenthusiastically) No, it's no imposition at all. SKIPPER Gilligan'll move his gear out right away. Won't you, Gilligan? GILLIGAN Sure, "he'll move his gear out right away, won't you, Gilligan?" Gilligan turns and walks over to the boys hut. FARRELL That Gilligan. Gilligan walks into the doorframe of the boys hut. INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Muttering under his breath, Gilligan enters the hut, walks over to his bunk, and rolls up his blanket. Gilligan turns on the radio. As the news report unfolds, Gilligan stops to listen carefully to the new bulletin. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) We interrupt this program for this special news bulletin. The international master criminal, Jackson Farrell, has escaped by sea with over a half million dollars taken in a holdup from the Monarch Bank last Thursday. Gilligan rhetorically asks the radio. GILLIGAN Jackson Farrell? Gilligan is in disbelief. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Yes, Jackson Farrell has done it again. No clues are available, but it is suspected that Farrell and his accomplices are hiding out somewhere in the tiny uncharted islands of the South Pacific. EXT. CAMP - DAY Professor, Farrell, and Skipper discuss rescue. PROFESSOR Well, Doctor, when they discover that you haven't arrived on this native island they'll send out a search party, won't they? FARRELL That's possible. Very possible. Gilligan emerges from the hut and tries to get the attention of Skipper. He puts the radio down on the ground. SKIPPER Well, is it possible that when your ship -- Excuse me, Doctor. What is it, Gilligan? Is something wrong with your finger? Farrell turns around. GILLIGAN Nothing wrong with my finger. SKIPPER Do you want the doctor to look at it? GILLIGAN No. SKIPPER Then will you stop interrupting? I'm having a very important conversation with the doctor here. Farrell turns back around. Gilligan waves his arms to get Skipper's attention again. Gilligan pantomimes a bank robbery by jabbing himself in the back and then holding up his arms. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, what I wanted to ask you is when your ship went down possibly they took a fix on our position. Gilligan waves at Skipper and points to his back. Gilligan sticks his arms up again. FARRELL Unfortunately, it all happened so quick -- Farrell turns around and sees Gilligan with his arms stretched above him. He recovers by turning it into a fish story. GILLIGAN I just wanted to say I caught a fish this big. SKIPPER Well, good for you, Gilligan. Now, will you get in the hut and clean it out so the doctor can move in? FARRELL What's that you've got there, Gilligan? A transistor radio? Gilligan picks up the radio. GILLIGAN Yes, sir. Farrell begins to grow suspicious. FARRELL Oh, then you're able to receive news from the outside world. GILLIGAN Well, we could if it worked. SKIPPER Well, Gilligan, there's nothing wrong with that -- Gilligan pretends to turn on the radio. GILLIGAN See? I turn it on, nothing even happens. Skipper walks over to Gilligan. SKIPPER Give me that radio. Gilligan tries to keep the radio away from Skipper. GILLIGAN No, Skipper. It doesn't work, Skipper. No, Skipper. It doesn't work. SKIPPER Give me the radio. GILLIGAN Skipper, it doesn't work. Skipper and Gilligan fight for control of the radio, but it falls out of their hands. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Now you did it. You broke it. It'll never work now. SKIPPER You'd better hope it works, Gillian! RADIO on the ground. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Repeating our previous bulletin. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan looks at the radio with dread. As the story is retold, Gilligan picks up the radio. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) It has been definitely confirmed that the holdup of the Monarch Bank was masterminded by Jackson Farrell. Gilligan turns off the radio. GILLIGAN Well, that's the news for today. Let's go back and hit the hut. Farrell pulls the gun out of his suitcoat. FARRELL Hold it! (motions Professor to join Skipper and Gilligan) So now you know. Before too long, a boat will arrive to pick me up. Until that time, I don't want any problems. If any problems do arise, I won't hesitate to eliminate them. Any questions? Gilligan raises his hand. GILLIGAN Any bullets in that gun? Farrell smiles and fires the gun. Professor tenses up. The bullet hits the door frame between Gilligan and Skipper. FARRELL Any more questions? Gilligan nods briskly. Skipper turns and looks at the bullet hole in the door frame. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. CAMP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Skippers sits on his bunk. Gilligan and Professor stare out the window and door of the hut. SKIPPER Any sign of him? GILLIGAN No, he must be down by the fire someplace. PROFESSOR Well, we've got to have a plan of action. It seems reasonable he can't stay awake all night. SKIPPER Exactly. He's gotta doze off sometime. That's when we can get his gun. GILLIGAN Yeah, and when he dozes off, you two jump him and his gun will fly up in the air, and I'll catch it and say... Gilligan motions as if he had a gun and points it out the window. Farrell pops up in the window pointing the GUN at Gilligan. GILLIGAN (cont'd) ... Good evening. FARRELL Good evening. It sounds like a very intriguing plan. Now, stay right there. Farrell opens the hut door and enters the hut. He points his gun at Gilligan as he explains the new situation. FARRELL (cont'd) Don't move. I've just finished tying up the others for the evening and now I want you (motions gun at Gilligan) to tie up both of them. Him first. Farrell motions the gun toward Skipper and hands a ROPE to Skipper. Gilligan takes the rope and walks over to Skipper. GILLIGAN Skipper, you'd better lay down. Gilligan ties Skipper to his bunk. SKIPPER (whispers) Leave it a little loose. GILLIGAN (loudly) Leave it a little what? Gilligan realizes his mistake and looks over at Farrell, who insistently points his gun at Gilligan. DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT - LATER Skipper is thoroughly tied to his bunk. Gilligan lies next to him on a bunk. Farrell secures the rope on Professor on the third bunk. FARRELL There. That should keep you gentlemen in place for the night. I hope I haven't cut off your circulation. GILLIGAN Oh, no, no. See? Gilligan moves his legs to show Farrell that the ropes are entirely too loose. Gilligan wiggles his foot and the rope falls off. He waves his leg in the air. Farrell crouches down and reties Gilligan's leg. As he rises to his feet, he pats Gilligan on his knee. FARRELL Thanks for telling me, Gilligan. GILLIGAN You're welcome. Farrell turns and exits the hut. DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT - LATER Skipper awakes and realizes some time has passed. He looks around and doesn't see Farrell, so he pulls at his bonds. He tries to rock his bunk so that he might get on his feet. On the second try, Skipper makes it further. The third try is almost successful. Skipper lies all the way back down. Gilligan sees what the Skipper has been doing and tries to get his bunk upright. Professor joins in. All three try to get their bunks upright. They struggle, but Skipper finally makes it to his feet. Gilligan joins him. Professor finally makes it to his feet too. Skipper hobbles over to the door, but the bunk is too tall to make it through the door. He backs away from the door and turns to Gilligan. SKIPPER Gilligan, you try. You're thinner than I am. Gilligan walks his bunk over to the door. SKIPPER (cont'd) Bend way down. Gilligan slams into the door frame. SKIPPER (cont'd) No, bend down. Gilligan bends over forward and carries his bunk on his back. SKIPPER (cont'd) That's it. Professor joins Skipper at the door. They try to push Gilligan through the door. SKIPPER (cont'd) Come on, give him a push. Push, Gilligan. Gilligan's face is wedged between the hut door and the bunk behind him. Skipper and Professor push. GILLIGAN No. SKIPPER Professor, push him. Gilligan's face is mashed against the door. GILLIGAN Skipper, I'm stuck. Gilligan's eyes grow wide. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper, he's coming back. EXT. CAMP - NIGHT Jackson Farrell emerges from the jungle and walks across the camp clearing. INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Professor, Gilligan, and Skipper line up their bunks and ease them back onto the ground. SKIPPER Get down, boys. They slowly descend to a horizontal, reclining position. Farrell looks in the window, hears the men snoring, smiles, turns around and walks away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY The Howells look for Farrell in the jungle. They come across his suitcase. MR HOWELL Mister -- Mister Farrell? MRS HOWELL Mister Farrell? MR HOWELL Farrell, where are you, Mister Farrell? MRS HOWELL Mister Farrell? Farrell hears them calling for him and emerges from the jungle behind them. MR HOWELL Mister Farrell? Mister Farrell? MRS HOWELL Mister Farrell? The Howells stop at the overturned tree trunk at the makeshift camp Farrell had set up. Farrell sneaks up behind the Howells. FARRELL Yeah? Mr. Howell is startled. MR HOWELL Mister Ferrell, Missus Howell and I have been discussing this rather sticky situation that does exist between us. MRS HOWELL Yes, you know, the fact that you're a thief instead of a doctor. MR HOWELL Please, please Lovey. Doctor Farrell -- I mean, Mister Farrell -- I think this is something that could be negotiated between us. FARRELL Oh? Mr. Howell removes a piece of driftwood from his coat. MR HOWELL So, I have this piece of driftwood--you see--I've used as a check--you see. DRIFTWOOD CHECK MR HOWELL (cont'd) It says: "Pay to the order ... BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL (cont'd) ... of Mister Jackson Ferrell one hundred thousand dollars." And my signature. Farrell takes the driftwood from Mr. Howell and examines it. FARRELL A hundred thousand? DRIFTWOOD CHECK A small piece of seaweed makes it appear like there is a comma after the first zero, making it look like $10,000. FARRELL (O.S.) That says ten thousand. BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL Ten thousand? Oh, no... DRIFTWOOD CHECK Mr. Howell wipes off the seaweed, revealing that the intent was $100,000. MR HOWELL (O.S.) ... that comma, that's a piece of seaweed. BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL Here we are. FARRELL Are you kidding? If I try to cash this crazy check, the police will be on me in a second. MRS HOWELL Thurston, he's right. It would be disastrous for Mister Farrell to cash that check. MR HOWELL Please, Lovey. (to Farrell) Sometimes I think a woman's place is in the hut. Mr. Howell takes his driftwood check back. He takes Mrs. Howell's arm, they turn, and walk back down the path. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper sneaks around the boys hut and sees Farrell as he sits around the corner, enjoying a beverage from a bamboo glass. Satisfied, Skipper sneaks back to Gilligan to hatch their plan. Gilligan stands on a low rung on a ladder which reaches to the top of the hut. Gilligan holds a net with coconut anchors. SKIPPER It's the perfect setup. GILLIGAN Oh, great. SKIPPER I'll help you up. Okay? Gilligan swings the net into Skipper's belly. Gilligan clumsily climbs the ladder. Skipper lifts the weighted net. Gilligan hoists the net over his shoulder, but it is so large that it is unwieldy. Gilligan slightly loses his balance and backs into Skipper, who tries to hold up the weighted net. Gilligan climbs up a few rungs. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, will you stop that? I'm on your side. Gilligan smiles and climbs up a few rungs. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, I'll grab his gun after you hit him. Gilligan climbs down a few rungs. GILLIGAN How come we have to -- The weighted net comes down on Skipper. Gilligan nearly drops the coconut-weighted net on Skipper. It envelops Skipper's head. Skipper struggles to get the coconuts off his head. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Give me a hand, Skipper. Gilligan climbs up the rungs of the ladder. As Gilligan moves up the ladder, Skipper climbs up a few rungs. Gilligan climbs onto the thatched roof of the hut. He gathers the coconuts and carries the them. His foot catches on the ladder and Skipper moves Gilligan's foot. Gilligan climbs across the roof, carrying the coconut weighted net, to a spot above Farrell. Gilligan peers down and evaluates the scene. Gilligan smiles and flashes the "okay" sign back to Skipper. Gilligan gathers up the net and lifts it over his head. SKIPPER winces as he hears a CRASH. Expectantly, Skipper sneaks around the corner to check on their trap. The chair on which Farrell sat is overturn, the net covering it, and Farrell's hat sits on top. The chair moves like there is someone under it. SKIPPER Nice work, Gilligan! We did it! We've got him! Farrell pops up, still holding his beverage, from the nearby underbrush. FARRELL We have? Farrell and Skipper both look to the chair. ZOOM TO GILLIGAN as he crawls out from under the netted chair. He spits out a fruit peel. GILLIGAN I'm sorry. I slipped. Gilligan looks sheepish. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Ginger carries a bamboo container along a path in the jungle. Professor comes up behind her. PROFESSOR Here, let me help you. GINGER Thank you, Professor. Gee, there must be something we can do. They stop. PROFESSOR Well, that gun is the key to the situation. If we could get that gun before his friends arrive, we'd have a chance. GINGER I think I've got an idea how to get that gun. Farrell appears on the path behind them. PROFESSOR Oh? How? Ginger turns and sees Farrell coming. GINGER (whispering) Watch it, he's coming. (loudly) Okay, then be jealous. I'm telling you he's my kind of man. PROFESSOR What? GINGER If that's going to be your attitude, I don't want any part of you. Get lost. Go on, get lost! Professor catches on. Ginger turns and walks toward Farrell. Professor makes a hasty exit. Ginger grabs Farrell's arm. GINGER (cont'd) Mister Farrell, we were just discussing you. Won't you sit down? Farrell sits down on a chair. GINGER (cont'd) We were getting along so beautifully when we first met. Ginger removes his hat and tosses it aside. FARRELL That's when you thought I was a doctor. Ginger seductively puts her arms around his neck and gently strokes him. GINGER Yes. You're even more interesting now. It must be fascinating going to all those exotic places all over the world. When your friends come back how about taking me with you? FARRELL Say, that's an idea. I've got enough loot now to cover you in minks, sables -- You'd like that, huh? GINGER I'm a woman. FARRELL Yeah, I noticed. Ginger runs her hand down his chest. She moves to the other side of the chair and sits down next to him. Ginger runs her hands down his chest and puts one hand inside his suitcoat. GINGER We could make beautiful music together, Jackson. Beautiful music. FARRELL Ginger? GINGER Yes, Jackson? FARRELL And that beautiful music will be: "And the Angels Sing," if you get any closer to that gun. Farrell hears Gilligan running up the path and jumps to his feet. EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan runs out from the jungle to the clearing. Mary Ann follows him closely. GILLIGAN Hey, Skipper! Hey, Skipper! Hey, Skipper! Professor rushes into meet them. Farrell and Ginger enter from the other side. FARRELL What's the hurry, Gilligan? GILLIGAN There's a boat rowing ashore. FARRELL It would seem my departure is near at hand. Farrell climbs up the bamboo ladder to the roof of the boys hut. Gilligan and Professor help him up the ladder. PROFESSOR Mister Farrell, when you get back to civilization how about telling them we're stranded on this island? ROOF Farrell lies on his stomach on the roof, peering out to the ocean. FARRELL And run the risk of you returning and blowing the whistle on me and my friends? Gilligan, give me that glass. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan picks up a bamboo spyglass leaning on the hut and hands it up to Farrell. ROOF Farrell takes the spyglass and looks through it toward the ocean. That isn't any of my boys. It's the Indigo Mob. BACK TO SCENE MARY ANN The Indigo Mob? FARRELL They must have tailed me. Skipper, Mister and Missus Howell! HUT DOOR as the Howells and Skipper emerge from the hut. Farrell takes Mary Ann's hand and pulls her away from the other castaways. Farrell removes his gun and points it at them. FARRELL (cont'd) Now, you are all going to do exactly as I say. ZOOM TO PROFESSOR MATCH FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Professor stands dressed as an island native. He has woolly hair, face paint, beads, various plants fashioned into decorations in his hair. PAN TO MRS. HOWELL who is dressed similarly, with face paint, large hoop earrings, and flowers in her woolly hair. PAN TO MR. HOWELL who is dressed as an island native chief. He wears a headdress, face paint, beads, and feathers. PAN TO GINGER who wears face paint, long dangling earrings, and a flower in her hair. PAN TO SKIPPER who wears woolly hair, face paint, and beads. Finally, PAN TO GILLIGAN who wears woolly hair, beads, face paint and earrings like the others. PAN TO FARRELL as he holds Mary Ann hostage and grasps her arm. He points his gun at her. FARRELL Remember, as natives you speak no English. Understand? You'll answer all questions in native gibberish. GILLIGAN But, sir, what if we happen to have -- Skipper puts his hand over Gilligan's mouth. Gilligan gets the gist and starts speaking in gibberish as Skipper releases his hand. Farrell smiles at him and Gilligan smiles back. Farrell moves to get a better view of the jungle path and pulls Mary Ann with him. He sees the members of the Indigo mob coming down the path. He draws Mary Ann inside the hut. FARRELL I'll be inside the hut with a gun pointed at your pretty little friend. Remember, one slip-up, and no pretty little friend. Farrell shuts the hut door behind him. INDIGO MOB appear at the edge of camp. CASTAWAYS dressed as natives are lined up. INTERCUT LUCKY I hope one of them can understand English. HANK I've seen a lot of primitive tribes in my day, but this one takes the cake. This outfit can set back civilization two thousand years. The castaways begin moving. Ginger dances. LUCKY Looking for white man. Criminal. He hold up bank. Lucky forms the shape of guns with his fingers. Ginger continues to dance. Mr. Howell nods. FARRELL AND MARY ANN Farrell threatens her with his gun. BACK TO SCENE LUCKY (cont'd) No speak English? HANK Lucky, it looks to me like they don't speak anything. LUCKY Yeah, come on, let's get out of here. Skipper speaks in gibberish and Gilligan makes noises. Hank walks over to them. HANK Oh, so you do talk. Hank points at Gilligan and Skipper. HANK (cont'd) Lucky, get a load of these two. It's hard to believe they're human beings. LUCKY Yeah. Hank walks over to Ginger. LUCKY (cont'd) That one don't need to speak any. HANK You can say that again. Hello, dolly. LUCKY I think she's trying to tell you something, Hank. HANK I'm trying to tell her something, too. Hank bites the air. LUCKY It's a good thing she can't understand English. She'd slap your face. Ginger slaps his face. Hank is stunned. He leans over to Skipper. Skipper points to the hut with one hand, but masks his action with the other. HANK Must have been the way I said it. Let's get out of here. Lucky and Hank walk to leave. As they pass Mr. Howell, he speaks. MR HOWELL Moola, moola, moola. Lucky and Hank stop. HANK I could have sworn I heard him say, "Moola, moola, moola." Even the most native tribes must know about money. LUCKY He looks like the village bum. Mr. Howell points to the hut while masking the gesture with his body. MR HOWELL Moola, moola, moola. HANK I guess he's asking for a handout. MR HOWELL Indeed. Mrs. Howell scolds him in gibberish. She stomps her foot onto Mr. Howell's foot and Mr. Howell gets the message. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Okey-dokey. HANK How do you like that? Even the natives are henpecked. Let's get out of here. Lucky and Hank exit. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAGOON - DAY Gates arrived in their boat, which rests on the lagoon shore. Professor, Skipper, and Gilligan help them load the Farrell's provisions and money onto the boat. FARRELL I want to thank you all for coming down here and seeing me off. Gilligan hands Gates a bed roll. Gates loads it onto the boat. PROFESSOR Mister Jackson, please. Notify the authorities about us. GATES Sure we will, huh, boss? Gilligan lifts a bag of money and turns toward the jungle. Gates catches him by the arm. Gilligan shakes Gates hand, but hands the bag to Skipper. Skipper pivots and hands the bag to Professor. Professor takes a step away from shore, but Farrell stops him and takes the bag of money. Farrell hands the bag to Gates. Gates puts the bag onto the boat. Farrell and Gates step into the boat and points his gun at the men. FARRELL Nobody likes a wise guy. All right, let's shove off. Gates pulls on the cord to start the outboard motor. FARRELL (cont'd) Come on, Slim, give us a hand. Skipper and Professor help push their boat off shore. The motor putters to life. The anchor line stretches to shore, where the anchor sits. Farrell realizes they are still tethered to shore. FARRELL (cont'd) Gilligan, give us the anchor. Gilligan removes the anchor where it is hooked behind a fallen tree trunk. He swings it around his head like a shot put. FARRELL FARRELL (cont'd) No! No, don't throw it! Bring it to me! GILLIGAN as he winds up and releases the anchor. BOAT The anchor misses the boat, but the line wraps itself around a bag of money and pulls it overboard. The bag sinks with the anchor. Farrell looks over the side of the boat in dismay. FARRELL (cont'd) The money! The money! Farrell and Gates look toward the motor. BOAT OUTBOARD MOTOR Currency floats to the top of the water after it has been chopped to bits. BACK TO SCENE FARRELL (cont'd) Stop the motor! Stop the motor! The propeller's chewing the money up to bits. Gates kills the motor. Farrell stands up and steps off the boat into the lagoon. LAGOON SHORE Professor, Gilligan, and Skipper watch from shore. BACK TO SCENE Farrell dives down and pulls up handfuls of destroyed currency. FARRELL (cont'd) It's all chopped up! It's all chopped up! LAGOON SHORE GILLIGAN Cheaters never prosper. BACK TO SCENE Farrell toss the handfuls of money aside and reaches down into his coat and pulls out his gun. FARRELL I've gotta get that Gilligan! LAGOON SHORE Skipper, Gilligan, and Professor hit the sand. BACK TO SCENE FARRELL (cont'd) I've gotta give it to that Gilligan! He pulls the trigger and like a squirt gun, only water comes out. Farrell looks at his gun in disappointment. GATES The gun is wet, boss. FARRELL Thanks for the information. SKIPPER Hey, their gun is full of water. Come on, let's get them! Professor, Gilligan, and Skipper run into the lagoon. Gates points to the castaways running into the water. GATES Here they come, boss. FARRELL Let's get out of here. With Gilligan on that island, you can't win. Farrell climbs back into the boat. Skipper, Professor, and Gilligan swim after them. Gates steers the boat toward the ocean. PROFESSOR It's no use, Skipper. We can't catch them. Gilligan dives under the water. SKIPPER I guess you're right, Professor. Gilligan resurfaces. GILLIGAN Look, I'm looking for the money, and I think I got it. SKIPPER Bring it up! GILLIGAN I got it! Gilligan pulls a lobster out of the water. The men laugh. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY The radio sits on the floor. Gilligan sits at the table. A spool of currency, pasted together from bits, is spooled on the floor. Gilligan uses a brush and a container of paste to glue the bits together. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) We interrupt this program to bring you a late news bulletin. The Coast Guard has boarded the Sea Spray and apprehended Jackson Farrell and his gang of bank robbers. GILLIGAN Hey, Skipper! Skipper! Skipper enters the hut. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The authorities were unable to locate any of the loot from the Monarch Bank holdup, but several members of the gang confessed and Jackson Farrell and his men are being brought back for further questioning. SKIPPER The Coast Guard got them! Good for them! GILLIGAN Yeah, they'll put them in jail where they belong. Skipper notices the string of bills spilling onto the floor. SKIPPER What are you doing? GILLIGAN Oh, well, I went skin-diving for the rest of the money, all the pieces. Boy, there's just some big bills. I've never seen so many zeros. SKIPPER And what is it you're doing with them? GILLIGAN I want to make one long million-dollar bill. Gilligan counts off a length of currency. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Here, Skipper, have one -- (counts bills) Here, (hands strip of bills) have three hundred thousand dollars. SKIPPER Thanks, little buddy. Skipper accepts the strip of bills from Gilligan. FADE OUT. THE END 
Episode #54, “The Postman Cometh” The bachelors on the island try to romance Mary Ann after they hear on the radio that her boyfriend is marrying someone else. However, Mary Ann misunderstands their intentions and concludes that she is dying from eating poisonous mushrooms.  “The Postman Cometh ”  By  Herbert Finn  and  Alan Dinehart  January 20, 1966  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. LAGOON - DAY Mary Ann and Gilligan walk down the path to the lagoon. Mary Ann tightly rolls a message so it can fit into the bottle that Gilligan carries. Gilligan removes the cork from the bottle, turns away, and covers his eyes. MARY ANN You don't have to close your eyes, Gilligan. GILLIGAN It's against the law to read anybody else‘s mail. Mary Ann places the message into the bottle. She taps it with her palm to make sure it goes in. MARY ANN I promise not to report you. Gilligan replaces the cork. GILLIGAN Okay. It'll go out in the two o'clock tide. MARY ANN Thank you. GILLIGAN Your boyfriend sure is lucky. He not only gets a letter every week, he gets a nickel back on the envelope. Gilligan walks to the water's edge. He stops, turns to look at Mary Ann, waves, and then tosses the bottle into the lagoon. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper sits on the bamboo bicycle seat and pedals the generator. It is connected by wires to a ten coconut cups. Gilligan approaches him from behind. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. What are you doing? SKIPPER I'm recharging the batteries on the radio. Now, if it isn't too exhausting, would you mind turning the radio on to see if it works? Gilligan turns on the radio and sits down. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now here's a social note. Café society was stunned today by the surprise elopement of Cybil Wentworth, the shipping heiress, ... RADIO sits on the table. Wires appear to be attached to the generator that Skipper pedals. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) ... with Horacce Higgenbothum. Higgenbathurn is said to come from a small town near Horner's ... BACK TO SCENE RADIO ANNOUNCER ... Corners, Kansas. GILLIGAN Did he say Horace Higgenbothum? SKIPPER Yeah. GILLIGAN From Horner's Corners? SKIPPER That's right. Why? Do you know him? Skipper stops pedaling and moves closer to Gilligan. GILLIGAN That's Mary Ann's boyfriend. SKIPPER Mary Ann's boyfriend? As Skipper sits down at another chair at the table he turns the radio off. GILLIGAN Yeah, you know, the one she keeps writing letter to every day. I just mailed one for her. SKIPPER Why, that dirty double-crosser! Marrying another girl. For goodness sakes. And doing that to our poor little Mary Ann? GILLIGAN Maybe he's trying to make her jealous. FADE OUT END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. SUPPLY HUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY INT. SUPPLY HUT - DAY Professor, Skipper, and Gilligan discuss Mary Ann's situation. Skipper and Professor stand on opposite sides of a small table. Gilligan stands near the door of the hut and fiddles with his hat. SKIPPER Hi, Professor. PROFESSOR Well, Skipper, what's the decision? Professor places one foot on a chair. Skipper motions to Gilligan. SKIPPER Well, Gilligan was just about to volunteer. Gilligan steps forward. GILLIGAN Oh, no I'm not! SKIPPER Oh, yes you are. GILLIGAN Oh, no. Let somebody else tell Mary Ann that some girl stole her boyfriend right out from under her nose with her back turned. Gilligan makes a face as he realizes that his statement did not make sense. SKIPPER Under her nose with her back turned? PROFESSOR Well, it's anatomically impossible, of course. However, Gilligan does have a point. He should have freedom of choice. GILLIGAN And I choose to wait until after we're rescued, and then Horace can tell her because he knows her better than we do. Gilligan turns toward the door, but Skipper grabs his arm to stop him. SKIPPER Wait a minute, Gilligan. All right, Professor, we'll do this the democratic way. Gilligan turns toward the door again, but Skipper grabs his arm to stop him again. GILLIGAN I'll buy that. SKIPPER Yes, Gilligan. Now all those in favor of Gilligan telling Mary Ann raise your right hand. Skipper and Professor both raise their right hands. SKIPPER (cont'd) There you are, Gilligan. Two-to-one. Skipper turns Gilligan around and pats him on the hip. SKIPPER (cont'd) On your way, little buddy. Gilligan walks to the door, opens it, and turns around. GILLIGAN If that's the democratic way, I'm gonna turn into Republican. Gilligan turns around and the door hits him in the face, knocking his hat off. He picks up his hat, and exits to camp. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann cooks a pot of mushrooms over a fire. The radio sits on a nearby table with pot holders, a mixing bowl, plate, spoon, and fork. Mary Ann dips a spoon in the pot, takes it out, blows lightly on the spoon, picks a mushroom out of the spoon, and eats it. She smiles, pleased with the taste. She wipes her hand on a pot holder. Mary Ann turns on the radio and sits down to listen to it. RADIO NARRATOR (V.O.) Now once again, it's time for radio's most popular dramatic series, "Old Doctor Young." When last we left County Hospital, Eileen Frobersher had been admitted for a checkup. Unbeknownst to her, her X-rays revealed something. Mary Ann looks concerned. RADIO NARRATOR (V.O.) (cont'd) Meanwhile, in another part of the hospital old Doctor Young is talking to his son, young Doctor Young. OLD DR YOUNG (V.O.) Son, the young and lovely Eileen Frobersher must be told about her X-rays. Gilligan appears from the jungle behind Mary Ann. He hears the radio program and stops. YOUNG DR YOUNG (V.O.) But, Father, should we tell her now? OLD DR YOUNG (V.O.) Not "we." You. And right now. He listens to it and gulps, almost as if the words were meant for him. YOUNG DR YOUNG (V.O.) If that is my duty, then I shall do it. Gilligan walks toward Mary Ann. OLD DR YOUNG (V.O.) Son, you are walking the wrong way. Gilligan stops. YOUNG DR YOUNG (V.O.) Because I cannot just burst into her room and blurt out the results of the X-rays. That I cannot do. Gilligan shakes his head. YOUNG DR YOUNG (V.O.) (cont'd) You will have to assign someone else to the job. Gilligan nods in agreement. He turns and walks back toward the jungle. OLD DR YOUNG (V.O.) Son, be a man. Remember the Hippocratic oath. Gilligan stops and turns toward Mary Ann again. YOUNG DR YOUNG (V.O.) Yes, father. You are always right. Gilligan weakly nods. YOUNG DR YOUNG (V.O.) (cont'd) I will do it! Gilligan walks toward Mary Ann. YOUNG DR YOUNG (V.O.) (cont'd) Tomorrow. Gilligan turns around again and heads into the jungle. Mary Ann eats mushrooms from the spoon. FLIP TO: INT. SUPPLY HUT - DAY Skipper sits on a table. Professor sits at the table. Gilligan stands by the door. Skipper stands up and paces as the lectures Gilligan. SKIPPER Can't you do anything right? GILLIGAN You see -- SKIPPER For goodness sakes, I mean, must you goof up the simplest assignment? GILLIGAN Well, you see -- SKIPPER Around here, it's talk, talk, talk, talk, but not a word to Mary Ann. Professor stands and joins the discussion. PROFESSOR Gentlemen, this arguing isn't getting us anywhere. GILLIGAN I wasn't arguing. All I was saying was, "You see." He was the one who was arguing. PROFESSOR Well, I can see that I'm going to have to tell her myself. Professor exits. SKIPPER I wanna tell you, he beat me by that much. Another second, and I'd have told her. GILLIGAN Oh, I can still catch him. Gilligan turns and walks toward the door. Skipper restrains him by the back of Gilligan's shirt. He pulls Gilligan back. SKIPPER Thanks a lot, little buddy. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann listens to the end of the radio program. She's practically in tears over the plight of Eileen Frobersher. RADIO NARRATOR (V.O.) And so we conclude another chapter in the story of Old Doctor Young. Mary Ann turns off the radio. She wipes tears from her cheeks, stands, and moves to her cooking pot. Professor emerges from the jungle behind her. Mary Ann dips the spoon in the pot again and picks a mushroom off the spoon and eats it. PROFESSOR Hello, Mary Ann. Say -- (notices the kettle) Oh, something smells good. What are you cooking? MARY ANN Mushrooms. I picked them myself. PROFESSOR Oh, that's nice. Uh, Mary Ann-- MARY ANN Yes? PROFESSOR Uh, there's something I've gotta tell you. MARY ANN Is something wrong? PROFESSOR Well, yes, there is. Mary Ann sits down on the chair. MARY ANN Well, it couldn't be half as bad as--as what happened to poor Eileen Frobersher. I wouldn't trade places with her for anything else in the world. Professor quizzically looks at Mary Ann. PROFESSOR Who? Mary Ann gestures to the radio. MARY ANN Eileen Frobersher, the poor girl on the radio. PROFESSOR Oh, yes, of course. Well, you see, it's just that--uh-uh, the mushrooms. You've got to be careful. MARY ANN Careful? About what? PROFESSOR The--the species. I mean, some mushrooms and toadstools can make you quite ill and others are actually poisonous. Mary Ann stands. MARY ANN Poisonous? PROFESSOR Oh, you can never tell. You've got to get rid of those. Professor heads back into the jungle. Mary Ann uses the pot holders to help her remove the pot from the fire. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper, Gilligan, and Professor sit at the castaway's dining table. Gilligan rests is head on this arm. Mr. Howell sits on the table, sipping from a straw in a tall bamboo drinking glass. Ginger stands. GINGER Well, it's a good thing you didn't say anything to Mary Ann. I mean, that'd be all wrong. GILLIGAN It would? GINGER Well, certainly. There's only one thing that can ease her breaking heart when she hears about Horace Higgenbothum. I mean, only one thing can make a girl forget a man. MR HOWELL What's that, Ginger? GINGER Another man. You see, Mary Ann needs a dream man. Someone very exciting to just come along and sweep her off her feet. MR HOWELL Well, I'm terribly sorry, Ginger, but I'm already married. GINGER Well, Mister Howell, there's three eligible bachelors on the island. Mr. Howell stands and walks behind Ginger. MR HOWELL You're so right! With three attractive bachelors vying for her attention all thoughts of Horace will vanish. GINGER Exactly. PROFESSOR Now, just a moment. I have never shown the slightest romantic interest in Mary Ann. GINGER Professor, a few lessons at my private charm school and you'll just captivate her. Skipper stands too. SKIPPER Oh, now wait a minute, Ginger. I've been acting like her big brother. I can't act like her boyfriend now. MR HOWELL For her sake, it's Casanova time, Captain. I'm going to take you in hand. GILLIGAN What about me? Who's gonna teach me? MR HOWELL It's a nasty trick to play on my wife, but, uh, (in French) c'est la guerre. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Gilligan kneels before Mrs. Howell. He holds her hand in both of his. GILLIGAN Your hair, with the light shining on it, is breathtakingly beautiful. MRS HOWELL Oh, Gilligan! Gilligan stands. GILLIGAN And your eyes are limpid pools of indigo blue. MRS HOWELL Oh, Gilligan! GILLIGAN Shell-like ears and pearly teeth. Those lips, those nose! MRS HOWELL Oh, Gilligan. Mrs. Howell drops her hand and Gilligan releases hers. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Missus Howell, but I -- I am improving. This time I got as far as the nose before I blew it. MRS HOWELL You're supposed to charm Mary Ann, not take inventory. Now, can't you use a more romantic voice? (sultry) More breathless. GILLIGAN Mary Ann, you're peachy keen. Gilligan wheezes. MRS HOWELL Gilligan, you're supposed to sound romantic, not asthmatic. GILLIGAN Not so good, huh? MRS HOWELL No, we'll have to try another approach. We'll pattern you after somebody else. Now, let me see. Oh, I have it. Charles Boyer! FLIP TO: INT. SUPPLY HUT - DAY MR. HOWELL kneels on the ground, making a grand romantic gesture. MR HOWELL "How do I love thee?" PULL BACK to reveal Mr. Howell holding Skipper's hand. MR HOWELL (cont'd) "Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height that my soul can reach." Skipper fidgets. SKIPPER Oh, Mister Howell, I -- I feel so silly. Must you hold my hand like that? Mr. Howell stands and releases Skipper's hand. MR HOWELL Well, I'm just trying to show you how to act. That's all. Mr. Howell puts his hat on. Skipper sits on the table. SKIPPER Oh, I know. But I -- Mister Howell -- I me -- I can't recite poetry. It just isn't my image. MR HOWELL Your image? Just exactly what is your image? SKIPPER Well, I've always figured myself as the big outdoor type. MR HOWELL Well, you are built like the Ponderosa. SKIPPER Oh, no. You know what I mean. The big, strong, silent type. You know, I've always thought that I should be a cowboy. MR HOWELL Somewhere there breathes a horse that is glad that you are not. SKIPPER Come on, Mister Howell. Now you know how the girls are always crazy about Marshal Dillon. MR HOWELL Come to think of it, they do favor outdoor types. Yes, yes. Skipper stands. SKIPPER Exactly. I mean, they like men that talk about (cowboy voice) riding the range, and--and bulldogging, and shootouts, and all that sort of thing. Skipper swaggers toward the door and turns to look toward Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL Okay, Branco Billy, head her off at the pass! Skipper salutes. SKIPPER (cowboy voice) You're on, partner. Skipper opens the door and swaggers out. MR HOWELL They went that-a-way. INT. GIRLS HUT - DAY Professor enters through the door. He walks over to Ginger, who role-plays Mary Ann. Ginger sits at a small table. She holds a hand mirror and spritzes perfume over her neckline. PROFESSOR Good evening, Mary Ann. Ginger puts the perfume and mirror down on the table. PROFESSOR (cont'd) (awkwardly) Ah, you look very healthy tonight. GINGER Oh, brother. Professor reflects on his performance. PROFESSOR Oh, that wasn't much like Cary Grant, was it? GINGER It wasn't even very much like General Grant. PROFESSOR I'll never be able to learn this. Ginger stands and moves over to Professor. GINGER Let me show you, Professor. Now -- pretend that I'm Cary Grant. PROFESSOR You? GINGER Yeah. Pretend that I'm tall, charming, loaded with masculinity. PROFESSOR Well, I shall find it very easy to pretend you're tall and charming, but -- uh -- you've got the wrong kind of load. GINGER Well, we're just pretending, Professor. Now, Cary is the kind of man who sweeps a girl off her feet. He'd take her in his arms, like this, (embraces him) and he'd whisper her name over and over and over. Mary Ann. Mary Ann. Mary Ann. PROFESSOR Isn't that a bit redundant? Ginger releases her embrace. GINGER Professor, a girl likes to hear her name! Now, let's try it again. Professor licks his lips. Ginger embraces him. GINGER (cont'd) Mary Ann. Mary Ann. Mary Ann. (whispers) Now you whisper something to me. PROFESSOR Uh, Cary? GINGER Yes? Professor sniffs. PROFESSOR Gee, you smell nice tonight. GINGER Oh. Ginger pushes Professor away. He falls back onto one of the girls' beds. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Mary Ann sits at a small table and sews a dress. A knock at the door. MARY ANN Come in. Gilligan enters wearing a beret and carries a bouquet of mostly blue flowers. He wears a thin mustache, which was drawn on his upper lip. GILLIGAN Ah, (in French) Mon cheri, quel surprise to find you at home. I brought these (in French) pour vous. Gilligan hands the bouquet of flowers to Mary Ann. She accepts them, but looks puzzled. GILLIGAN (cont'd) And now, I kiss your hand, huh? Gilligan reaches for her hand and pulls it toward him. The bouquet in Mary Ann's hand hits Gilligan in the face. He pushes the bouquet to the side and kisses her hand with noisy kissing sounds before finally releasing it. MARY ANN Gilligan, do you feel all right? Gilligan gently helps Mary Ann to her feet and guides her across the room. GILLIGAN (in French) Oui. Come, let us sit over here, so I can tell you about the (in French) le Plume de ma Tante, which is across the street from the Casbah. (in French) Oui. Casbah, hmmm? Gilligan puckers and makes kissing motions. A knock at the door. MARY ANN Uh -- I'll be right back. Mary Ann uses the opportunity to get away from Gilligan. Flower bouquet in hand, she answers the door. Skipper stands outside, looking down. He wears a cowboy hat, a starfish for a badge, and a belt with holsters. He also carries a bouquet of pink flowers. He looks up as Mary Ann opens the door. SKIPPER Howdy, ma'am! MARY ANN Oh, Skipper, come on in. Mary Ann holds the door open for him. Skipper saunters into the hut, but does not notice Gilligan. MARY ANN (cont'd) Oh boy, am I glad to see you. Oh, the strangest thing just happened. Gilligan came -- Skippers belt drops the the floor and he picks it up. MARY ANN (cont'd) "Howdy, ma'am"? SKIPPER Yup. I sure am glad to see you're alone, ma'am. MARY ANN Well, I'm not exactly. You see, I was sewing on this dress, and Gilligan just came -- Skipper hands Mary Ann the bouquet of flowers. SKIPPER Here, ma'am. I picked these for you down at the corral. She accepts them. MARY ANN Corral? GILLIGAN Is that anywhere near the Casbah? Skipper turns and sees Gilligan. SKIPPER Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. Pardon me. I thought you was alone. (to Gilligan) Howdy, partner! A knock at the door. MARY ANN Oh, come in. Professor opens the door and enters with his own bouquet of violet and yellow flowers. He embraces Mary Ann and slightly dips her. PROFESSOR Mary Ann, Mary Ann, Mary Ann. MARY ANN Professor! PROFESSOR Just a minute, I've got a few more "Mary Anns." He pulls her upright and releases his embrace. PROFESSOR (cont'd) First, I want you to put these into a vase. He adds his bouquet to the other two held by Mary Ann. MARY ANN I see you've been down to the corral, too. Professor gives her a one-armed hug around her shoulders. PROFESSOR Corral? Why, my dear, you do have a sense of humor. (re: Gilligan and Skipper) And what have we here? MARY ANN Oh, that's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. PROFESSOR My dear, they're not good enough for you. Not half good enough. GILLIGAN That is not true, you -- you -- limey. Professor releases Mary Ann and takes an awkward fighting stance toward Gilligan and Skipper. PROFESSOR Limey, eh? Why, I've got half a mind to teach you a lesson. Gilligan grabs a small broom from the sewing table and mock fences with Professor. GILLIGAN It's a duel you want, huh? En garde! Skipper moves in between Gilligan and Professor and holds them apart. SKIPPER Now, wait a minute, you two. I don't advise no fighting around here while I'm here. GILLIGAN Stay out of this, Sheriff John. Gilligan uses the small broom to strike Skipper in the belly. Mary Ann tosses all three bouquets into the air, opens the door, and runs out of the hut. MARY ANN They've flipped! They've gone stark raving mad! INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Mr. Howell sits on Mrs. Howell's bed. Mrs. Howell holds a dress. Ginger examines the dress. Mary Ann calls to them from outside. MARY ANN (O.S.) Oh, Mister Howell, Missus Howell! MR HOWELL Come in, child. Mary Ann opens the door and enters. MARY ANN Oh, Mister Howell, you've got to help. It's Gilligan, Skipper, and the Professor. They've gone island happy! Oh, you've got to help me, please. She tugs at Mr. Howell's arm. MR HOWELL Let's just discuss this calmly, my dear. MARY ANN Oh, you girls have got to hide. In the closet, under a bed, in a trunk. Oh, please Mister Howell, hurry! GINGER What's wrong with you, Mary Ann? MARY ANN Oh, it's not me. It's them. MRS HOWELL Them? MARY ANN Oh, yes. You see, I was sewing on a dress, and Gilligan came in and he thought he was Charles Boyer. MRS HOWELL Oh, good for him! MARY ANN Oh, and then the Skipper came in and thought he was Matt Dillon, and he had a fight with Cary Grant. GINGER What a parlay. Next time you have a dream like that, send for me. MARY ANN But it wasn't a dream, Ginger. MR HOWELL They're just trying to make an impression on you, darling. MARY ANN They impressed me all right. They impressed me right out of my wits. MRS HOWELL Well, you'd better get right back there. Without feminine influences, no telling what they might do to each other. Mary Ann turns to exit. FLIP TO: EXT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Mary Ann approaches the girls hut from the outside. As she approaches, she overhears the men. SKIPPER (O.S.) How long we have to keep up this masquerade? Mary Ann backs away so she is not seen. PROFESSOR (O.S.) Well, I'm not sure. A young girl like Mary Ann, I'd give her about a week. SKIPPER (O.S.) Poor kid. I wish there was an easier way to tell her. INT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Still dressed as Charles Boyer, Marshal Matt Dillon, and Cary Grant, the men discuss Mary Ann. Professor stands with his arms folded across his chest. GILLIGAN Same thing happened to a friend of my sister's. PROFESSOR How long did it take her to get over it? GILLIGAN She never recovered. EXT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Mary Ann drops her jaw. SKIPPER (O.S.) Poor Mary Ann. MARY ANN Oh. Mushrooms. They were poisonous. Oh, no wonder they're being so nice to me.

I overheard the Professor talking to both of you about it. Skipper stands. SKIPPER Oh, that's wonderful, Mary Ann. You're quite a girl for taking it so calmly. GILLIGAN We thought you'd like cry and stamp your feet and everything. MARY ANN I decided to be brave. SKIPPER Good girl. You might just as well make the best of it. MARY ANN Huh? GILLIGAN Yeah. It'll all be over in a little while. MARY ANN Oh. GILLIGAN Let's go tell the others. They'll be real happy she's taking it like a man, considering she's a girl. Gilligan guides Mary Ann away from the dining table. Skipper shakes his head. INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell recline on Mr. Howell's bed. Mr. Howell holds a bamboo drinking glass with a straw and flower sticking out. GILLIGAN (O.S.) Mister and Missus Howell -- Gilligan opens the doors to the Howells hut. Gilligan barges in to their hut. Mary Ann follows closely behind. GILLIGAN Wait till you hear the good news. Mary Ann knows, and she's calm as anything. Mary Ann nods. MRS HOWELL Oh, what a relief. Thurston, did you hear that? Now we can stop pretending. MR HOWELL Yes, Mary Ann, you have our sympathy, though I must say it's a small loss. MARY ANN (horrified) What? MRS HOWELL Thurston, must you be so blunt? MR HOWELL Well, it's not the end of the world. GILLIGAN Sure, this kind of thing happens every day. Mrs. Howell stands, walks over to Mary Ann and attempts to comfort her. MRS HOWELL Yes, dear. We cry a little and then we forget. Mr. Howell places his bamboo glass on the night stand and stands. MR HOWELL I've got a good idea. Why don't we give a party to celebrate? I've been saving a bottle of bubbly, 1932 -- MARY ANN (tearfully) Oh, how can you all be so callous at a time like this? How can you think of giving in a party at a time like this? Mary Ann turns, heads for the door, and exits. MRS HOWELL Whatever's the matter with that poor little girl? MR HOWELL Well, I admit 1932 was a bad year, but to get so hysterical about it. She probably cries over a bad Crêpe Suzette. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GIRLS HUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT INT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Mary Ann lies in her bed. Her head rests on pillows as she begins dreaming. The men's words repeat in her head. PROFESSOR (V.O.) Ah, the poor girl. I'll give her a week. Maybe less. SKIPPER (V.O.) It would break my heart to have to tell her. Mary Ann changes position. Her dreams disturb her sleep. GILLIGAN (V.O.) Same thing happened to a friend of my sister's. She never recovered. Never recovered. Never recovered. SKIPPER (V.O.) She's so sweet and innocent. GILLIGAN (V.O.) Never recovered. Mary Ann's face twitches. PROFESSOR (V.O.) You can't be sure about mushrooms. They might be poisonous. GILLIGAN (V.O.) Never recovered. PROFESSOR (V.O.) Mushrooms. SKIPPER (V.O.) She's so sweet and innocent. GILLIGAN (V.O.) Never recovered. RIPPLE MATCH DISSOLVE TO: DREAM SEQUENCE - INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY Mary Ann lies in a hospital bed. She wakes in her dream. Her eyes open and she looks around. She sits up, holding the sheet closely. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Where am I? Mary Ann reaches for, and finds the call button to contact a nurse. She speaks into the microphone. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER (cont'd) Nurse? Nurse? Nurse! Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth enters. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH Did you ring, my dear? MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER What am I doing in the hospital? What's wrong with me? Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth closes the door. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to tell a patient with a fatal disease what's wrong with them. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER You mean I have a fatal disease? MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH Wherever did you get that idea? MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER From you. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH Oh, no wonder all the nurses call me Miss Blabbermouth. Mary Ann lies back on the bed. A KNOCK at the door. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH (cont'd) Come in. The door opens. Mr. Howell/Dr. Zorbagalespie enters. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Ah, good morning, Nurse. He closes the door behind him. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH Good morning, Doctor. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Great day to be alive. (glances at Mary Ann) For some of us, that is. Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth laughs. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH You're always a million laughs, Doctor. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Thank you. And who have we here? Mr. Howell/Dr. Zorbagalespie folds his arms across his chest. Mary Ann still tightly holds the sheet. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER I'm Mary Ann. Who are you? MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE I'm kindly Doctor Zorbagalespie, lovable Chief of Staff, that's who -- inquisitive little creature, isn't she? Mr. Howell/Dr. Zorbagalespie moves to the foot of the bed. He reviews her chart. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE (cont'd) "Mary Ann Frobersher." MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH That's who she was, all right. Mary Ann sits up. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER "Was"? MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE You must be the one they call Miss Blabbermouth. Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth grins gleefully. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE (cont'd) Well, this doesn't look too bad. The unlabeled chart has a grid and a jagged line that increases from left-to-right. Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth turns the chart 90 degrees. The chart shows a jagged line that decreases from left-to-right. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE (cont'd) Oh, yes, yes. Ooh. Ooh. (whistles) Ha-ha. Wowie! Whoo! Ooh. Well, there's nothing to worry about, my dear. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER I have a feeling that you're hiding something from me. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Nonsense! Mary Ann lies back down. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE (cont'd) (sotto, to Nurse Blabbermouth) This room will be available this afternoon. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH Shall we charge her for the full day? Mary Ann sits up. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Please, I have to see old Doctor Young. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Well, you can't see old Doctor Young. He's on another case. He can't be bothered. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Bothered? But I'm gonna die! MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Well, that's exactly the sort of thing that bothers him. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Nurse, let me see young Doctor Young. I'm awfully sick. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH My dear, this is a hospital. We have more important things to do than take care of sick people. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER "More important"? Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth removes a small mirror from her pocket, looks into it, and primps her hair. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH We're preparing a tee vee series. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Oh, please, I've gotta see somebody. Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth places the mirror back into her pocket. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Yes, and so you shall, my dear. You shall indeed. We are flying in -- at no expense to us mind you, but a bundle to you -- three of the most important surgeons in the world. (to Nurse Blabbermouth) Mustn't keep them waiting, my dear. MRS HOWELL/NURSE BLABBERMOUTH I'll send them in the moment they arrive, Doctor. Mrs. Howell/Nurse Blabbermouth exits and closes the door behind her. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE I, Miss Frobersher, shall make other arrangements. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER "Other arrangements"? MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE The next of kin and who rides with the family. Mary Ann lies back on the bed. Mr. Howell/Dr. Zorbagalespie opens the door to discover Gilligan/Dr. Boyer outside. Gilligan/Dr. Boyer wears a surgical mask and gown. With a beret and a thin mustache. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE (cont'd) Oh, so nice to see you, Doctor -- Doctor, uh -- Mr. Howell/Dr. Zorbagalespie pulls down Gilligan's/Dr. Boyer's mask to recognize him. MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE (cont'd) Doctor Boyer! GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Please, I do not have time for the chitchat, Doctor. I, uh -- hope I have not arrived too late, huh? MR HOWELL/DOCTOR ZORBAGALESPIE Of course, of course. The services won't be until tomorrow. Mr. Howell/Dr. Zorbagalespie exits. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Miss Frobersher, neither the wind nor the rain, nor the dark of night could keep me from your side. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Isn't that what the mailmen say? GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER (in French) Oui. I graduated from a correspondence school. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Doctor, you've got to tell me the truth, please. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER First, I take the pulse, huh? Gilligan/Doctor Boyer checks Mary Ann's wrist for a pulse. Not finding one, he moves up her forearm, and then up to her shoulder. Mary Ann pulls her arm away from Gilligan and turns away from him. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER (cont'd) Oh, well. Gilligan/Doctor Boyer pulls the sheet over Mary Ann. Mary Ann pushes the sheet back down. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER But, Doctor, I'm still alive! GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Please, when I make a diagnosis, it's final. Gilligan/Doctor Boyer pulls the sheet over Mary Ann again. Mary Ann pushes the sheet back down. Gilligan/Doctor Boyer pulls the sheet over Mary Ann again. Mary Ann pushes the sheet back down. After a brief pause, Mary Ann pulls the sheet up over herself. Gilligan/Doctor Boyer pulls the sheet down. Mary Ann pulls the sheet up. Gilligan/Doctor Boyer pulls the sheet down. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER (cont'd) Hey, something is wrong. A knock at the door. Gilligan/Doctor Boyer walks over to the door and opens it. Skipper/Doctor Dillon stands there. His face is covered with a surgical mask, but looks like a villain from a Western movie, but with a gray cowboy hat. On his surgical gown a starfish sits where a badge should be. A belt holds holsters. Skipper/Dr. Dillon rests his hands on his holstered guns. Gilligan/Doctor Boyer puts his hands up as if her were held up. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON Put your hands down, partner. It's me. Skipper/Doctor Dillon pulls the surgical mask down. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Oh, it's old Doc Dillon, specialist from the West. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON Where's this sick filly? GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Right this way, Doctor. Gilligan/Dr. Boyer closes the door. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON Well, sorry, ma'am. Got here as soon as I could. A HORSE WHINNIES. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER You came by horse? SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON Well, that's what slowed me down a little. You see, I got a ticket on the freeway--for attracting flies. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Doctor, this is a very sick girl. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON Well, I'll have this case diagnosed in no time. Let me see what it says here on the last roundup. Well, now. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON'S HAND feels the bed frame. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON (cont'd) We got a broken fetlock. BACK TO SCENE Mary Ann sits up. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Doctor, that's the bedpost. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Don't listen to her. She thinks she knows everything. Exasperated, Mary Ann lies back down. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Come in, please! The door opens and Professor/Dr. Grant enters. He walks over to Gilligan. PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT Dear, dear, dear, you look awful. Gilligan/Dr. Boyer looks back quizzically. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON Oh, he ain't the patient. Professor/Dr. Grant turns to Skipper/Dr. Dillon. PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT Why, you look even worse. Mary Ann sits up. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER I'm the patient! Professor/Dr. Grant moves to Mary Ann's bedside. PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT Oh, well, stick out your tongue. As instructed, Mary Ann sticks out her tongue and faces Professor/Dr. Grant. Professor/Dr. Grant turns her head and looks in her ear. PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT (cont'd) Ah, yes. Well, I think we're going to have to operate. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Operate? What have I got? PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT Well, you've got a severe case of roomis igloomis. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER That is what you have, all right. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER What is roomis igloomis? PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT It's a medical term, my dear. No concern of yours. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Oh, but I'm the one who's got it. PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT Well, if you insist upon knowing -- "igooomis" is from the Eskimo word "igooo," meaning "mush." "Roomis" is from the Latin word "motel" meaning "vacancy" -- or in the layman's tongue, "room." Therefore, roomis igloomis. "mush room." MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Mush room. Mushrooms! I ate poison mushrooms! GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER That is the only way to catch roomis igloomis. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON Well, let's get on with the operation. I got to get back to a sick calf. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER I will ring for the operating nurse. Where is the ringer? Huh? Gilligan/Dr. Boyer looks for the ringer at the side of Mary Ann's bed. GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER (cont'd) The ringer? Huh? Ringer? Ginger/Nurse enters and doesn't completely close the door behind her. GINGER/NURSE You rang, Doctor? GILLIGAN/DOCTOR BOYER Not yet. (turns to Ginger) Oh, this kind of nurse is my kind of nurse. Professor/Dr. Grant rushes to the other side of Ginger/Nurse. PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT Now, see here, Doctor! We haven't got time for tomfoolery. GINGER/NURSE Oh, yes, we do. I've got time for Tom Foolery, Dick, and Harry Foolery, too. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON We got to prepare for an operation. Where can we find a kitchen table? PROFESSOR/DOCTOR GRANT Just a minute. We've got to scrub up. Nurse, where do we go to scrub up? GINGER/NURSE Walk this way, gentlemen. Ginger/Nurse walks over to a partition at one side of the room. She sexily walks and moves the partition to reveal three scrub sinks. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON We'll try and walk that way, ma'am, but I don't think we'll make it. Ginger/Nurse waves the doctors over to the sinks. The doctors scramble with Skipper/Dr. Dillon barely holding the other two back. SKIPPER/DOCTOR DILLON (cont'd) No stampeding, now. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Oh, isn't anybody gonna pay any attention to me? I'm the one who's sick! Ginger/Nurse walks over to Mary Ann's bed. She removes a covering from the operating instrument tray to reveal an assortment of primitive, but still modern, operating tools. Mary Ann lies back on the bed. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER (cont'd) Oh. Please. Please, somebody help me. Ginger/Nurse moves closer to Mary Ann and puts her hands on Mary Ann's shoulders. GINGER/NURSE I'll help you, honey. MARY ANN/MARY ANN FROBERSHER Oh. Get old Doctor Young or young Doctor Young! I'm too young to die. Oh, please help me. GINGER/NURSE Take it easy, you're gonna be all right. You're gonna be fine. Take it easy. END DREAM SEQUENCE. RIPPLE MATCH DISSOLVE TO: INT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Mary Ann sleeps in her bed. Skipper, Gilligan, and Professor stand at her bedside. Ginger sits on the edge of the bed and tries to rouse her by gently shaking her shoulders. GINGER Wake up. Wake up, honey. It's only a bad dream. Wake up. Mary Ann opens her eyes and sits up. MARY ANN Where am I? GINGER You were having a dream. Pretty bad one from the way you were yelling. MARY ANN Oh, it wasn't a dream, Ginger. I ate some poison mushrooms. PROFESSOR That's why you had a nightmare. Mary Ann, those mushrooms weren't poisonous. MARY ANN Well, why were the three of you so nice to me? Gilligan leans over to get closer to Mary Ann. He rests his arms on his legs. GILLIGAN You know. To make you forget Horace Higgenbothum. MARY ANN Horace? What's he got to do with it? GILLIGAN He got married. MARY ANN Horace Higgenbothum got married? Oh, the poor girl. GINGER "Poor girl"? MARY ANN Oh, Ginger, Horace is a real creep. GILLIGAN How come all those letters, all the ones I mailed? Gilligan motions like throwing a message in a bottle into the ocean. MARY ANN I'm sorry about that, Gilligan. I guess I acted sort of foolish. Well, you see, Ginger has so many boyfriends, and Missus Howell has Mister Howell, and I just wanted somebody to think I had someone. So I invented a romance. GILLIGAN We all care for you. SKIPPER Well, certainly. You didn't have to scare us half to death to make us prove it. MARY ANN Oh, I guess you think I'm pretty silly, huh? Gilligan stands up fully. GILLIGAN Silly? Just because you write a letter, and address it to a guy you hardly know, and stuff it in a bottle, and throw it in the ocean? Who would call that silly? Gilligan and Skipper raise their hands. Ginger raises her hand. Professor follows suit. Finally, Mary Ann also raises her hand. They all laugh. FADE OUT END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. BOYS HUT - DAY Gilligan sits at a small table cutting vegetables. A bowl with other vegetables sits on the table. Next to Gilligan sits a smaller table. On the smaller table rests a book. Skipper holds a bowl with vegetables and tends a pot over a fire. Skipper spoons vegetables into the pot. Mary Ann appears from around the end of the hut. MARY ANN Hi, boys. What's for dinner? SKIPPER Hi, Mary Ann. Mushrooms. Skipper winks at Gilligan. MARY ANN What?! SKIPPER Oh, we're just kidding you, Mary Ann. I guess it'll be a long time before you'll eat another mushroom. MARY ANN Boy, you can say that again. SKIPPER It'll be a long time before -- Skipper laughs heartily and hugs Mary Ann with one arm. GILLIGAN You don't have to worry about mushrooms any more. I got a book that tells all about them. SKIPPER You do? GILLIGAN Uh-huh, yeah, and it's called, "How to Tell a Mushroom from a Toadstool" by the late Doctor Morton Keptstoned. Skipper and Mary Ann look at each other. MARY ANN "The late"? SKIPPER "The late"? Gilligan looks closer at the book. GILLIGAN "The late"? Gilligan looks back at Skipper and Mary Ann.

Episode #13, “Three Million Dollars More or Less” Everybody wants a piece of Gilligan and his newfound riches after he wins a three million dollar bet with Mr. Howell.  “Three Million Dollars More or Less”  By  Bill Davenport  and  Charles Tannen  December 26, 1964  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan practices his golf swing on the lagoon beach. Bamboo sawhorses, poles and pieces of the yet-to-be assembled watchtower are strewn about. A hammer rests on one of the sawhorses. Gilligan swings his club at the ball, twirls completely around, and falls to the ground in a heap. Gilligan gets up, dusts himself off, and lines up his next swing. Gilligan back swings and notices Skipper standing nearby with his arms folded over his chest. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. SKIPPER What are you doing, Gilligan? GILLIGAN Uh, Mister Howell was teaching me how to play golf and he even gave me this club to use. Skipper picks up the hammer lying on the sawhorse. SKIPPER And I gave you this hammer to use. GILLIGAN Oh, I just took time out to practice my driving. SKIPPER Well, if you'd like to practice your driving, Gilligan -- (angrily) -- start on those nails! Gilligan hands the golf club to Skipper while taking the hammer from Skipper. Gilligan runs over to the watchtower project. SKIPPER (cont'd) I want that watchtower finished by tonight. GILLIGAN Why the big rush? Because you dreamed a ship will go by the island? SKIPPER Don't forget, Gilligan, this is the third night in a row I've had that dream. Gilligan kneels down next to a bamboo brace and pulls a string tightly into a knot. GILLIGAN Oh, come on, Skipper. You don't believe in dreams. SKIPPER And what's more, this is the third day of the week of the third month. With all those threes coming up, are you gonna tell me that I'm wrong? Gilligan stands up. GILLIGAN No, sir. I won't tell you you're wrong, 'cause you're three times bigger than I am. SKIPPER Okay, then. Get to work. Now really, Gilligan, when I have these dreams, they always come true. GILLIGAN Well, not always, Skipper. How about the time you dreamed I was gonna hit you in the jaw? SKIPPER Well? GILLIGAN I wouldn't do a thing like that. That'd be mutiny. SKIPPER Yeah. Skipper laughs. GILLIGAN Not only that, it'd be suicide. SKIPPER I forgot about that one. Skipper laughs again. GILLIGAN You see, Skipper, there's nothing to those dreams. Gilligan hands Skipper the hammer and takes the golf club. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Here, watch my practice swing and tell me what I'm doing wrong. SKIPPER Hmmm. All right, Gilligan. Skipper moves behind Gilligan to watch his swing. GILLIGAN Head down, left arm stiff, keep your eye on the ball. Gilligan swings his club back and hits Skipper with a SMACK. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Was that you, Skipper? SKIPPER Uh-huh. GILLIGAN Where'd I hit you? SKIPPER Right in the jaw. GILLIGAN Just like you dreamed, huh? SKIPPER Yup, just like I dreamed. GILLIGAN Well, I better get back to work. That ship could be coming by any minute. Skipper breaks the golf club over his knee. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY Ocean waves hit the beach. EXT. PUTTING GREEN - DAY Mr. Howell hunches over, lining up a putt on the putting green. Mrs. Howell watches from the side. Mr. Howell's hat sits on her lap. Mr. Howell sinks a putt of a few inches. Mr. Howell fishes the ball out of the hole and kisses it. MR HOWELL I never thought I'd make that one. What did I get on the hole, dear? Mr. Howell picks up his hat from Mrs. Howell's lap and wears it like the proud golfer he is. MRS HOWELL Now, let me see. Three, four -- You did much better this time, darling. You got a thirty four. MR HOWELL Thirty four? I finally parred the hole. MRS HOWELL I'm so happy for you. Are you going to play another round? MR HOWELL No, I think I'll practice a little. This oyster-shell putter doesn't feel right. MRS HOWELL Of course it doesn't. There's no "r" in the month. I'll see you back at the hut, dear. Mrs. Howell exits. Mr. Howell approaches his ball on the putting green. He looks around to see if he is observed. He moves the ball closer to the hole. As Mr. Howell swings his putter, Gilligan carries the brace from the watchtower and passes behind Mr. Howell. GILLIGAN Hi, Mister Howell. Mr. Howell completely misses the ball. MR HOWELL Look, Gilligan, never talk when a man is putting. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL Yes, that's perfectly all right. It's all right. GILLIGAN Just wanted to say hello. MR HOWELL Look, go stand over there, will you? Mr. Howell motions to Gilligan to stand behind him. Gilligan moves. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Putting is the hardest part of the game. It requires the utmost (yells) silence! Mr. Howell turns around and positions himself to putt. GILLIGAN (whispers) I won't say another word. MR HOWELL (frustrated) Gilligan. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, but I don't see what's so tough about it, though. MR HOWELL You don't see what's so tough about it? Well, you just try it. Just go head. Try it. Mr. Howell tries to give the putter to Gilligan. GILLIGAN I'd better not. The Skipper told me -- MR HOWELL I don't care what the Skipper says. Go ahead, putt. Mr. Howell tries to give the putter to Gilligan again. This time Gilligan accepts it. MR HOWELL (cont'd) So easy. Putt. Gilligan putts while still holding onto the brace with his other arm. The ball goes down the putting green, swings completely around the hole, and drops in. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Well, that was just beginner's luck. Mr. Howell retrieves the ball from the hole and carries it back. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Besides, I wasn't talking while you were putting, my boy. Mr. Howell places the ball for Gilligan to putt again. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Yes, you just try putting while someone is saying something stupid, like: "Hello, Mister Howell." "Sorry, Mister Howell." "Looks easy to me, Mister Howell." Has this thing on his shoulder. Stomp, stomp, stomp. You just try putting while I'm talking. Go ahead, putt while I'm talking. Go ahead. Putt, putt, putt. GILLIGAN I did. MR HOWELL Where's the ball? GILLIGAN/MR HOWELL In the hole. Mr. Howell retrieves the ball from the hole. MR HOWELL All right, well, that's two lucky breaks. That doesn't mean a darn thing. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna bet you anything you can't do it again. GILLIGAN All I got is a quarter, Mister Howell. Mr. Howell puts the ball down in front of Gilligan again. Mr. Howell pushes the ball into the green to make it harder to hit. MR HOWELL All right, that's good. Yeah, when you're putting with money, there's pressure. There's pressure. There. Try putting when you're -- Gilligan swings the putter. GOLF BALL sinks in hole. Mr. Howell is dumbfounded. GILLIGAN I'll see you later, Mister Howell. I've got to get this over to the tower. Gilligan moves to leave, but Mr. Howell stops him by grabbing onto the brace. They spin around completely. MR HOWELL Oh, no you don't. Absolutely not. You've got to give me a chance to get my money back. GILLIGAN But the Skipper told me -- MR HOWELL I don't care what the Skipper told you. All right now, this one. Double or nothing. Ha ha. The pressure. This one is for fifty cents. GILLIGAN 0kay. Gilligan putts. GOLF BALL sinks in hole. Mr. Howell is increasingly irritated. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Now can I go, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL (angrily) I'll tell you when to go. (annoyed) Young man, I think your luck is running out. This one's for one dollar. Gilligan putts. The ball drops in the hole. MR HOWELL (cont'd) (resigned) Two dollars says says I'm right. FLIP TO: EXT. PUTTING GREEN - NIGHT Mr. Howell holds a torch so he and Gilligan can see the putting green and the hole. Mr. Howell holds the ball up to Gilligan's face so he can see it in the darkness. MR HOWELL Come on, Gilligan, and putt. GILLIGAN But I can't see the hole. MR HOWELL Well, I can see it. Double or nothing. Mr. Howell bends down and places the ball. The torch comes dangerously close to Gilligan and he recoils. GILLIGAN I ought to be going, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL You're not going anywhere. Nobody hustles me on a golf course. GILLIGAN But you said we could quit at ten thirty. MR HOWELL Will you stop watching the clock, and putt? Gilligan putts. Mr. Howell grasps the torch firmly and walks toward the hole. The ball drops into the hole with a crunch. GILLIGAN Oh. I'm sorry, Mister Howell, but I think I did it again. MR HOWELL Cut out the chatter, will you, Gilligan? GILLIGAN We'll be out here all night. MR HOWELL I'll light the hole. Come on, putt. GILLIGAN Wonder what the Skipper's gonna say. Gilligan turns around to find the Skipper standing there with his own torch. SKIPPER (angrily) I'll tell you what he's going to say! GILLIGAN Never mind, Skipper. I think I can guess. MR HOWELL Captain, will you please get off the putting green? Gilligan and I have a little bet. SKIPPER A bet? Gilligan, what have I told you about gambling? GILLIGAN I know, Skipper. But I only bet a quarter, and I won. Skipper pulls Gilligan aside to the edge of the putting green. SKIPPER Don't you realize that's the worst thing that could've happened to you? GILLIGAN It is? SKIPPER Why, certainly. You'd have been better off if you had lost the twenty-five cents. Mr. Howell joins them at the edge of the putting green. MR HOWELL Yes, I couldn't agree with you more, Captain. Come on, Gilligan, putt. SKIPPER Just a moment, Howell. This boy doesn't know what he's doing. Skipper pulls Gilligan to the other side of the putting green. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, I know exactly what's going on in your mind. GILLIGAN You do? SKIPPER Certainly. You've gotten a little ahead, and it looks a pretty easy way of making some money. Gilligan smiles broadly. GILLIGAN Sure does. SKIPPER Well, that's where you're wrong. How much do you think you can win gambling? GILLIGAN Six million dollars if I sink this putt. SKIPPER You see? A whole afternoon wasted, and for what? (double take) What?! GILLIGAN I already won three million dollars. We're playing double or nothing. SKIPPER Put that putter down, Gilligan. (to Mr. Howell) The game is over. MR HOWELL Just a moment, Captain. SKIPPER The game's over, Mister Howell. Frankly, I'm surprised. I didn't realize you were that sort of a man. MR HOWELL What sort of a man? SKIPPER The sort of a man who'd take advantage of this boy because he has a lot of money. Skipper puts his arm around Gilligan and they exit. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY Ocean waves crash on the beach. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - MORNING Professor tends to the campfire. Gilligan kneels next to him. PROFESSOR Why, I would love to have seen the look on Howell's face when you won all that money from him last night. GILLIGAN So would I, but it was too dark. Gilligan rises, puts his hand on Professor's shoulder. He nearly stumbles. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Watch the fire. It's hot. PROFESSOR Thanks, Gilligan. Gilligan walks past the community dining table. Ginger sits and holds a small scarf. GINGER Gilligan, come over here. Sit down right next to me. Mary Ann quickly sits down. MARY ANN And me. Oh, Gee, Gilligan, I'm so proud of you. You know what I'm going to do? Fix anything you like for breakfast. GINGER And I'll fix anything you like for lunch. GILLIGAN How come everybody's being so nice to me? GINGER Because you're so sweet -- MARY ANN Uh-huh. GINGER -- and tall -- MARY ANN Yes. GINGER -- and handsome. MARY ANN I'll say. GINGER There are lots of reasons. Skipper appears and disrupts their flattering of Gilligan. SKIPPER Yes, about three million of them. Come on, little buddy. Gilligan rises. SKIPPER (cont'd) I think we'd better have a little talk. Skipper moves away from the dining table. GILLIGAN Okay, Skipper. Gilligan looks at the girls and begins to sit back down. SKIPPER Gilligan! Gilligan stands and exits. INT. BOYS HUT - MORNING Skipper waits inside as Gilligan enters. GILLIGAN Did I do something wrong, Skipper? SKIPPER Of course not. Sit down. Skipper motions to a chair. SKIPPER (cont'd) Here, take my chair. Gilligan sits on Skipper's chair. GILLIGAN What do you want to talk to me about, Skipper? Skipper sits on a different chair. SKIPPER Gilligan, you've never had three million dollars before, have you? Gilligan thinks for a moment. GILLIGAN No, sir, I haven't. SKIPPER I didn't think so. Let me tell you something. You're gonna find a big change in some of the people around here. GILLIGAN What do you mean? Skipper rises from the chair. SKIPPER Well, take this morning, for example. Number one: the Professor never offered to build you a fire before, right? GILLIGAN Right. SKIPPER Number two: Mary Ann never offered to fix you a special breakfast before, right? GILLIGAN Right. SKIPPER Number three: Ginger never offered to fix you lunch before, right? GILLIGAN Right. What about number four? SKIPPER Four? Number four? GILLIGAN Yeah. I never sat in your chair before, right? SKIPPER Right. (gently) Believe me, it won't be the last time. Little buddy, anytime that you have a problem, I want you to come in this hut, sit in my chair, and tell your Skipper all about it. GILLIGAN Tell you all about what? SKIPPER Anything that you're worried about. Gilligan stands up. GILLIGAN Skipper, I'm not worried about anything. MR. HOWELL APPEARS AT THE WINDOW Mr. Howell eavesdrops on their conversation. SKIPPER (O.S.) But that's impossible. Anyone with three million dollars-- (sotto) Anyone with three million dollars has got to be worried about something. GILLIGAN (O.S.) Skipper, I don't have it yet. Mister Howell just owes it to me. SKIPPER (O.S.) Well, I wouldn't worry about that. I'm gonna go out right now and get you a check for three million dollars. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN Oh, Skipper, you don't have to go to all that trouble. SKIPPER It's no trouble. That's what I'm here for-- (paternally) son. Gilligan is surprised at Skipper's endearing language. GILLIGAN "Son"? SKIPPER Gilligan, that's the way I've always felt about you. You've been like my own boy to me. GILLIGAN I have? Gosh, I didn't know that, Skipper. SKIPPER Skipper? Why don't you just call me "Dad?" Skipper puts his hand on Gilligan's shoulder. GILLIGAN Okay, Skipper. Skipper removes his hand from Gilligan's shoulder and gives him a whack. SKIPPER (angrily) I told you to call me "Dad" and that's an order! Gilligan salutes. GILLIGAN Yes, sir. "Dad." Skipper laughs at himself. SKIPPER That's better. Skipper pushes Gilligan back down onto the chair. SKIPPER (cont'd) And now I'll go out and find Mister Howell and get you your money. And, son, I don't want you to leave this hut. GILLIGAN But Mary Ann said she's gonna fix me breakfast. SKIPPER Your father will fix you breakfast when he gets back. Skipper runs into the beam over the hut door. GILLIGAN Watch the beam -- Dad. SKIPPER Thanks a lot -- son. Skipper exits. EXT. CAMP - MORNING Skipper exits the boys hut and walks across the camp clearing. Mr. Howell enters the boys hut. Mr. Howell carries a briefcase. INT. BOYS HUT - MORNING Mr. Howell, dressed in his finest southern gentleman attire, carries his briefcase. His jacket pocket contains several pens. MR HOWELL Ah, good morning, Gilligan. Is the uh -- is the Captain in? Mr. Howell removes his hat and places it on one of the chairs. GILLIGAN No. He's out looking for you. Mr. Howell sets the briefcase on a chair. MR HOWELL Oh, I'm sorry I missed him. I just stopped by to pay my debt to give you a check for the three million dollars that I -- Gilligan reaches for the check, but Mr. Howell pulls it out of reach. Gilligan falls on the ground. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Olé. And it's made out. Mr. Howell sits in the Skipper's chair. MR HOWELL (cont'd) But first of all, you have to fill out an income tax form. GILLIGAN Income tax form? Mr. Howell removes the income tax form from his pocket and places it on the table. The form is multiple pages and looks quite imposing. MR HOWELL Yes, I didn't know what your salary was and I was afraid that three million dollars might kick you into a higher income bracket. You know what I mean? GILLIGAN What's this form to fill out? MR HOWELL Well, I'd be glad to help you. First you have to list all your dependents. Do you have a wife or children? Do you have a wife, children? GILLIGAN No, but I got a father about five minutes ago. Mr. Howell opens up the income tax form, accordion style. MR HOWELL What is wrong with me? This is the wrong paper. This is the short form. Gilligan grasps the income tax form. GILLIGAN There's a longer form? Mr. Howell rises from Skipper's chair. MR HOWELL Yes, there's a much longer form. That's so you can put your money in your corporate structure. Gilligan sits down in Skipper's chair. GILLIGAN I thought I'd just put it in my wallet. Mr. Howell puts his briefcase on the table. It lands on Gilligan's hand and he exclaims in pain. Mr. Howell releases Gilligan's hand from under the briefcase and sits down next to him. MR HOWELL No. No, with three million dollars, my boy, you have got to get yourself a tax shelter. Gilligan looks around. GILLIGAN What's the matter with this place? MR HOWELL Gilligan, I don't believe you know what this money could do to you. GILLIGAN So far it's gotten me breakfast, lunch, and the Skipper's chair. MR HOWELL You're terribly naive about financial matters. You don't want this money. GILLIGAN I don't? MR HOWELL No, you'd be much better off, instead of the three million dollars, if I gave you one of my corporations. GILLIGAN Oh, I couldn't ask you to do a thing like that, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL Believe me, we millionaires have to stick together. Why didn't you tell me you were in such bad shape? GILLIGAN I'm not in bad shape. I'm just a little tired. You kept me up pretty late last night. Mr. Howell opens the briefcase. The deed for the Tehachapuku Oil and Mining Corporation sits on top of the other papers in the briefcase. MR HOWELL Oh, I just happen to have it. This is the corporation for you. "Tehachapuku Oil and Mining Corporation." My boy, do you know anything about oil? GILLIGAN No, but I worked in a gas station once. MR HOWELL It's the American way: from grease monkey to president of an oil company. Just goes to show what a man can do if he has a little drive. GILLIGAN He can do pretty good if he knows how to putt, too. They laugh. Mr. Howell closes the briefcase and it captures Gilligan's hand. Gilligan exclaims in pain. Gilligan opens the briefcase with his other hand just far enough to remove his injured hand. The briefcase closes again. Gilligan rubs his fingers. MR HOWELL You oil men -- you have such a wonderful sense of humor. Now, if you just -- (acknowledging Gilligan's injury) It smarts. GILLIGAN Yeah. Mr. Howell places the deed on the closed briefcase and hands Gilligan a pen to sign it. MR HOWELL You just sign right here. There you are. GILLIGAN Do you think I really ought to do this, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL Believe me, it's the only solution. At least, the only one I can come up with. Gilligan signs the deed. MR HOWELL (cont'd) There you go. GILLIGAN That's all there is to it? Mr. Howell takes the pen from Gilligan, moves to place it back into his pocket, but has a second thought. MR HOWELL That's all. Simple transfer of all--. You can have the pen. Skipper enters the hut. SKIPPER I can't find that-- Skipper sees Mr. Howell in the hut with Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) Oh, here you are. MR HOWELL Yes, I just stopped by to settle my debt with Gilligan. Gilligan smiles and nods. SKIPPER Fine, Mister Howell. I hope you'll accept my apology. MR HOWELL Apology? Apology for what? SKIPPER For all the things I said about you while I was looking for you. Skipper elbow's Mr. Howell in the ribs. SKIPPER (cont'd) Well, I guess we better put Mister Howell's check in a safe place, eh, Gilligan. MR HOWELL Yes, I've already done that. It's right here in my pocket. GILLIGAN Mister Howell's saving me from getting stuck with three million dollars. SKIPPER What? GILLIGAN Instead of giving me money, he gave me an oil company. SKIPPER Why do you want an oil company? GILLIGAN Well, Mister Howell can explain it better than me. SKIPPER Yes, Howell. Start explaining. Mr. Howell picks up his briefcase. MR HOWELL Well, you see, I -- uh -- settled the debt by giving Gilligan one of my oil companies. GILLIGAN Yeah. Gilligan picks up the deed and reads it. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I'm president of the (struggles with pronunciation) Tehachapuku Oil and Mining Corporation. Skipper takes the deed from Gilligan. SKIPPER "Tehachapuku Oil and Mining?" What is that? MR HOWELL Well, that's two hundred acres of land in Dust Bowl, Oklahoma. SKIPPER Dust Bowl? I never heard of it. What part of Oklahoma is that in? MR HOWELL Well, sometimes it's north, and sometimes it's south. It depends upon which way the wind is blowing. SKIPPER In other words, Gilligan here is the proud owner of a worthless oil company. MR HOWELL What do you mean "worthless"? I got three million dollars for it. Ha! Mr. Howell exits. GILLIGAN I guess I didn't do such a smart thing, huh? SKIPPER I'm afraid not. Skipper throws the deed down onto the table. GILLIGAN Well, what's our next move? SKIPPER (angrily) Your next move is to get out of my chair, Gilligan. Gilligan stands up. GILLIGAN Okay, Dad. SKIPPER "Skipper," Gilligan, "Skipper." Skipper sits down in his chair. Gilligan hands Mr. Howell's pen to Skipper. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY FOUR TALL PALM TREES DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - LATE MORNING The castaways sit at the dining table, except for Gilligan, who sits on a small stool and stirs the content of a deep pan on the campfire. A small supply of firewood lies next to the campfire. Mary Ann faces away from the table. The castaway's radio lies quietly. SKIPPER Gilligan, hurry up with that coffee. GILLIGAN Coming right up, Skipper. MR HOWELL Pass me those mango preserves, will you, Lovey my dear? Mrs. Howell passes a small container with bits of mango and sets it down on the table in front of Mr. Howell. Mr. Howell takes the container and removes pieces of mango. MRS HOWELL They're full of vitamins, darling. MR HOWELL Thank you. Mary Ann turns around to address Mr. Howell. MARY ANN Really, Mister Howell, I think you big businessmen are terrible. How can you eat a thing after what you've done to poor Gilligan? Mary Ann turns her back on Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL The lion always gorges itself after the kill. It's the nature of the beast. Mr. Howell picks up a piece of fruit and bites into it as if it were raw meat and he were a lion. SKIPPER I still say it was a dirty trick. Kid wakes up this morning, he's a millionaire. Look at him now, he's waiting on table. GINGER Yes, you really ought to be ashamed of yourself. MR HOWELL Well, don't blame me. I can't help it if the kid squandered his fortune on bad investments. PROFESSOR Yes, but you're the one that sold it to him. MR HOWELL I'm not known as the "Wizard of Wall Street" for nothing. MRS HOWELL Nobody gets the better of Thurston in a business deal. When it comes to making money, he seems to have a green thumb. SKIPPER All right, Mister Howell. If you're such a wheeler-dealer, how come you bought that phony oil property? MR HOWELL I didn't buy it. It was a wedding gift from Lovey's father. MRS HOWELL Thurston, you know how embarrassed Daddy was when he found out what "Dust Bowl, Oklahoma" really was. He thought he'd given us a football stadium. MR HOWELL Laughed at the wedding. Oh my, I almost forgot. It's time for the ten o'clock Wall Street news. Mr. Howell turns on the radio. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) -- and Industrials are up one point two over yesterday's close. Now for the big news on Wall Street today. Thurston Howell has done it again. MR HOWELL Well, good for him. Wait a minute, that's me. What have I done? RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) A huge oil strike has been reported on the Howell holdings in Dust Bowl, Oklahoma. Reports from the scene indicate this could be the richest oil field ever found in the state. However, as black gold gushes into the Oklahoma sky, everyone is asking the same question: Where is the man who owns the fabulous Tehachapuku 0il and Mining Company? Mr. Howell turns off the radio. SKIPPER I'll tell you where he is. He's right here, having a nice breakfast with his dad. Move over and make a little room for my boy, Howell. Skipper lifts one end of the bench Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell sit on. Mr. Howell slides off onto the ground. The other castaways gather around Gilligan to show him support. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY Waves crash on the empty beach. The sky is partly cloudy. INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper enters holding a bamboo shovel. He sets it down near the Window. Gilligan sits at the desk, writing on a piece of paper. SKIPPER Hello, son. Gilligan hides the piece of paper on which he'd been writing. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. Skipper set down the shovel near the door. SKIPPER (gently scolding) Uh-uh-ah. GILLIGAN I mean, hi, Dad. SKIPPER And what's my boy doing there? GILLIGAN Well, it's sort of a surprise. SKIPPER What kind of surprise? GILLIGAN Well, everybody's been so nice to me, I thought I'd take some of my money and buy them a present. SKIPPER That's very nice of you, Gilligan. Skipper walks over to a shelving unit with their island toiletries. He removes his cap and places it on one of the shelving unit's posts. Skipper splashes water from a basin onto his face. GILLIGAN Yeah, well, the Professor likes to experiment with stuff, so I thought I'd get him a science laboratory. Skipper, startled at Gilligan's pronouncement, hits his head on the upper shelf. SKIPPER Science laboratory? Gilligan stands up and walks over to Skipper. GILLIGAN Yeah. I wanted to buy him a tie, but I don't know if he wears one. And I want to get Mary Ann the biggest farm in Kansas. SKIPPER Now hold it, Gilligan. Those are pretty expensive gifts. GILLIGAN What good is having money if you can't do something nice for friends? Gilligan sits back down. SKIPPER But you don't have to spend a fortune doing it. Real friends don't care. It's not the gift that counts, it's the thought. By the way, had you thought about what you're going to get me? GILLIGAN Sure have. You get the best present of them all. SKIPPER Gilligan, I don't want you to spend a lot of money on me. GILLIGAN You don't? SKIPPER No, sir. Gilligan turns his pencil around and begins erasing words on the page. Skipper reaches to stop him. SKIPPER (cont'd) But of course, if you've already gotten it, I wouldn't want to take it back. What did you get me? GILLIGAN I can't tell. It's kind of a surprise. SKIPPER Aw, come on, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Nope. SKIPPER Not even a little hint? (angrily) Gilligan, what did you get me? GILLIGAN A boat. SKIPPER A boat? GILLIGAN A boat. SKIPPER You shouldn't have. GILLIGAN Well, I haven't yet. SKIPPER But you're gonna. GILLIGAN You bet I am. Gilligan stands up. SKIPPER What kind of a boat are you gonna get me? GILLIGAN I don't know, Skipper. How about one like the old Minnow? SKIPPER (angrily) What would I want with an old tub like that? GILLIGAN You can have any boat you want. I'm gonna get you lots of other presents, too. SKIPPER Gilligan, I don't know what to say. I better get out before I start bawling like a baby. Skipper walks over the shelving unit, picks up his cap and puts it on. GILLIGAN Are you all right, Skipper? SKIPPER It's just that I'm just a little choked up. GILLIGAN Maybe I better go with you, huh? SKIPPER No, you stay right here and finish that list. Oh, and another thing, Gilligan. I don't want those other vultures coming in here and taking advantage of you. So keep this door locked. GILLIGAN We don't have a lock. SKIPPER That's right. Don't let anybody in this hut, understand? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. SKIPPER And that's an order. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, Skipper. Gilligan salutes. Skipper salutes in return. SKIPPER Son. Skipper pats Gilligan on the back. Skipper exits. Gilligan turns around and walks over the shelving unit. GILLIGAN I think I'll buy Mary Ann the whole state of Kansas. Ginger enters without Gilligan seeing her. Gilligan writes on his paper using a shelf as a writing surface. Then he walks back toward the door tapping the paper with his pencil. Gilligan clumsily drops the pencil. It lands near Ginger's feet. GINGER (sultry) Anybody home, Gilligan? Gilligan looks Ginger up and down. He notices her dress says "S.S. Minnow" across her thigh. GILLIGAN "S. S. Minnow." Gilligan laughs uncomfortably. GINGER What's the matter? GILLIGAN New dress? GINGER Like it? I made it out of your duffel bag. I-- I hope you don't mind. GILLIGAN No, my duffel never looked so good. Skipper said nobody could come in here while he was gone. GINGER Oh, well, I-- I just wanted to talk to you. GILLIGAN Oh, let's go out there, huh? GINGER Okay. EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan and Ginger emerge from the hut. GINGER I know how busy you are with your oil wells and everything, but I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you. Ginger places her scarf around Gilligan's neck. GILLIGAN Oh, I'm not busy. GINGER I think it's absolutely thrilling the way you outsmarted Mister Howell. Ginger pulls Gilligan through a circle. GILLIGAN Oh-oh. It-- It was? GINGER Yes. I never dreamed you were so clever. GILLIGAN Neither did I. What did I do? Gilligan sits on the edge of the bathtub. GINGER Don't be so modest. Everyone knows that that land wasn't worth a cent until you took it over. You're a very remarkable man, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Yeah? GINGER Yeah. Gilligan falls into the bathtub. Ginger is startled, but kneels next to the tub. GINGER (cont'd) I think your life story would make a wonderful movie for some studio. GILLIGAN What studio would make a movie about me? GINGER Well, any studio you owned. Gilligan smiles. GINGER (cont'd) And you know what? GILLIGAN What? Ginger moves in, suggesting that she might kiss Gilligan. GINGER I'd just love to star in it. GILLIGAN But you don't look a thing like me. GINGER No, silly. We'd get Rock Hudson to play you. I'd play your wife. Ginger kisses her finger and moves to press it to Gilligan's lips. Gilligan submerges in the bathtub to escape the proxy kiss. Ginger rises and backs away. Gilligan rises from the bathtub. Soaking wet, Gilligan walks over to Ginger. GILLIGAN But I'm not even married. GINGER Well, you would be, if you looked like Rock Hudson. Ginger takes Gilligan's arm and walks toward the jungle. Mr. Howell enters from the jungle and intercepts them. MR HOWELL Ah, There you are, Gilligan. Please forgive me a moment, will you, Ginger? (pushes Ginger away) I just want to steal a little of Gilligan's time. Mr. Howell grasps Gilligan's arm and they exit into the jungle. Skipper enters from the jungle, with Gilligan in one arm and Mr. Howell in the other. SKIPPER I know what you want to steal, Howell, and you're not going to get away with it. MR HOWELL Well, I was merely inviting Gilligan to dinner. SKIPPER Oh, well, fine. We'd be glad to come. MR HOWELL You'll be there, too? SKIPPER I think I'd better be. MR HOWELL Fine, fine. Glad you can come. I thought you were standing watch duty tonight. Skipper moves Gilligan into the hut and closes the door. Gilligan looks out as if he's been given a jail sentence. SKIPPER Oh, I am, Mister Howell. In fact, I'm going to stand guard duty until I can get Gilligan off this island. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - SUNSET The sun is low in the sky, just above the horizon. DISSOLVE TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT The Howells have decorated their hut for their guests. A table covered with a tablecloth dominates the room. Mrs. Howell wears a fine dinner dress. Skipper's and Gilligan's hair is neatly combed. Skipper wears a lightweight spring jacket. Both of them show good manners by having removed their hats. Mr. Howell is dressed in a while tuxedo. MRS HOWELL It's so nice that you could come. We're delighted to have you. I'll have dinner ready in a few minutes. I'm just finishing the bananas. MR HOWELL All right, Lovey, my dear. Take all the time that you want. Skipper and Gilligan put their hats on. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Oh, oh, Gilligan, would you take a chair, please? Mr. Howell points Gilligan to a chair. Mr. Howell walks to the other side of the hut and shows a small stool for Skipper to sit on. MR HOWELL (cont'd) And, Captain, how's this chair for a man of your rather, shall we say -- Skipper sits on the chair beside Gilligan. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Are you both comfortable in that chair? SKIPPER No, but we're safe. MR HOWELL Say, that was some news we heard this afternoon on the radio, wasn't it? SKIPPER Sure was. Mr. Howell leans on the table. MR HOWELL Well, Gilligan, my boy, how does it feel to be in the oil business? GILLIGAN Well -- Gilligan falls off the chair onto the floor. Skipper grabs at him to steady him. SKIPPER How does it feel to be out of the oil business, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL I must say, the joke is on me. Missus Howell and I laughed all afternoon. Skipper laughs. SKIPPER I'll bet. MR HOWELL How much? SKIPPER Purely a figure of speech. MR HOWELL No. Surely you're a man of the world, Captain. You see nothing wrong with, shall we say, a game of chance? SKIPPER It all depends on what the game is. MR HOWELL What kind would you like? Cards? Mr. Howell spreads a deck of cards on the tablecloth. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Dice? Mr. Howell tosses a pair of dice onto the table. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Roulette? Mr. Howell reaches beneath the table and pulls out a bamboo roulette spinner. He gives the spinner a partial spin. SKIPPER Not interested, Mister Howell. There's only one game that I ever gamble on, and that's pool. MR HOWELL Pool? Mr. Howell walks to the end of the table. SKIPPER Now, were you to have a pool table, I might be interested in placing a bet with you. Mr. Howell pulls the tablecloth off the table to reveal a pool table, complete with rack, cues, and balls. Skipper and Gilligan jump to their feet, their mouths open in astonishment that Mr. Howell has a pool table. They glance at each other and close their mouths. Mr. Howell chalks his pool cue. MR HOWELL Shall we lag for break? FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT MR HOWELL Nine in that pocket, ten over here, and the eleven the hard way, in there. Let's see.

MR HOWELL Thirteen and ten in this pocket, the two in the side pocket, the nine and fourteen up here, respectively, the eight in that pocket, the eleven in there and the little four ball down here in a -- what I call a difficult, but delightful, shot. Mr. Howell shoots. SERIES OF SHOTS MANY BALLS GO IN THE POCKETS CLOSEUP - SKIPPER Skipper watches the balls fall in with miraculous ease. CLOSEUP - GILLIGAN Gilligan watches the balls fall in amazement. SERIES OF SHOTS EVEN MORE BALLS GO IN THE POCKETS MEDIUM - SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN MORE BALLS FALL IN THE POCKETS BACK TO SCENE ONE FINAL BALL FALLS IN A CORNER POCKET Mr. Howell smiles victoriously. Skipper and Gilligan show fatigue. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - MORNING Mr. Howell lines up his shot. Skipper wipes his brow and looks exhausted. Mrs. Howell stands at the door. MRS HOWELL Thurston, when are you men going to eat? SKIPPER Just one more game, Mrs. Howell? MRS HOWELL But your breakfast is getting stone cold. Mr. Howell shoots and the ball falls in a pocket. Skipper runs up to Mr. Howell. Mr. Howell victoriously places his cue on the table. SKIPPER Rack them up again, Howell. MR HOWELL Why don't we settle up before we start another game? SKIPPER Settle up? What for? MR HOWELL You owe me quite a lot. SKIPPER I beg your pardon. Do I look like the type of man who'd run out on a twelve million dollar bet? MR HOWELL As a matter of fact, you do. However, if Gilligan will just sign this -- uh, this note -- Mr. Howell removes a piece of paper from his coat pocket along with a pen. SKIPPER What kind of note? MR HOWELL Well, it's a -- it's a note. You just sign right there at the bottom, Gilligan, my boy. Gilligan reads the note aloud. GILLIGAN "I owe you twelve million dollars, payable on demand." MR HOWELL Just sign at the bottom. Skipper offers his back as a writing surface for Gilligan to sign the note. SKIPPER Don't worry, Gilligan. I'll win it back for you the first chance I get to shoot. GILLIGAN I know you will, Skipper. Gilligan signs the note and hands them to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL Keep the pen. SKIPPER Rack them up again, Howell. (sotto, to Gilligan) I think his luck is just about to change. MR HOWELL It already has. I want my twelve million now. SKIPPER Now? Well, he just signed a note for you. MR HOWELL The note says "payable on demand," and I demand payment. SKIPPER But I don't have that much money. MR HOWELL Well, certainly you have something worth twelve million dollars: watch, cufflinks -- (beat) -- oil company? GILLIGAN Oh yeah, I forgot. My oil company. Gilligan removes the deed to the oil company from his back pocket. Mr. Howell grabs the deed to the oil company right out from Gilligan's hands. MR HOWELL No, no, no. It's my oil company! Mr. Howell laughs. MR HOWELL (cont'd) The wizard of Wall Street strikes again. Mr. Howell exits as Gilligan and Skipper watch him leave. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT.

I hear you had dinner with the Howells last night. The Professor sits down on a stump and enjoys a beverage in a coconut cup. MR HOWELL Yes, a catered chuck-wagon affair: all you could eat for twelve million dollars. GILLIGAN All you could eat for twelve million dollars. That's a pretty funny one, isn't it, Skipper? Skipper laughs and forces Gilligan to sit down in his chair. SKIPPER Sit down, Gilligan. Professor gets up and walks to the table with lunch. Mr. Howell checks his watch. MR HOWELL Oh, goodness. It's time for the twelve o'clock stock market report. Mr. Howell, still looking at his watch, bumps into Professor on his way to the radio, causes the Professor to spill his drink.

GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT EXT. VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY GILLIGAN as he sits on a bicycle device that he slowly pedals. PULL BACK TO REVEAL a water wheel contraption that dumps water into a trough. PAN ALONG the length of the trough, which feeds water to a small garden that the Professor tends. PROFESSOR That's perfect, Gilligan. Water's flowing just right. GILLIGAN Thanks, Professor. Hi, Skipper. Skipper enters. He carries two potted, hanging plants on each end of a bamboo pole. SKIPPER Hi, Gilligan. Where do you want these plants, Professor? PROFESSOR Oh, here, Skipper, I'll take them. GILLIGAN You know, Skipper, this gets awful monotonous. SKIPPER Gilligan, why don't you make a game out of it? Pretend that you're taking a long bicycle ride from Cleveland, Ohio to Chicago, Illinois. GILLIGAN Hey, Skipper. SKIPPER What? GILLIGAN Which way do I turn, left or right at Cincinnati? SKIPPER Will you keep pedaling? Left! PROFESSOR You know, Skipper, these breadfruit plants are fantastic. They're so rich in food value, one could live indefinitely on them. GILLIGAN I'd rather live on smorgasbord. SKIPPER Smorgasbord? GILLIGAN Yeah, you know, smoked oysters, fried kippers, pickled herring, finnan haddie, salted peanuts. (dry mouth) Boy, am I thirsty. Gilligan stops pedaling. He dismounts the bicycle and walks to the water wheel and tries to get a drink of water. SKIPPER Gilligan. Skipper taps Gilligan on the shoulder. SKIPPER (cont'd) The water won't flow when you're not pedaling. Gilligan mounts the bicycle and pedals. PROFESSOR Pump, Gilligan, pump. GILLIGAN I am pumping. PROFESSOR Well, so you are. I don't understand it. The water's not coming through. GILLIGAN Maybe the spring dried up. PROFESSOR I think you're right, Gilligan. This spring is our only source of fresh water on the whole island. GILLIGAN What happened to it? PROFESSOR I don't know. If something has interfered with our water supply, this is just the beginning. First the plants will die, then the fruit trees will die, and then -- And then, this can be serious, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Serious? PROFESSOR Very serious. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. SHOWER - DAY Gilligan races through the jungle looking for Skipper. GILLIGAN Hey, Skipper, where are you? Hey, Skip-- He sees the shower being used, with a large container dumping water into the shower. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Don't use the water! I got some important news for -- Gilligan trips on a stone, falls, and slides in the mud under the curtain into the shower. He stops at a pair of bare feet. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Skipper? GINGER Really, Gilligan, do I look like the Skipper? Gilligan pulls himself out of the mud and stands up. GILLIGAN Well. I don't know. Bare feet are bare feet, but then -- Ginger pokes her head through the shower curtain. GINGER (sultry) Yes? GILLIGAN No, you sure don't look like the Skipper. GINGER Thanks. Hey, would you be a doll and get me that towel over there on the bush? Gilligan walks over to the bush where he sees a towel that is too tiny to wrap around Ginger. GILLIGAN You mean this little towel? GINGER Yeah. Come on, bring it over. I won't bite you. GILLIGAN You promise you won't bite me? GINGER I promise I won't bite you. Ginger withdraws and Gilligan reaches in and hands Ginger the towel. Ginger bites him. He withdraws his hand quickly. GILLIGAN Ow! You bit me! GINGER (sultry) Yeah. Aren't I a tease? Gilligan looks at his bitten finger. GINGER (O.S.) Hey, don't go away. I'll be right out. GILLIGAN You'll be right out? Gilligan mildly panics, for he is unprepared for Ginger to emerge with that tiny towel wrapped around her. GINGER (O.S.) Ready or not, here I come. Ginger emerges from the shower with the towel wrapped around her head. GILLIGAN I'm not ready. Ginger has another, much larger towel wrapped around her body. GINGER But I was just washing my hair, silly. You certainly are bashful. GILLIGAN Only with girls. Ginger draws a heart in the mud covering Gilligan's shirt. GINGER You shouldn't be so shy. (sultry) You know, I think under all that mud -- there's a charming, attractive -- man. Ginger exits. Gilligan looks down at the heart and wipes the mud all over his chest to obliterate Ginger's artwork. Gilligan steps into the shower. Skipper enters. SKIPPER Ginger's scarf. As lovely a girl as I've ever seen. Skipper picks a flower from a nearby plant. He sniffs the flower, knocks on the side of the shower, and then hands it over the top of the shower to its occupant. SKIPPER (cont'd) Here's for one of the loveliest persons on the island. Gilligan emerges from the shower. GILLIGAN Thanks, Skipper. My first corsage. Does that mean we're engaged? SKIPPER Gilligan, what are you doing in there -- with your clothes on? GILLIGAN I've been trying to find you, Skipper. I have some very important news. SKIPPER News? What news? GILLIGAN Oh, I don't know. With everything happening -- the mud, Ginger -- (smiles) -- my first corsage -- SKIPPER Here, Gilligan, this'll wake you up. Skipper pushes Gilligan back into the shower and tries to dump water on him by pulling on the cord, but there's no more water. SKIPPER (cont'd) Hey, there's no water. GILLIGAN Right. That's what the news is about. We're out of water. FLIP TO: EXT. WATER SUPPLY - DAY Mary Ann and Ginger pour gourds filled with water into a bag suspended from a bamboo tripod. Skipper and Professor discuss the castaways situation. PROFESSOR Skipper, until we locate a spring or dig a new well, I suggest we start a rationing system. SKIPPER A very good suggestion, Professor. SKIPPER (cont'd) Thank you, ladies, for your contribution to our water supply. Skipper exits. MARY ANN/GINGER You're welcome. Mary Ann taps the bottom of a gourd, emptying the last drops into the bag. MARY ANN Well, that's all the fresh water I have. GINGER Oh, my goodness. This isn't water. It's my perfume, "Mad Desire" mixed with "Flaming Passion." MARY ANN Great. I wonder what the men will do when they drink that. GINGER I don't know, but I'm dying to find out. Ginger turns and heads into the jungle. Mary Ann follows her. PROFESSOR No fish, girls. It'll make us thirsty. GINGER Okay. EXT. WATER SUPPLY - DAY Gilligan emerges from the jungle. GILLIGAN Water. Water. Water I gotta have water. I'll go mad. Water. Water. Water. Please, Skipper, water, water. SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan, cut that out! We haven't even started rationing yet. GILLIGAN I know, I was just practicing for later. SKIPPER Here. Start by emptying these containers into our water supply. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. Gilligan picks up a gourd and dumps it, but the water comes out of the wrong place and flows onto the ground instead of into the bag. EXT. WATER SUPPLY - DAY The Howells emerge from the jungle. Professor and Skipper tend to the water supply. MR HOWELL Professor, is it true that you're planning to ration water? SKIPPER That's right, Mister Howell, we only have enough left in our water supply for a few days. PROFESSOR Yes, we may tap a spring in a day or two. I saw some shale rock formations where we could dig a well, if we all pitch in and help. MR HOWELL Count me out. When I sink a well, I usually strike oil. MRS HOWELL Yes, some people have a green thumb. Thurston has an oily one. Gilligan empties a gourd into the bag. GILLIGAN Skipper, what happens if we get thirsty? I mean, right now, I'd like to have a nice tall, cool glass -- SKIPPER Gilligan, little buddy, please. Until we can find a new spring or locate another place to dig a well, let's not use the word "water." In other words, it only makes everybody more thirsty. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Skipper, but I won't mention the name of that wet liquid again. See? I didn't say "water." Skipper scowls at Gilligan. Gilligan looks guilty. PROFESSOR Right now, I suggest we start rationing the amount we drink. SKIPPER Exactly, Professor. Now, like I said, we only have a few days left in our "mm-mm" supply. GILLIGAN "Mm-mm" supply? Skipper shushes Gilligan. Gilligan mouths "Oh, water." SKIPPER So Mister Howell, I'm going to put you in charge of the rationing. MRS HOWELL As usual, Thurston, the drinks are on you. See you at the hut, dear. Mrs. Howell exits into the jungle. MR HOWELL Ta-ta, dear. SKIPPER Well, let's get started looking for our new spring. I have my trusty new divining rod here. And believe me, gentlemen, If there's anything to drink on the island, I'll find it. This rod will point out even a few drops. PROFESSOR A divining rod, Skipper? We can't afford to trust our lives to superstition. SKIPPER Oh, Professor, it's not superstition. Mister Howell, what do you think of my new divining rod? MR HOWELL I think it's divine. No, it's utter nonsense. Hogwash. I don't believe it. The divining rod has a mind of its own and points at Mr. Howell. SKIPPER Hey, look! GILLIGAN It's pointing toward Mister Howell's leg. Skipper kneels as the divining rod points to Mr. Howell's left calf. MR HOWELL I'd better go to the hut. Lovey's expecting me. Coming, dear. Be right there. The divining rod vibrates aggressively. SKIPPER Come on, Mister Howell, your pants leg. Mr. Howell raises his pant leg and reveals a flask strapped to his calf. Gilligan is surprised. Mr. Howell is irritated that his flask was discovered. He removes the flask and carries it to the tripod with the water supply bag. Gilligan folds his arms across his chest. Mr. Howell empties the contents of the flask into the bag. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Skipper and Gilligan walk through the jungle. Skipper holds the divining rod which points further up the path. GILLIGAN Skipper, I'm still thirsty, but I didn't say double-u-a-tee -- SKIPPER All right, little buddy, all right. Come here, Gilligan. I got an idea. Skipper picks up a few pebbles from the ground. SKIPPER (cont'd) This is a little trick of survival I learned from the natives in the Solomon's. Skipper hands pebbles to Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now put these pebbles in your mouth, Gilligan, and suck on them. It works. Honest, it does. Gilligan and Skipper put the pebbles in their mouths. Gilligan mumbles with the pebbles in his mouth. Skipper mumbles a reply. Gilligan mumbles back. Skipper spits out the pebbles into his hand. SKIPPER (cont'd) Oh, Gilligan, please don't talk to me when I got a mouthful of pebbles. Skipper puts the pebbles back in this mouth. Gilligan mumbles again. Skipper chokes on the pebbles. Gilligan pats his back. Skipper swallows the pebbles and gasps for breath. SKIPPER (cont'd) What was it that was so important that you had to say to me? Gilligan spits out the pebbles into his hand. GILLIGAN I was just going to tell you that I'd never talk when you have pebbles in your mouth because you might -- GILLIGAN/SKIPPER -- swallow them. SKIPPER Thanks a lot, Gilligan. The divining rod points to another water location. GILLIGAN Skipper, it's starting to point. SKIPPER Yeah, right over there. GILLIGAN No, Skipper, over here. Gilligan tugs on one branch of the divining rod. SKIPPER Over there! Skipper tugs in a different direction. GILLIGAN No, over here. SKIPPER Over there! GILLIGAN Here. SKIPPER There! They tear the diving rod apart. FLIP TO: EXT. WELL SITE - DAY Mr. Howell emerges from the jungle. He carries a large bucket. MR HOWELL Oh, Captain! Oh, Gilligan! Your water boy! Gilligan digs a hole with a bamboo shovel. He throws the dirt over his shoulder. The dirt lands on Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Good heavens! It's so dry, it's raining dirt. Water! Water! Captain! Skipper hammers a nail into a bamboo post. GILLIGAN Skipper! Skipper turns to look at Gilligan and hammers his thumb instead of the nail. Skipper yelps in pain. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Here. Let me do it. Gilligan takes the hammer from Skipper. MR HOWELL Oh, I see I'm just in time here. GILLIGAN Oh, Mister Howell, you're all covered with dirt. Let me brush you off. Here. Gilligan uses his hands to brush off the dirt from Mr. Howell's shirt. The dirt on Gilligan's hands contribute to the dirt on Mr. Howell's shirt. MR HOWELL Don't do that, Gilligan! Your hands are dirty! Look. GILLIGAN Not now, Mister Howell. Gilligan shows that his hands are clean since he rubbed the dirt onto Mr. Howell's shirt. SKIPPER Time for our afternoon rations already? MR HOWELL That's exactly why I'm here. I'm your friendly water boy. All right, Gilligan, go ahead. Now, that's a good boy. Close your eyes, open your mouth. GILLIGAN Okay, Mister Howell. Fill her up. MR HOWELL Here we are. Eyes closed, mouth open. Here we go. Mr. Howell uses an eyedropper to put water in Gilligan's mouth. GILLIGAN Is that all I get for my afternoon ration, eight drops? MR HOWELL Eight drops? Good heavens, you got your evening rations, too. Here's one for the road. Mr. Howell dispenses a few more drops of water into Gilligan's mouth. FLIP TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT EXT. WATER SUPPLY - NIGHT Skipper measures the water in the bag with a stick. SKIPPER Gilligan, I want you to guard this water with your life. GILLIGAN You can count on me, Skipper. SKIPPER I hope so -- 'cause if you don't guard this water with your life, your life might not be worth guarding. SKIPPER (cont'd) Got a knife? GILLIGAN A knife? Those people out there are my friends. SKIPPER I just want to mark the water level on this stick. Gilligan hands the knife to Skipper. Skipper marks the water level with the knife. SKIPPER (cont'd) All right, now. That's how much water we have now. We'd better have as much when I get back. Those folks might start getting desperate. GILLIGAN Desperate? SKIPPER Very desperate. Skipper walks away. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, keep a stiff upper lip. Gilligan smiles uncomfortably as a bird CALLS out. FLIP TO: EXT. WATER SUPPLY - NIGHT Gilligan paces on guard duty over the water bag. He has a knife tucked into his belt. GILLIGAN I'm not afraid. I'm not a bit afraid. I'm not afraid. As Gilligan's back is turned, Mr. Howell enters from the jungle. Gilligan continues pacing. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I'm not scared, I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. I think I did it. I'm not one bit afraid! Mr. Howell taps Gilligan on the shoulder with his walking stick. Gilligan exclaims in surprise. MR HOWELL I'm sorry, my boy, I didn't mean to alarm you. GILLIGAN You didn't alarm me. You just scared me. MR HOWELL There's something I have to tell you. GILLIGAN If it's about the water, Mister Howell, the answer's "no." MR HOWELL No, no, it's something I must tell you in deepest confidence. Mr. Howell walks to the edge of the water supply clearing. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Come over here. Come here, Gilligan. Gilligan, come here. Gilligan walks over to Mr. Howell. GILLIGAN Okay, Mister Howell, but when I come over here, it's the same as the answer over there. No. MR HOWELL Gilligan, my boy, I must tell you that you are in very serious trouble. GILLIGAN Huh? MR HOWELL Well, I happen to know that someone is planning to steal the water supply. Mr. Howell whistles the Howell Family whistle. GILLIGAN Who? MR HOWELL Who? It's someone that you know very very well. Mr. Howell whistles the Howell Family whistle. GILLIGAN Why are you whistling, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL A little bird call. Gilligan whistles the Howell Family whistle. Mrs. Howell enters and approaches the water bag and dips two tall leather boots in to remove water from the bag. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Now, the master plan, you see, is these two people plan to distract you -- and while your back is turned -- GILLIGAN Huh? Gilligan turns toward the water supply, but Mr. Howell focuses his attention on him. MR HOWELL -- one of them is going to steal the water. GILLIGAN Who'd do a thing like that? MR HOWELL Please! No names. Mrs. Howell removes the boots from the water bag and returns to the jungle. GILLIGAN How many are there? MR HOWELL No, there's two. Hard to tell, you see, in a crowd, but Missus Howell and I both think if this should happen that your name would be mud. GILLIGAN Changing my name wouldn't do any good. The Skipper could still find me. He knows what I look like. MR HOWELL Good luck, my boy. GILLIGAN Good night, and thanks for the warning. You sure you can't tell me their names? MR HOWELL I would never forgive myself. Time to turn in. Good night. Mr. Howell exits into the jungle. Gilligan whistles the Howell Family whistle. FLIP TO: EXT. WATER SUPPLY - NIGHT Ginger enters and pretends that Gilligan has abandoned his guard duty post. Gilligan hides behind a small bush. Ginger pretends that she has no idea where Gilligan is. GINGER Ooh. My goodness me. Why has Gilligan left the water bag unguarded? Anybody who wanted to steal it could have stolen it by now. Gilligan crouches on one side of the bush while Ginger stands on the other side of the bush. GINGER (cont'd) Now, where in the world could Gilligan be? Gilligan pops up from behind a small bush. GILLIGAN Here I am. GINGER Oh! My goodness! Gilligan, where were you? GILLIGAN I was hiding behind the bush. Lucky thing for you you didn't try to steal any water. While Ginger talks with Gilligan, she turns him so his back is to the water bag. GINGER Oh, Gilligan, you silly, suspicious boy. Ginger walks backward, away from the water bag. He gentle pulls Gilligan with her. GINGER (cont'd) (sultry) Now, why in the world would I do a thing like that? I saw the Skipper, and he told me that you were on guard duty. So I came over to keep you company. GILLIGAN Gee, thanks. GINGER Gee, Gilligan, I don't know how you do it. I mean, hour after hour after hour. Don't you ever get sleepy? Gilligan shakes his head. GINGER (cont'd) I mean, don't you ever find that your eyes are getting heavier, heavier -- wanting to close? Gilligan's eyelids droop. Mary Ann enters from the jungle carrying a full-length glove. GINGER (cont'd) Arms are so heavy, heavy that you can't keep them up. Gilligan's eyes close. GINGER (cont'd) Don't you ever feel that you're going into a deep, deep, deep sleep? Gilligan's eyes pop open. GILLIGAN Nope. GINGER Of course not. A big, strong man like you would never fall asleep. Gilligan's eyelids droop again. GINGER (cont'd) I mean, a big, strong man like you, your right eye could never get so heavy. Mary Ann approaches the water bag. Gilligan's closes his eyes. GINGER (cont'd) There. A big, strong man like you could never, never, never fall asleep. Gilligan drowsily shakes his head. GILLIGAN No, I could never fall -- Gilligan snores. GINGER Asleep, asleep. Mary Ann removes the glove filled with water from the water bag and exits into the jungle. Ginger sees Mary Ann escape with the glove. GINGER (cont'd) Goodbye, Gilligan. Ginger kisses her finger and moves to press it to Gilligan's lips. Gilligan's head drops and Ginger's finger presses into Gilligan's hat. Ginger shrugs and turns to exit. FLIP TO: EXT. WATER SUPPLY - NIGHT Skipper marches through the jungle to the water bag. Behind him are Mary Ann with her water-filled glove, Mrs. Howell with her water-filled boots. Ginger trails. SKIPPER Gilligan. GILLIGAN Advance and be recognized, Skipper. SKIPPER Right this way. GILLIGAN What's all the big fuss about? SKIPPER I'll show you. Ladies. Mary Ann dumps the water from the glove into the water bag. SKIPPER (cont'd) Missues Howell? Mrs. Howell dumps the water from the boots into the water bag. Skipper uses the stick to measure the depth of the water. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, you're lucky. It's all there. Now, aren't you all ashamed of yourselves? Mr. Howell, Mrs. Howell, Ginger, and Mary Ann lower their heads in shame. MR HOWELL I'm ashamed we got caught. SKIPPER And you, Gilligan -- GILLIGAN Skipper, I don't know -- SKIPPER Gilligan, what have you been doing here all this time? GILLIGAN I made a new divining rod. Look. Gilligan holds up his divining rod. SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan. It takes a very special technique to make a divining rod. GILLIGAN Skipper, will you stop being sore at me if it hits water? SKIPPER I promise I will never ever get sore at you again if that divining rod hits water. Well, let me see it. GILLIGAN No. Gilligan tries to hide the divining rod behind himself, and pokes a hole in the water bag. The water dumps out onto the ground through the hole. Gilligan is embarrassed. MR HOWELL That boy needs therapy. Gilligan stares at the last water as it drips out of the water bag. He is ashamed as he turns to the other castaways. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. WELL SITE - DAY Skipper pedals the auger rig drilling a hole for a well. SKIPPER Darn clever, Professor. Sure beats digging by hand. PROFESSOR We've got to keep our fingers crossed. Gilligan spilled every drop of water we had left. Gilligan enters. Professor folds his arms across his chest and turns away from Gilligan. Skipper pedals the auger rig and turns away. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. Hi, Professor. I don't blame you for not talking to me, but I want to help. If you want me to go away, just nod. Professor and Skipper exchange glances and then simultaneously nod. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I'll give you one more chance. If you want me to go -- They nod again. GILLIGAN (cont'd) -- away. Gilligan leaves them. FLIP TO: INT. JUNGLE - DAY Mary Ann and Ginger sit on chairs and sew a sheet to catch the morning dew. GINGER I'm thirsty. MARY ANN Oh, I told you: concentrate on your sewing. That'll take your mind off of it. GINGER That's what I did. Sewing reminded me of dresses, and dresses reminded me of wool. Wool reminded me of sheep, sheep reminded me of the mountains. The mountains reminded me of the desert, and the desert made me thirsty again. Gilligan enters. GILLIGAN Hi, girls. I came by to cheer you up. MARY ANN Hi, Gilligan. I doubt you can cheer us up. We're trying to make a sheet to catch the morning dew. GINGER If we're lucky, we'll get a thimbleful of water. GILLIGAN Well, look on the bright side girls. We might find a new spring any minute. And if we don't, it might rain. If it doesn't rain, people sometimes last four, five days -- GINGER Gee, Gilligan, do you really want to cheer us up? GILLIGAN Yeah. What can I do? GINGER Go cheer up the Howells. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Mrs. Howell wears a headband with a feather in it. Her dress looks vaguely native American, but she has accessorized it with a broach and pearls. MRS HOWELL I can't understand it, Thurston. All that nonsense about a divining rod to bring water. MR HOWELL (O.S.) Yes, I know. Totally unscientific. MRS HOWELL Are you ready? Mr. Howell enters dressed in a Cherokee ceremonial headdress. MR HOWELL Yes, any time you are, my dear. One, two, three. The Howells perform a "rain dance." HOWELLS Ha! Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell look to the sky. MR HOWELL Rain! Mr. Howell looks at his dry palm and then back up at the sky. MR HOWELL (cont'd) You're not listening. MRS HOWELL I don't understand it. It worked last year in Yellowstone Park for the Cherokees. MR HOWELL What's wrong, anyway? Gilligan enters. GILLIGAN Hi, Mister and Missus Howell. Mr. Howell glances at Gilligan and back up at the sky. MR HOWELL Now I know what's wrong. FLIP TO: EXT. HUT CLEARING - DAY Gilligan writes a note to the other Castaways with a pencil and paper on a makeshift writing table made from a tree stump. He reads back what he wrote. GILLIGAN "Dear folks, every time I try to do something right, everything goes wrong. Maybe everybody would be better off without me." Gilligan finishes off the note and narrates while he writes. GILLIGAN (cont'd) "I make nothing but mistakes." Gilligan breaks the pencil lead. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I even make a mistake writing "mistakes." A frog jumps onto Gilligan's writing table. It CROAKS. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hey! Hi, frog. Would you mind getting your wet feet off my desk here? Come on, let's go. The frog CROAKS thrice. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Wet feet? Frog? Put them all together, they spell water. Okay, come on frog, now. Take me to your water. Come on, let's go. The frog CROAKS and leaps off Gilligan's writing table. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Wahoo! Gilligan gets up and exits. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I'll follow you. Yeah! FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan crawls along behind the frog. He nudges the frog to urge the frog to continue on toward the water. GILLIGAN Go, come on. Let's go now, come on. Froggy, where are you? Listen, I don't want to squish -- GILLIGAN'S HAND as he squishes a banana. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN (cont'd) -- you. Gilligan looks at the squished banana. FROG as it CROAKS. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan sees it. GILLIGAN (cont'd) There you are. INSERT - SQUISHED BANANA Gilligan wipes the squished banana on his hand onto his sleeve. He crawls after the frog. EXT. WELL SITE - DAY Mary Ann enters from the jungle. Skipper pedals the well-digging auger contraption. MARY ANN Skipper, oh, Skipper, have you seen Gilligan? SKIPPER Oh, Mary Ann, if I'd seen Gilligan, would I be riding this contraption? MARY ANN I think he may have done something desperate. Look at the note I found. Mary Ann hands the note to the Skipper. Skipper reads it aloud. SKIPPER "And maybe everyone would be better off without --" (pause) Oh, this is all my fault. My poor little buddy. MARY ANN Skipper, you don't think -- SKIPPER I don't know, but we better find out right away. Skipper dismounts the well-drilling auger contraption. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan chases the frog. GILLIGAN Froggy? Gilligan stands up to search for the frog. Gilligan trips, which sends his hat flying. His hat lands on the frog. Gilligan tries to retrieve his hat, but it jumps as he tries to grab it. As the frog jumps, the hat jumps too. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Now, you -- Gilligan lunges at the hat, but the frog jumps so Gilligan misses the hat. GILLIGAN (cont'd) All right, frog, I give up. The hat flies through the air and lands on Gilligan's head. Gilligan removes his hat and takes from frog out from inside the hat. GILLIGAN (cont'd) There you are. Come here. You all right? The frog CROAKS "all right." GILLIGAN (cont'd) Okay? The frog CROAKS "all right." GILLIGAN (cont'd) All right? The frog CROAKS "all right." GILLIGAN (cont'd) Take me to the water now. For you, it's easy. Come on. Gilligan picks up his hat, but does not put it on. FLIP TO: EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY Gilligan chases after the frog. He carries his hat in his hand. GILLIGAN Froggy! Frog? Where'd he go? Hey, frog? Gilligan partially falls into a hole and drops his HAT. His head, arms, and shoulders remain above ground. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Ooh. What a big hole. Gilligan slips and tries to hold on to the loose dirt. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I think I found out where he went. Gilligan falls further into the hole. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Just have to hang on and wait for -- Gilligan falls through the hole. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Help! INT. CAVE - DAY Gilligan falls into the cave. It has enough water that Gilligan sits chest-deep in water. GILLIGAN It's an underground cave, and there's lots of water. The frog CROAKS. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hi, thanks for helping me. I knew you would. Look, there's fresh water all over. Wait till I tell the others. Boy, will they be excited, huh? But how? Gilligan looks around the cave for a way back to the top. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I can't reach the top, and the sides are all smooth. (to frog) What am I gonna do? The frog CROAKS many times, as if speaking whole sentences. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Thanks for your advice, but it's too bad I don't speak frog. EXT. CLEARING - DAY Mr. Howell, Mrs. Howell, Professor, Mary Ann, and Ginger listen to the Skipper as he discusses search strategy. SKIPPER Folks, we've got to search every square foot of this island. MRS HOWELL We'll never forgive ourselves if we don't find that boy. MARY ANN If we ever do find him, we'll hug him, and squeeze him, and kiss him and -- GINGER Hey, what are we waiting for? Let's go. Ginger and Mary Ann exit. INT. CAVE - DAY Gilligan sits chest deep in water. He holds the frog. GILLIGAN Maybe if I yell, somebody will hear me. Hello! Gilligan's should of "Hello!" is echoed back. The frog CROAKS. GILLIGAN (cont'd) (to frog) I wasn't talking to you. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Mr. and Mrs. Howell walk through the jungle in search of Gilligan. MRS HOWELL Gilligan!

GINGER/MARY ANN Gilligan! EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY Skipper searches for Gilligan. SKIPPER Gilligan, little buddy. Gilligan! Skipper spies the hat Gilligan dropped. SKIPPER (cont'd) My little buddy's hat. Gilligan. Skipper notices the hole in the ground. SKIPPER (cont'd) Could he be in the hole? No, he wouldn't. Skipper leans over the hole and calls to Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan? Gilligan, are you down there? GILLIGAN (O.S.) Hey, Skipper! SKIPPER Gilligan! Skipper falls into the hole. INT. CAVE - DAY Skipper lands next to Gilligan. Skipper pulls himself out of the water. GILLIGAN Skipper! SKIPPER Gilligan, little buddy, is that you? GILLIGAN Yeah, Skipper. What are you doing down here? SKIPPER I brought you your hat. Skipper hands the hat to Gilligan. GILLIGAN Oh, thanks, Skipper. Boy, am I glad to see you, even if I can't. SKIPPER Well, think how happy I am! GILLIGAN Yeah, look. Fresh water! Fresh water! SKIPPER I don't mean about the water, little buddy. I mean about you. I don't mind telling you, I've got a lump in my throat. GILLIGAN Well, be careful. Don't swallow it. It might be my frog. Gilligan splashes around in the water looking for the frog. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell search in the jungle for Gilligan. MRS HOWELL Gilligan! MR HOWELL Gilligan! MRS HOWELL Oh, Thurston, we simply have got to find that boy. MR HOWELL I know what I'll do. I'll offer a reward. Five thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars! MRS HOWELL Thurston, there are times when money is absolutely useless. MR HOWELL Ooh, what you said, Lovey. INT. CAVE - DAY Gilligan sits chest-deep in water. Skipper knees in the water. GILLIGAN There's a tunnel over there. Maybe we can get out. SKIPPER We can't see where we're going. We need a light. GILLIGAN I got some matches, Skipper. SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan, so have I, but when we fell down in here, we fell in the water. The matches are wet. GILLIGAN Why don't we build a fire to dry them out? SKIPPER Gilligan, you can't light a fire to dry the matches when you've got to have dry matches to light a fire. GILLIGAN Oh, no wonder you're the skipper and I'm only the crew. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Professor, Mary Ann, and Ginger search the jungle for Gilligan. GINGER Gilligan! MARY ANN Gilligan! PROFESSOR Let's search that area over there. GINGER You know, I once had a part in a jungle movie where everybody got lost. MARY ANN Everybody? GINGER Yes, and nobody ever found them. The hero died. The heroine died. They all died. But that picture had a happy ending. PROFESSOR How could it have a happy ending? GINGER It made three million dollars. PROFESSOR Let's go. MARY ANN Gilligan! EXT.

PROFESSOR Just a little more Gilligan.  Gilligan is really huffing and puffing and is getting tired.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Good, good that's fine.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  PROFESSOR There, that ought to do it.  The professor takes the tongs out of the fire. Gilligan is panting heavily after blowing on the fire.  PAN LEFT WITH PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN TO LOW ROCK  We see the skipper, Ginger and Mary Ann approach them from behind.  SKIPPER How you doing with the nails professor!?  PROFESSOR We'll know in a few minutes professor skipper.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR You know I made this from that outcropping of ferrous oxide I found.  The professor is holding up the clamshell tongs with the nail he made.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  GILLIGAN It looks good enough to get rusty.  CUT TO: EXTREME CLOSE UP OF ROCK  The professor drops the hot nail on to the rock to cool.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  The professor walks off as Gilligan walks on camera.  GILLIGAN How 'bout that.  Gillian reaches down to pick up the nail off the rock.  GILLIGAN It's nothing but the rock and the fire. And the professor makes an a….Oooooo, Ooooooo!  Gilligan has taken the nail that is still hot and burns his fingers. He immediately drops it back down in a bucket of water and sticks his fingers in the water to cool them off.  GINGER (O.S.) Gilligan!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Let me see that!  Gilligan pulls his hand from the water and shows the skipper his hurt finger.  SKIPPER Oh not your finger, the nail!

We watch as the professor, Gilligan, Mary Ann, Ginger and the skipper make their way over to the damaged Minnow.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN AND GINGER NEXT TO THE MINNOW'S DAMAGED PORT SIDE  We see the large jagged hole in the Minnow's side. Gilligan is standing by ready to help the professor. Ginger is standing next to Gilligan watching. Gilligan hands the professor the items he calls out for.  PROFESSOR Ready Gilligan?  GILLIGAN Ready!  PROFESSOR Hammer!  Gilligan hands him a hammer.  GILLIGAN Hammer.  PROFESSOR Nail!  Ginger passes the nail to Gilligan who then passes it to the professor.  GILLIGAN Nail.  PROFESSOR Plank!  Gilligan hands him the plank.  GILLIGAN Plank.  GILLLIGAN Splinters! Ooo Ooo!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  GINGER Oh I'll take it out for you Gilligan.  GILLIGAN No it's all right Ginger.  GINGER No, I'm pretty good at first aid. I use to go with a doctor.  GILLIGAN No kidding!?  Ginger inspects Gilligan's finger, trying to remove the splinter.  GINGER Well actually he was kind of a part time doctor. He practiced medicine at night so he could pay his way through medical school.  She succeeds in removing the splinter.  GINGER Ooo I got it!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF MINNOW AND GROUP  We see the professor standing with the plank against the Minnow, hammer and nail in hand.  SKIPPER Ok folks this is the big moment. Keep you fingers crossed. This nail works, we can leave the island.  The professor places the nail on the board.  CUT TO: EXTREME CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR HAND AND THE MINNOW'S PORT SIDE WITH PLANK  The tension mounts, as the professor is about to nail in his homemade nail.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND MARY ANN  They have their fingers crossed for luck.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  They too have their fingers crossed.  CUT TO: EXTREME CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR HAND AND THE MINNOW'S PORT SIDE WITH PLANK  The professor lines up the hammer with the nail and swings. The nail completely disintegrates.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND MARY ANN  They both look let down.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND THE MINNOW'S PORT SIDE  The professor has the look of astonishment and surprise as he lets go of the plank, which immediately falls to the ground.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  GILLIGAN Maybe we need a softer hammer!  Gilligan has a silly look on his face.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND MARY ANN  The skipper is not happy with Gilligan's comment and restrains himself from hitting Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  Gilligan instinctively flinches at the skipper's reaction as we…      FADE OUT         ACT I  FADE IN  STOCK SHOT OF OCEAN SURF AND BEACH WITH PALM TREE IN BG  CUT TO: EXT - BEACH - DAY  WIDE SHOT OF UPPER BEACH AREA  We see Mr. and Mrs. Howell walking briskly on the beach towards the Minnow.  PAN RIGHT WITH THE HOWELLS TO SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  The skipper is working near the Minnow's bow, while Gilligan is placing a long bamboo pole on the Minnow's forward deck.  MR HOWELL Oh skipper. You still expect to get the Queen Mary ready to sail in six days?  SKIPPER We have to Mr. Howell. The high tide may be our last chance to get off the island.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I know we'll do it! The professors working on a new formula for making nails. I told him what was wrong with the last one.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL YOU told him!?  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Yeah…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPE AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN …it broke when he hammered it.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL Oh.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Now folks, while the professor's working on the nails, I thought we'd get the boat ready for launching. Maybe you two could make some rope.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL Thurston that sounds like fun. We'll make ropes out of vines!  MR HOWELL Oh good! That little ole vine maker me!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  The skipper laughs as Gilligan just stares not getting the joke.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  MR HOWELL I do marvelous imitations!  Mr. and Mrs. Howell walk off camera.  SKIPPER Gilligan, get another pole. We can prop up this keel.  He starts to walk next to the Minnow when he hits the pole on the deck with his head.  SKIPPER Doh!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Watch your head skipper!  SKIPPER (SARCASTACALLY) Thanks Gilligan! Will you get that pole!  GILLIGAN Aye, aye sir.

CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND MINNOW  Gilligan stumbles on camera with the pole and ends up punching a hole in the Minnow's side, adding yet another hole to be fixed.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper is looking upset at Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is sitting on the ground rubbing his head looking a little dazed.  SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER Will you go help someone else!?  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan runs off camera.  SKIPPER Move!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT OF PROFESSOR ON BEACH  The professor is just finishing another nail by the fire. Gilligan walks on camera.  GILLIGAN Hi! Another nail?  PROFESSOR Yes. New formula. Less brittle. Hope this one works.  The professor drops the nail in a bucket of water. Gilligan immediately reaches in and picks it out.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is holding the nail straight up from its point and examines it. The nail starts to bend over as if was made of limp rubber.  GILLIGAN A lot less brittle all right.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND PROFESSOR  The professor comes over to see what's going on.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan then holds the nail by it's head so the nail hangs down straight.  GILLIGAN Works fine if you hold it this way!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND PROFESSOR  He then hold the nail again by it's point with the nail sticking up. It once again bends over.  GILLIGAN Don't feel bad. Maybe you invented noodles!  The professor gives Gilligan a dirty look.  GILLIGAN I know, why don't I go and help somebody else.  Gilligan walks off camera. The professor reaches in the bucket and picks up the nail.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR  He holds the nail like Gilligan did and it just falls over again.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  MEDIUM SHOT  Gilligan is walking through the jungle.  PAN RIGHT WITH GILLIGAN TO MARY ANN AND GINGER  Mary Ann and Ginger are sitting on the ground making something for lunch.  GILLIGAN Hi girls!  GINGER Hi.  MARY ANN Hi! How'd the professor's new nail work out?  GILLIGAN Well, you can't use it to nail anything together, but it ought to make a great Christmas ribbon.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN Oh we'll never get off this island.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER Don't talk like that Mary Ann. Remember, in our darkest hour when all seems lost, somewhere in the fearsome black of night, let us search for that shinning star, which will guide us out of our desolation.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Gee that was a beautiful speech Ginger.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER It was from a movie I was in.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Oh, what was the title?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER That WAS the title.

Gilligan would you get me some more breadfruit…   CUT TO: WIDE SHOT OF GILLIGAN, MARY ANN AND GINGER  (CONTINUED) …for this batter?  GINGER Oh I'll get it. Gilligan can help you with the pancakes.  GILLIGAN Pancakes!?  MARY ANN Sure!  GINGER Sure!  Ginger gets up and walks off camera.  SLOW ZOOM IN FOR CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN  MARY ANN Sure! I mashed up some breadfruit, put in coconut milk and, wild duck eggs. How's it taste?  Gilligan sticks his finger in the bowl to take a taste.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Like breadfruit, coconut milk and wild duck eggs.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  As Mary Ann continues to stir her concoction.  MARY ANN If we only had some Maple syrup.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Well there's lots of tree on the island. Maybe one is full of syrup.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN  Gilligan fishes in his pocket for his knife.  MARY ANN Good! Let's go look!  GILLIGAN Yeah.  She gets up with Gilligan and walk off camera.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE IN JUNGLE  We see several trees in the jungle as Gilligan and Mary Ann walk on camera. They start to inspect the trees to see which one might give syrup.  GILLIGAN Lets try this one here. Huh?  MARY ANN All right!  Gilligan takes his knife and makes a small hole in the tree. He starts to suck on the tree to get something out of it. He has a sour look on his face.  MARY ANN No good?  Gilligan shakes his head no.  GILLIGAN Hm…emm.  MARY ANN (DISAPPOINTEDLY) Oh.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE IN JUNGLE  The Howell's are strolling through the jungle and towards the camera.  MRS HOWELL It was so WISE of you Thurston to insist that the boat be repaired. It won't be long now before we're home.  They stop for a close up.  MR HOWELL And not a moment too soon! Already missed twelve board meetings of six of my corporations! Or is it six board meetings of twelve of my corporations?  MRS HOWELL Awe poor Thurston, you do have problems.  MR HOWELL It is rather difficult being rich. If it weren't for the money, I'd rather be poor! I must remember to write that down!  Mrs. Howell looks off camera and sees Gilligan and Mary Ann.  MRS HOWELL Thurston, what do you suppose those young people are doing?  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN  We see them both standing by a tree with the lips pressed to the bark.  MARY ANN Mmmmmm…Sour!  GILLIGAN Yeah?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL Well it's perfectly obvious Lovey. They're kissing trees.  MRS HOWELL Must be a new fad. Oh, the younger generation!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN  Mary Ann looks like she's kissing the tree.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL They DO seem to be enjoying themselves. Think I'll have a go at it myself.  MRS HOWELL Oh darling you're so modest.  PAN LEFT AND PULL BACK WITH MR HOWELL  Mr. Howell gets close to a tree and gives it a kiss. His reaction is not unexpected.  MRS HOWELL Well?  MR HOWELL There's a lot to be said for the old fashioned way.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN NEAR TREE  Mary Ann is seen getting the sap from a tree when she seems to have a favorable reaction.  MARY ANN mMMmmm! It's sweet!  GILLIGAN Yeah!  MARY ANN Just like you Gilligan.  Gilligan gets embarrassed but proceeds to hole the tree with his knife.  GILLIGAN (SHYLY) Oh yeah.  Gilligan has holed the tree and is waiting for the sap to gush forth.  GILLIGAN Yeah, he…here comes the sap.  MARY ANN Oh here, here.  Mary Ann hands Gilligan a coconut cup to catch the sap in.  CUT TO EXTREME CLOSE UP OF TREE AND COCONUT CUP  The sap pours out of the tree and into the cup.  FADE TO: EXT - BEACH - DAY  WIDE SHOT  The skipper and Gilligan working on the boat in the background. The professor is working on another new nail formula by the fire, as Ginger walks up behind him.  GINGER How's it going professor?  The professor, unaccustomed to being around beautiful women, becomes fluster and starts to shake.  SLOW ZOOM IN WITH PROFESSOR FOR CLOSE UP SHOT  PROFESSOR Oh! Oh well…well I'll have to a…I'll have to wait till it, cools before I, try it.  He walks over to the rock and sets the hot nail down.  GINGER Gee I think it's amazing how you do all those experiments with such shaky hands!  PROFESSOR Well they weren't shaky until a second ago.  GINGER Oh, maybe it's the heat or something.  The professor looks at Ginger with that, you don't have a clue look.  PROFESSOR Yeah.  The professor has finished another nail.  PROFESSOR Skipper! Skipper this nails ready!  SKIPPER Good! Bring it over, we'll try it out!  The professor and Ginger run over to the boat.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is on the bow of the boat and hands down a hammer.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  The professor takes the hammer from Gilligan. While the skipper is holding a plank in place against the boats hull.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND GINGER  The professor looks at Ginger and smiles with anticipation.  QUICK CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  He too is waiting with anticipation.  QUICK CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is watching everything from the boats bow.  CUT TO: EXTREME CLOSE UP OF PLANK  The professor once again lines up the hammer with the nail. He gives the nail a quick hit and it explodes in a million pieces with a loud bang.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND GINGER  He gets startled and backs up and looking rather surprised.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  He's looking a bit surprised too.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Well, at least we have a nail for the fourth of July.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper once again gives Gilligan the evil eye.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR Two days left to float her and I STILL haven't got the right formula!  SKIPPER Professor, I guess we're licked. We'll need a miracle now to get off this island.  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - EVENING  WIDE SHOT OF GROUP  The castaways are all seated around the communal table getting ready to have something to eat. They're chatting amongst themselves in an ad-lib fashion. Mary Ann and Ginger walk on camera from carrying a platter full of pancakes.  GINGER Hope you're all hungry.  MARY ANN Lunch time!  MRS HOWELL Oh look.  SKIPPER Well look at this! Pancakes!  PROFESSOR Isn't that wonderful!?  Mary Ann sets the platter down on the table as the castaways start ad-libbing and talking over each other.  SKIPPER Wonderful ladies!  MARY ANN And Gilligan made the syrup too.  MRS HOWELL Gilligan made it?  MR HOWELL I didn't…I didn't know that you were a…a ah…  PROFESSOR From what? Where did you get it?  GILLIGAN From a tree.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper is putting syrup on his pancakes.  MARY ANN (O.S.) Does it look good!?  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Very good!  The skipper has finished pouring syrup over his pancakes and is about to eat them.  SKIPPER Well ladies, here's to a new task treat.  He uses his fork to lift up a piece of pancake, and it immediately snaps back down on the plate.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  She laughs.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  Mary Ann thinks the skipper is fooling around too and finds it funny.  MARY ANN Oh, skipper!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper finds this amusing and tries again with the same results. He's trying to be gracious about Mary Ann's cooking and doesn't want to offend her.  SKIPPER That's something I like! Syrup with a lot a body to it ha…ha…ha…ha!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  The Howell's just stare at the skipper's antics.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND PROFESSOR  They watch with some amusement.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  He tries again and again it snaps back down on the plate. The skipper is visibly upset about the situation.  SKIPPER What are these, pancakes or Yo-Yo's!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  The Howell's are fighting with their pancakes as well.  MRS HOWELL I can't cut this!  MR HOWELL Yes they seem to be sticking a bit.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND PROFESSOR  He's trying to lift up a piece of pancake too, but it also keeps being pulled back down.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan repeatedly lifts a piece of pancake up, only to have it be pulled down like it was attached with rubber bands.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  PROFESSOR Gilligan. Where did you get this…this substance?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN From a tree.  Gilligan lifts the pieces of pancake again, but this time it hesitates before being pulled back to the plate.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  Mary Ann is fighting with her pancake.  MARY ANN Well its something like maple syrup.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  Ginger is pulling up and down on hers, almost playing with it.  GINGER Gee, I've seen brand new girdles that weren't as snappy as this.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER It's getting to be like glue! Even worse!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR  The professor is examining the plate with the glued down pancake and fork.  PROFESSOR Yes, it certainly is. It's setting like cement.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND PROFESSOR  GILLIGAN Sure is! Look!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  We see the elevated fork and piece of pancake on Gilligan's plate. Gilligan gives the fork a slight pull and lets go. It vibrates back and forth like a spring.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR  The professor looks intently at the plate and gets an idea.  PROFESSOR I wonder. I just wonder. Come on!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT OF GROUP AT TABLE  PROFESSOR Follow me!  The professor gets up and runs quickly off camera. The others just stare, not knowing if he's flipped out or not. The skipper, Gilligan and Mary Ann get up form the table and follow the professor off camera.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL Really Thurston such manners! Eat and run!  MR HOWELL Positively vulgar!  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY  WIDE SHOT  We see the professor squatting down near the lagoon. He's splashing the plate around in the water and looking at it. He seems extremely excited.

They grab him by the arms as we…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER, PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Calm down now!  PROFESSOR Every thing's perfectly all right! Gilligan, Gilligan, is there any more of this material around!?  GILLIGAN Oh yeah trunks full, I mean tree trunks full.  PROFESSOR You found the miracle we've been looking for Gilligan!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN You mean syrup!?  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  PROFESSOR Exactly! Must be a combination of rubber, chickle and resin that bonded together when you heated it! It's a perfect cement for repairing the boat!  GILLIGAN It is!?  SKIPPER Well then we can patch up the Minnow and be in time to catch that high tide after all!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN Thanks to Gilligan glue!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  PROFESSOR Right! It's permanent! It's waterproof! And it's powerful!  GILLIGAN And it tastes good on pancakes too!  FADE TO: EXT - BEACH - DAY  MEDIUM SHOT  The skipper and the professor are hard at work on the boat as Gilligan, Ginger and Mary Ann walk on camera.  GILLIGAN Hey how's it coming? Think it'll be ready?  SKIPPER Just a moment Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Do you think it'll work!?  SKIPPER It'll be ready. Will you stand back!? Thank you.  Gilligan gets out of the skippers way.  Skipper Well, hear it goes!  The skipper and professor apply a plank to the side of the Minnow's hull and pounds it into place.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR, GINGER AND MARY ANN  PROFESSOR Now we better let it set for a few minutes skipper.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I sure am glad I did something right for a change.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN Gilligan you deserve a reward for this.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan looks a little shy.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Here,…  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP  The professor tosses Gilligan the plate with the glued on pancake.  PROFESSOR …better keep this, Smithsonian Institute may want it.  GILLLIGAN Well, golly thanks folks. This is the happiest day of my life.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  (CONTINUED) And I don't deserve all that credit. And I want to thank those who really helped me. Skipper, professor, Ginger. But most of all I'd like to thank, Mary Ann and her pancakes!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER Gee Gilligan, you make me home sick for Hollywood. And the Oscar awards.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan looks a little embarrassed.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Ah…the patch…  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR …ought to be ready skipper.  SKIPPER Lets find out!  The skipper gives the plank a good healthy tug.  PROFESSOR It's permanent! Absolutely permanent!  GINGER Oh great!  MARY ANN Oh!!!

CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  MARY ANN Oh hurry, lets go pack!  GINGER Wait, here I come.  Ginger and Mary Ann run off camera.  PROFESSOR Skipper, be right back!  The professor runs off camera as well followed by the skipper.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan sees the bucket of glue and sticks his finger in for a taste.  PAN RIGHT WITH GILLIGAN TO SKIPPER  We see the skipper working on another plank to patch a hole farther aft on the hull.  GILLIGAN Skipper?  SKIPPER Yes Gilligan?  GILLIGAN Well sir a well…a, I was wondering, would you do me a favor?  SKIPPER What is it?  GILLIGAN Well I, Well I…I…I  SKIPPER Go on!  GILLIGAN Ah, can I help too sir?

Why don't you go out and get some palm leaves.  GILLIGAN Aye, aye sir.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  Gilligan turns to leave. He has to step over some planks leaning against the boat. In the process he looks back at the skipper and doesn't watch where he's going. He ends up stepping in the bucket of glue.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF BUCKET OF GLUE  He partially pulls his foot out only to realize it's stuck in the bucket with long elastic strings of glue.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is trying to shake the bucket loose from his foot.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN WITH SKIPPER IN BG  He's still trying to shake the bucket loose.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper notices Gilligan's actions and looks up.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF BUCKET OF GLUE  We see Gilligan's foot as he tries to get it out of the bucket. It's being held loosely by stringy glue.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper becomes curious and stands up to watch Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF BUCKET OF GLUE  Same as before. His shoe with long stringy elastic glue holding it to the bucket.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is still trying to shake the bucket loose.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper sees what's wrong and does a slow burn into the camera.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan finally frees the bucket from his foot. He tosses the bucket aside and is standing on one leg as he tries to adjust himself. He's got glue all over his foot and hand.  SKIPPER Gilligan.  In response to the skipper, Gilligan panics and tries to hide his foot by putting it behind him and up against the boots hull, where it promptly gets stuck.  ZOOM IN WITH SKIPPER TO GILLIGAN FOR CLOSE UP  SKIPPER What are you hiding?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Me hiding? Where what what what hiding who what what what hiding what who… Skipper, I got a confession to make. I got a stuck foot.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN'S STUCK FOOT TO HULL  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER I thought so.  GILLIGAN Please help me huh skipper?  SKIPPER Yes Gilligan I'll help you.

SKIPPER Say ah, what are you build....What's a birdhouse!?  GILLIGAN What I'm building.  You just asked me.  SKIPPER No I didn't.  I was going to ask you, but you told me before I asked you.  In fact you told me about where the professor was, before I did ask you.  GILLIGAN Don't be Silly, I can't read your mind.  SKIPPER Well then...how...can you tell what I'm thinking!?    FADE OUT:            ACT ONE  FADE IN: ESTABLISING SHOT - EXT - BEACH - DAY  GILLIGAN Don't be silly I can't read your mind!  SKIPPER But you just did it Gilligan!  Let's try once more and I'll try and think of something.  GILLIGAN Your thinking you shouldn't have had that fourth piece of coconut cream pie you ate for dinner last night.  SKIPPER That's right Gilligan!    I just don't know.....Oh I know how, now just a minute I gave you a clue.  GILLIGAN You didn't say a word!  SKIPPER No but my stomach growled (he laughs) Now this time.....  GILLIGAN You can keep your eyes open this time if you want.  SKIPPER Oh it's a trick of some sort. Gilligan this time you keep your eyes closed and I'll keep my eyes open and think of something that I haven't thought about in a long time.  GILLIGAN Your thinking about a hula dancer and a grass skirt.....Skipper!  SKIPPER Gilligan your right, never mind now the rest of it.....ep.....ep..... Gilligan I don't understand how you do this!?   GILLIGAN I don't know, I'm just standing here.    SKIPPER Let ME stand there!  Now YOU think of something. (pause)  GILLIGAN OK.  SKIPPER Well are you thinking of something?  GILLIGAN Uh-huh  SKIPPER I'm not getting any message. What are you thinking about?  GILLIGAN I was thinking about the time when I was ten years old and skinned my knee and Rudolf my cousin and his friend Claud we were going to the movies with Freddie with two teeth missing.....  SKIPPER OH! Never mind Gilligan for goodness sake, how can I understand what your thinking when I can't even understand what your saying!?  CUT TO: OUTSIDE OF HUT WITH EVERYONE ELSE SEATED AND STANDING AROUND THE TABLE.  SKIPPER Hey everybody, Gilligan can read minds, it's the most fantastic think you've ever seen, my little buddy can read minds!  PROFESSOR Skipper nobody can read minds, it's a scientific impossibility.  SKIPPER Oh no now wait a minute professor, just a minute lets show him little buddy. Now you tell him what I'm thinking.  GILLIGAN You're thinking about that hula dancer in the grass skirt.  SKIPPER That's right Gilligan! I even tried to fool him and I couldn't!     PROFESSOR Skipper, just because you said he read your mind doesn't mean he read it.  SKIPPER Oh now wait a minute professor.....All right then you think of something and he'll read YOUR mind.  PROFESSOR Oh really Skipper! (Sarcastically)  SKIPPER Oh come on professor just think of something.  GINGER Oh go ahead, humor him professor.  PROFESSOR Well all right go ahead.  GILLIGAN Ah, the symbol for Aluminum is AL, its atomic number is thirteen, its atomic weight is twenty-six point nine seven.  GINGER Did he really read your mind professor?  PROFESSOR Well it must be some sort of a trick, I mean it's impossible to read minds!  SKIPPER Well try him again professor, try him again!  PROFESSOR I will, I will!  GILLIGAN The index of refraction is N equals SINE one over SINE R equals V one over V two.  SKIPPER Is that right!    PROFESSOR Well there's no doubt about it, Gilligan read my mind!  GILLIGAN I must have, I don't even know what I said!    MARY ANN Oh Gilligan, oh Gilligan read my mind!  GILLIGAN Um, let's see now. Your thinking of a double thick chocolate malted.....with whip cream on it.  MARY ANN Oh, I was just thinking about a double thick chocolate malted.  GILLIGAN The whip cream was my idea.  GINGER Gilligan. Would you read my mind?  GILLIGAN Ya.....Your thinking of Rockery Hudpeck.  SKIPPER Rockery Hudpeck!?  GINGER Why he's right.  I was thinking of Rock Hudson and Gregory Peck but I couldn't make up my mind!  MR HOWELL Ah, Gilligan my boy would you come over here? There you are, sit down. Say that you can read minds, uh, read mine. Of course of course you realize the Howell mind is a little different, it's got a.....so I'll just give it a.......  GILLIGAN You're hoping that the prices on your chemical stocks have gone up.  MR Howell That's right, it's a lucky guess, I dare you to try it again. Just, just try it again.....I'll give it the double.....   GILLIGAN Your thinking that if you could read minds like me you'd have all the money in the world.  MR Howell That's what I was thinking, but then that's what I'm always thinking!   GINGER & MARY ANN Gilligan, Gilligan read my mind.....  MR Howell Wait a minute girls!  Girls, girls control yourself control your self, treat this man with awe and respect!  GINGER He's only just Gilligan.  MR Howell Well he's Gilligan to you, but to me, he's my little Fort Knox!  GINGER & MARY ANN Oh come on Mr. Howell!  MR HOWELL (yells) AAAAHHHHH!  CUT TO: INT - HOWELLS HUT - DAY  Mrs. Howell is pacing back and forth in the hut as MR Howell sits on the bed with an alarm clock.  The alarm clock goes off.  MR HOWELL All right my dear it's my turn.  MRS HOWELL Dear Thurston, how long do we have to do this pacing thing?  MR HOWELL Until we figure out how Gilligan reads minds.  MRS HOWELL Well why don't we just walk up to him and ask him?  MR HOWELL Well I did, I did, and he said that he didn't know.  MRS HOWELL Oh well you can believe him. If there's one thing that boy can't do is tell an untruth.  MR HOWELL Yes I know, I know my dear, it's, it's so revolting!  MRS HOWELL Maybe it's the shape of Gilligan's head.   MR HOWELL The shape of his head has nothing to do with it. My uncle Eggburt's head is more pointed than his and he can't even read a menu.  ALARM GOES OFF AGAIN AND THEY CHANGE PLACES.  MRS HOWELL There you are dear.  Maybe Gilligan is having some sort of a nightmare.  MR HOWELL  You can't read minds as a result of a nightmare.  I'm having a nightmare because I can't!  MRS HOWELL I mean maybe Gilligan, Ah, ate something that disagreed with him.  MR HOWELL Lovey, Lovey, that's it! That's it, that's his secret! The food, the thing that he eats!  MRS HOWELL Well he does have a most peculiar diet.  MR HOWELL I shall eat the same combination of calories, proteins, carbohydrates and mud!  MRS HOWELL Oh darling, remember you have a very delicate tummy.  MR HOWELL Well let it suffer. I've got to get that secret.  MRS HOWELL Oh yes dear, but you'll toss and turn all night.  MR HOWELL Let me toss, let me turn.  To get that secret I'll become a whirling dervish!         CUT TO: Mr. Howell and Gilligan are seen eating at a table covered with all sorts of different foods.  MR HOWELL Clams, Oysters, Lobsters, Turtle eggs in the shell and warm coconut milk.  How can a skinny kid like you hold so much?  GILLIGAN I don't know Mr. Howell, not until I've had a dessert.  Gilligan looks up as he smells something in the air.  GILLIGAN Oh! Mary Ann is cooking my favorite! Coconut, Papaya and Tuna fish pie! Mmmm, come on Mr. Howell, it's best when it's hot!  Gilligan gets up and walks off camera as Mr. Howell slowly gets up and heads for his hut.   CUT TO:  INT - HOWELL'S HUT - DAY  Mr. Howell is seen slowly walking to his bed and laying down as Mrs. Howell tries to zip up her cloths.  MR HOWELL I feel like a beached whale!  MRS HOWELL Thurston, this isn't the time for a siesta Zip me up.  Mr. Howell tries to reach up to zip up Mrs. Howell and can't make it.  He falls back onto the bed.  MR HOWELL AAAHHH.....Can't make it.   MRS HOWELL Don't be ridiculous you've got to get up.  MR HOWELL Why?  MRS HOWELL Well it's time for dinner!  MR HOWELL AAAAHHHH!    CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY Gilligan is laying on a lounge chair as Ginger sits with a pad and pencil looking like a psychiatrist.  GILLIGAN .....I had a happy childhood.  GINGER Gilligan you've got to wait till I ask the question before you answer it!  GILLIGAN Ok, but I can't see how your going to figure out how I read minds by asking me what happened when I was a kid.  GINGER Well I think I can.  Now.....Did your father ever beat you?  GILLIGAN Yes.  GINGER He did!?  GILLIGAN All the time.  GINGER And your mother let him!?  GILLIGAN She use to beat me too.  GINGER Oh you poor thing!  GILLIGAN How else could I learn to play checkers?  GINGER Gilligan will you be serious!?  GILLIGAN I'm sorry.  GINGER Now let's try something else. Um.....AH.....A word association test. I'll say a word and you say the first thing that pops into your head.      GILLIGAN (Immediately after Ginger finishes last line) Black  GINGER I didn't say it!  (PAUSE)  GINGER Dog  GILLIGAN Cat  GINGER Ham  GILLIGAN Eggs  GINGER Sun  GILLIGAN Moon  GINGER Boy  GILLIGAN Oh.....A.....Oh boy.....Atta boy!?  GINGER How about girl?  GILLIGAN (Thinks a moment) Yeah!  Boy girl!, yeah  Gilligan hands Ginger some seeds to eat.  GILLIGAN Here, have some.  GINGER Oh Gilligan it's no use. Even Sigmond Fraud couldn't solve this  She pauses and starts to walk out.  IF I see him I'll tell him.  GILLIGAN Tell who?   GINGER The Skipper.  You just asked me..... Gilligan I just read your mind!  GILLIGAN How did you do it? How do I do it? How do we do it?  GINGER (holds up seed) This!  GILLIGAN So that's how we do it!  GINGER Then they can't be ordinary sun flower seeds.  GILLIGAN Guess not.  GINGER Well,just to make sure it's the seed, let's try to read each others mind.  GILLIGAN Ok....... (pause) I know what your thinking.  GINGER I know what YOUR thinking.  GILLIGAN I know you know what I'm thinking.  GINGER I know that you know that I know that you know what your thinking.  GILLIGAN I know that you know that I know that you know that I know you know what I'm thinking.....I think.  GINGER I know that you know that I know what your thinking, that I.....that's right, let's go tell the others.  FADE OUT:        ACT TWO  FADE IN: ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LAGOON  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY The skipper and the professor are still having an argument about reading minds.  SKIPPER ...And I still say that Gilligan can read minds!  PROFESSOR Medical science says he can't!  SKIPPER  Well medical science is wrong!  PROFESSOR Medical science is NEVER wrong!  Gilligan and Ginger come running on camera  GILLIGAN Hey, hey Ginger can read minds just like me!  GINGER That's right I can read minds just like Gilligan! Even if HE doesn't think so.  SKIPPER And WHAT does medical science think about THAT!?  PROFESSOR Well, in order to justify such a fantastic claim, I would have to perform laboratory tests with strict controls.    SKIPPER Oh never mind professor for goodness sakes. I'll test her myself. Now go ahead Ginger, start reading.  GINGER AH...,thirty six, twenty two, thirty six (She gives the skipper the tisk tisk tisk sound)  SKIPPER Oh well Ginger I was trying to figure out the longitude and latitude of....this Island.    GILLIGAN Oh no you weren't skipper.  You were thinking about Ginger's....  SKIPPER Never mind Gilligan.  Alright now...ah.professor you go ahead, you test her.  PROFESSOR All right Ginger, read my mind.  GINGER Thirty six, twenty two, thirty six.  PROFESSOR We...well that's just the atomic weight of sodium hydrochloride.  GILLIGAN OH no professor, you were thinking about Ginger's.....  PROFESSOR Never mind Gilligan, all right Ginger what happened? Did Gilligan tell you...  GINGER Gilligan didn't teach me anything.  All you have to do is eat one of these sun flower seeds, which isn't a sunflower seed at all!  PROFESSOR Why that's fantastic!  You know there's a chapter on these seeds in my book on rare tropical plants.  It says the last bush died over three centuries ago.    SKIPPER Well who ever wrote that book is a blooming idiot.  PROFESSOR Well I'll ignore that, but according to legend, which now appears to be fact, these seeds were used by the ancient mystics to induce telepathic communication, a form of mind reading.  GILLIGAN And it works professor!      PROFESSOR Well, I'll have to re-read that chapter.  Professor gets up and leaves.  Ginger gets up also and runs after the professor.  GINGER Oh professor, my seed!  Skipper stretches and pretends to be tired.  SKIPPER Oh hum little buddy, I think it's time to hit the sack.  GILLIGAN That's not what your thinking. Your thinking that if you get me alone you'll make me tell you where the bush is.  SKIPPER Who me!?  Now Gilligan...  CUT TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT Gilligan is in the bottom hammock and the skipper is in the top sleeping.  SKIPPER Gilligan.  Gilligan.  I've always taken care of you haven't I? It's always been share and share alike with us hasn't it?  GILLIGAN Please skipper I'm trying to get some sleep.  SKIPPER All I'm asking is one simple thing.  Let's keep the location of that bush a secret. Just between you and me. OK?  Gilligan starts to snore.  SKIPPER Gilligan.  Gilligan.  I've always taken care of you haven't I? I mean, it's always been share and share alike with us hasn't it?  GILLIGAN Oh who put that record back on again.  SKIPPER Gilligan. Just say yes and then you can go back to sleep.     GILLIGAN Yes what?  SKIPPER Just say yes skipper.  GILLIGAN Yes skipper.  Skipper thinks he's gotten through to Gilligan and is pleased with himself.  He goes back to sleep.  CUT TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Mrs. Howell is in bed and Mr. Howell is sitting on the edge of his bed thinking.  MRS HOWELL Thurston, aren't you ever going to sleep?  MR HOWELL I'm thinking.  MRS Howell What about?  MR HOWELL Those seeds of course.  MRS HOWELL Gilligan promised to show us the mind reading bush in the morning.   MR HOWELL I just don't trust him.  MRS HOWELL Don't trust Gilligan!?  But that's ridiculous, he's the sole of honor.  MR HOWELL Well it so happens the sole of honor is bunking with Sinbad the Sailor.  MRS HOWELL Oh, you don't mean you don't trust the captain?  MR HOWELL That kind of trust made Julius Caesar a pin cushion my dear, yes.   Mr. Howell walks out of the hut.   MRS HOWELL I never knew that Julius Caesar was a pincushion?  CUT TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Mr. Howell enters Gilligan's hut.  MR HOWELL Gilligan are you asleep?

MR HOWELL Ah...Sixty-Forty   GILLIGAN Sixty-forty?  MR HOWELL Seventy-thirty, that's final, I won't let you take anything less.  GILLIGAN Ok Mr. Howell I'll sleep on it.  MR HOWELL And tomorrow you put the seeds in my hands for safe keeping, right?  No need to answer my boy.  Just a simple nod of the head.  Mr. Howell physically moves Gilligan's head up and down in a nodding motion.  MR HOWELL That's it, yes indeed, perfectly legal...even have a witness.  Mr. Howell leaves Gilligan's hut just as he sees Ginger walking over the Gilligan's hut.  They see each other and both fake sleep walking.  After Mr. Howell is out of sight, Ginger goes in to the hut.   CUT TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  GINGER Gilligan  GILLIGAN SHHHHHH...Gilligan is sleeping.  GINGER Wake up I've got to talk to you.

She kisses Gilligan who promptly starts to snore.  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Everyone is seated around the table except Gilligan who's nowhere to be seen.  SKIPPER Oh I don't know how Gilligan could break a promise to his big buddy.  GINGER It's the last time I share a secret with him!  MR HOWELL Who'd believe Gilligan could pull a trick like that.  MRS HOWELL Well darling, what did he say to you when you went to visit him in the night?  Mr. Howell shushes her.  PROFESSOR I don't know why your all so upset.  GINGER Well Gilligan just up and left without saying where he was going.  MARY ANN Oh that's not true. He told me he was going to go out and get the seeds and bring them back here.  SKIPPER Bring them here!?  With all of us watching!?  GINGER I'll never trust him again.    MR HOWELL Well if you could read his mind you'd know exactly where he went.  GINGER I tried that last night but it didn't work.  PROFESSOR The effect is only temporary.  I did some reading about those seeds last night...  Gilligan enters on camera from behind the hut.  GILLIGAN Hi everybody!  I'm back!  I promised plenty of seeds for everyone and here they are!  He holds up six bags of seeds. Everyone leaps up and scrambles to get a bag from Gilligan.    CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY  The Howells are seated back to back getting ready to read each others mind.  MR HOWELL Ready Lovey?  MRS HOWELL Ready.  Both eat a seed.  MRS HOWELL Rather like the flavor of truffles haven't they.  MR HOWELL Never mind what they taste like, lets just see if they work.   MRS HOWELL I think a little Hollandaise sauce would improve the them.  MR HOWELL This isn't a receipt contest, now Lovey, Um...think of something.  MRS HOWELL All right.  (giggles)  Ready.  MR HOWELL You've changed your mind.  Instead of Hollandaise sauce, you think they'd taste better with sauce bernaise.  MRS HOWELL Oh darling how clever of you! You read my mind exactly!  MR HOWELL Yes, now now I'll I'll think of somethings Better take a booster shot.  He eats another seed.  MRS HOWELL Really Thurston how can you!?  MR HOWELL But Lovey!  MRS HOWELL I don't mind you stealing from the others, but to steal seeds from your own wife!  Oh! Oh! Why did I ever marry you!? Oh!  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Skipper and Gilligan are repairing the outside of the hut.  Skipper is standing on a box while Gilligan helps him.  GILLIGAN OK skipper sure.  Here it is.  He hands skipper a hammer.  SKIPPER This mined reading sure beats talking a mile. I don't have to give every order twice!  GILLIGAN A lot quieter too.  Gilligan winces with pain.  GILLIGAN Do you have to yell that loud!?  SKIPPER Why I didn't say a word.  GILLIGAN Yeah, but you were thinking so loudly.    SKIPPER Hand me that bamboo pole.  Gilligan grabs a pole and as he backs up, he accidentally pushes the skipper through the wall of the hut that he was repairing.  SKIPPER Gilligan!  You are...you...  GILLIGAN A nincompoop, that's what your thinking!  SKIPPER EXACTLY!  And not only that I...  What do you mean if I hadn't been so fat this wouldn't have happened!  GILLIGAN Oh!

Mr. Howell passes the professor who is sitting at a table as Gilligan walks up to the professor.  GILLIGAN Hi professor can I talk to you?  PROFESSOR Wouldn't you prefer to think at me?  GILLIGAN NO it's the last thing I want to do.  I just had a terrible think fight with the skipper. You should have heard some of the terrible thoughts he thought at me.  PROFESSOR Well it's not just you and the skipper.  The girls aren't speaking to each other, and the Howells have just had a violent argument. Actually, considering all the months we've spent on this island, those are the first real fights we've had.  GILLIGAN I thought we'd just get along great if everybody could read each other's minds.  PROFESSOR So did I.  You know, I thought those seeds might even help world peace when we're rescued.  I thought that if all the countries in the world could only... What do mean that's a stupid idea!?  GILLIGAN All I mean is if the seven of us taking the seeds just can't get along...  PROFESSOR I know what you mean, but that's no reason to be insulting!  The professor gets up and storms off camera.  CUT TO: Everyone is around the table looking upset and arguing. Gilligan sees everyone arguing and walks off into the jungle.   GINGER You don't think I do my share of the work do you!?  MARY ANN I didn't say that!  GINGER But you thought it!  MARY ANN Hah! So you think you do more work around here than I do! Hah that's a laugh!   GINGER OH! So I loaf and try to get Gilligan and skipper to do my work do I!?  Well!  CUT TO: Professor and skipper.  PROFESSOR I should stop using my head and start using my back for a change huh!?  SKIPPER Well I...Oh well you've got a lot of nerve thinking that if it wasn't for you, we couldn't have survived all this time!  CUT TO: The Howells arguing.  MRS HOWELL If I knew you had thoughts like that I never would have married you!  MR HOWELL Well I'm finding out a few things that you think, and how few thinks you have!  MRS HOWELL OH PEW!!  MR HOWELL PEW!!  CUT TO: Ginger, skipper and Mary Ann arguing.  GINGER Mary Ann is under the impression that I've been getting you to do my work for me.  She reacts with surprise.  So YOU think so too!?  Well do you know what I think!?  SKIPPER I most certainly do! OH!  MARY ANN And that goes for me too!  Both Ginger and Mary Ann storm off camera.  Mr. Howell walks up to the skipper.  MR HOWELL Well they certainly told you off.  SKIPPER Oh I couldn't care less what they think.  It burns me up, the professor thinks that I...  OH, so you think I'm responsible for our being marooned too!!  MR HOWELL Well it certainly wasn't my fault!  Mrs. Howell comes up to Mr. Howell.  MRS HOWELL Thurston give me some of your seeds I'm all out of them and I want to read your mind.  MR HOWELL Well I haven't any more.  I'll go back to the bush and get some more.  SKIPPER Not if I get em first!   CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - Day  We see Gilligan setting the bush on fire. The others are looking for Gilligan.  SKIPPER I think I saw Gilligan go this way.  MR HOWELL I'll pay the rest of you a thousand dollars a piece for the seeds.  PROFESSOR Well there he is!     SKIPPER Where...Gilligan!  What are you doing there little buddy?  GILLIGAN I'm burning the bush with the mind reading seeds.  MR HOWELL Th...The seeds, the seeds!  Mr. Howell runs to the bush and trys to grab it.  MR HOWELL OW!! That smarts, I burned my little pinky!  PROFESSOR Did you burn all the seeds?  GILLIGAN Yep, the whole bush and everything.  Oh I suppose you think it's the dumbest thing I ever did.  But we never fought and argued before we could read minds.  And now that we can't read minds, maybe we could be friends again? Huh?   OK if everybody wants to yell at me for being a dumb bell go ahead.  PROFESSOR Gilligan, for a guy who's always doing dumb things.  When you do something smart, it's beautiful.  Professor walks off camera  GILLIGAN And your not mad? (to Mr. Howell)  MR HOWELL No I'm not mad, even though I lost a fortune. (He walks off camera)  SKIPPER Gilligan?  GILLIGAN Hmm?  SKIPPER You know what I think?   GILLIGAN No I don't  SKIPPER Well it's a shame because, really it was something nice.  GILLIGAN Thanks skipper.

OPEN UP THAT GOLDEN GATE CAUSE SAN FRANCISCO HERE I COME!  The professor reaches over and turns off the radio.  SKIPPER Professor, according to my new calculations, she should be passing right over our island.  PROFESSOR Well there must be someway we can contact her.  SKIPPER But how!?  The skipper thinks for a moment.  SKIPPER I got it! I've got it!! What we need is a big roaring fire!  Gilligan walks on camera carrying a sack over his shoulder.

GILLIGAN Especially me, I'm the worst of the whole bunch.  The professor stretches his arms and sounds tired.  PROFESSOR I think I'm going to lay down. I'm beat.  The professor walks off camera leaving Gilligan to guard the skipper's rest. Gilligan has a curious look on his face and decides to check in on the skipper.  CUT TO: INT - SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN'S HUT - DAY  The skipper is lying in his hammock with his eyes closed. Gilligan comes through the door quietly and looks at the skipper.

He places the sign on the hut's outer wall and is about to nail it in place when the professor comes out of the hut. Just as Gilligan is making his swing, the professor takes the hammer, spinning Gilligan around. Before Gilligan can utter a word, the professor puts his hand over Gilligan's mouth. Gilligan is mumbling something but can't be understood.  PROFESSOR Shhhhhh!  Gilligan settles down a bit.  PROFESSOR No noise Gilligan, the skipper's almost asleep.  GILLIGAN Oh.

The skipper is just wheeling around out of control as Gilligan and the professor try to guide him.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  They are still unable to control his direction.

The professor is listening on the small radio to see if the skipper's is coming through. He shakes his head.  PROFESSOR Nothing. Still doesn't work.  SKIPPER Are you sure you wrote those instructions down correctly?  PROFESSOR I'm positive.  GILLIGAN Are you sure you dreamed the instructions correctly?  SKIPPER Well there's no use fooling around with this any more she's probably out of range by now.  PROFESSOR Yes I'm afraid so.

He puts the small radio up to his ear and starts try the transmitter again.  GILLIGAN Testing one two three four. Testing one two.  Gilligan stops and starts hitting the transmitter with his fist and tries again.  GILLIGAN Hello hello can anybody hear me?  Just then the radio comes alive.  RADIO NICE TO TALK TO YOU YOUNG MAN!

Gilligan hits the transmitter again with his fist several times and the back opens up, and the electronics falls out.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  The skipper as a shocked look on his face.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan leans over the transmitter and looks inside. All the internal parts are lying on the ground.  PAN UP WITH GILLIGAN TO SKIPPER  GILLIGAN Come to think of it. I guess I dreamed the whole thing.  SKIPPER Of course you did.  We hear an airplane-flying overhead as the small radio comes to life. The skipper and Gilligan follow the sound as they look up.

FADE OUT    END CREDITS   GILLIGAN'S ISLAND Good Night, Sweet Skipper 
Episode #19, “Gilligan Meets Jungle Boy” Gilligan finds a young jungle boy on the island, as well as a helium supply that the professor plans to use to get rescued with a makeshift hot-air balloon.  “Gilligan Meets Jungle Boy”  By  Al Schwartz,  Howard Merrill,  and  Howard Harris  February 6, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan picks a banana from a bunch of bananas hanging near a jungle path. He hums to himself while peeling the banana when out of nowhere he hears a strange almost chimpanzee-like screech, yet not entirely un-human. Gilligan freezes and the banana falls. GILLIGAN Who's there? Maybe it‘s a man-eating lion or a hungry tiger. But lions and tigers aren't on deserted islands. Are you? A small boy, about eight years old, peers from around a tree behind Gilligan. The small boy observes Gilligan from the nearby tree. He puts his hand to his mouth and makes repeated KISSING SOUNDS. Gilligan looks over toward the sound. GILLIGAN (cont'd) It‘s a boy. The Jungle boy climbs the tree. GILLIGAN (cont'd) It's a Jungle Boy! Gilligan watches as the Jungle boy climbs the tree. GILLIGAN (cont'd) No, wait. Kid, wait. Take it easy. Don‘t go away now. Wait for me, kid! Wait for me. The Jungle boy lets out the same strange chimpanzee-like vocalization and swings from the tree on a vine and exits. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Wait for me, kid. Wait for me. Gilligan climbs a tree also and grabs another vine. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hey, wait for me! Don't go away, kid. Here I come, kid. Gilligan tries to imitate the boy's chimpanzee screech. He grabs a vine and leaps. He swings in the opposite direction from the boy. Gilligan slowly swings out and then back to the tree where he comes to rest with a disappointed look. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. CAMP - DAY CLOSEUP PALM FROND FAN the fan spins. PAN UP TO the Professor pedaling the bike, which powers the fan. PULL BACK TO the Skipper lying on a lounge chair as the Professor pedals the bike which powers the bamboo and palm frond fan. SKIPPER Professor, that works great. Just like a regular fan. PROFESSOR Better. You don't get a bill from the electric company every month. SKIPPER Yeah. Why don't you get it patented? PROFESSOR (jokingly) Well, I wrote to Washington, but I don't think the bottle ever got there. Gilligan runs up in an agitated state. GILLIGAN Skipper, Skipper, Skipper, you should have seen him swinging from tree to tree. SKIPPER Who, Gilligan, who? GILLIGAN A boy. A Jungle Boy. One minute he was there, the next he was gone. Then he was back again. SKIPPER Well, I'm glad he got back, I was beginning to miss him. GILLIGAN There's a boy out there, honest Skipper. The Skipper points to himself and then the Professor. SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan. (mockingly) Me, Tarzan, (points to Professor) you Jane, (points to Gilligan) him boy. GILLIGAN No. The boy's small. Hard to tell. He's always swinging from the trees. SKIPPER (sternly) Gilligan, once and for all I've had it. I have had it! GILLIGAN Had what? SKIPPER You and your fantastic stories. PROFESSOR You sure it wasn't a monkey, Gilligan? GILLIGAN No, no, a monkey is short, real short and has hair all over it and kind of goes -- Gilligan makes chimpanzee BABBLES, complete with body scratching and facial expressions. SKIPPER Well, Gilligan, I've never seen you look so natural. Skipper laughs. PROFESSOR We've searched this island and there is nobody else here. GILLIGAN He's out there. I can prove it. Just follow me. SKIPPER Gilligan, I do not believe you. But this time I gonna make you admit that you don't believe you, either. GILLIGAN Yeah? EXT. JUNGLE - DAY The Skipper and Gilligan look for the Jungle boy. GILLIGAN This is where I found him. I think he lives in that tree. SKIPPER (sarcastically) Well, Gilligan, why don't we knock on the tree and see if he's home? GILLIGAN Skipper, I saw him, honest. I was right on this very spot a little while ago. SKIPPER Well, obviously he's not here now, Gilligan, so let's go back. GILLIGAN Wait a minute, Skipper, wait a minute. Honest. I saw him. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Gilligan calls out. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Boy! Oh, boy! JUNGLE BOY watches them from the tree. Gilligan spots the boy. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN (cont'd) There he is! The Skipper looks up and discovers a bird in the tree. BIRD IN A TREE making all sorts of BIRD SOUNDS. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER Gilligan, you didn't tell me that he had feathers. GILLIGAN Honest, I just saw him. Boy, oh, boy! Gilligan looks up into the jungle canopy searching for the Jungle boy. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I hear him. I hear him. I hear him. Gilligan looks up and follows the sound with his eyes. GILLIGAN (cont'd) He's back in the tree. Gilligan looks up. The Skipper takes off his hat, leans back and looks up. An egg drops down from above and hits him in the face. The Skipper holds back his anger. Gilligan turns his back to the Skipper and looks sheepish. SKIPPER Gilligan, that wasn't even a boy bird! FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - LATER The Jungle boy swings through the jungle and lands behind Gilligan who sits on a dead log. The Jungle boy approaches from behind and makes the same kissing sounds he made earlier. GILLIGAN Don't do that. I know you're not there. The Jungle boy walks towards Gilligan and meets him face to face. Gilligan immediately gets up and grabs him by the arm. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Well, where were you when I needed you? Skipper! JUNGLE BOY Skipper! The jungle smiles as he mimics. GILLIGAN Anybody! JUNGLE BOY Anybody! Gilligan gives the Jungle boy a stern look. GILLIGAN Don't do that. The Jungle boy thinks it's funny. JUNGLE BOY Don't do that. GILLIGAN What do you know, little Sir Echo. The Jungle boy is holding a coconut and signals Gilligan to go play with him. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Huh? No. Look, I don't have time to play catch. Look, look I got to take you back to camp. Come back with me to camp. The Jungle boy tosses the coconut to Gilligan who catches it. Gilligan tosses the coconut back. JUNGLE BOY catches the coconut Gilligan tossed. He tosses the coconut again. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan catches the coconut while he is still trying to get through to the Jungle boy. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Do you understand? No response from the boy. GILLIGAN (cont'd) No you don't understand. Listen, you know, come back. JUNGLE BOY just smiles. GILLIGAN (O.S.) No, we're not going to get any place this way. The Jungle boy signals Gilligan to follow him. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN You want to play follow the leader? Okay, five minutes, and then I gotta take you back to camp, okay? Gilligan and the Jungle boy play follow the leader through the jungle. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - LATER The Jungle boy swings in the trees. Gilligan swings on another vine. GILLIGAN Hey, kid, wait for me! Gilligan swings, but is too low on the vine and ends up skidding along the ground on his bottom. EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Gilligan and the Jungle boy end up in a clearing near a raised mound of dirt. In the center of the mound is a rock. We can hear the sound of escaping gas as he approaches. GILLIGAN Watch it! Look out! What's that? The Jungle boy takes the rock off the mound and takes a coconut and places it over the hole. The coconut rises gently into the air and floats. Gilligan stares in amazement at the coconut as it floats in the air. He places his hand over the hole emitting the gas and the coconut goes down. Jungle boy watches Gilligan having fun with the coconut. Gilligan takes the coconut from the air and hands it to the Jungle boy. Gilligan leans over to look in hole. In doing so, his hat lifts into the air on the rising column of gas. The Jungle boy laughs in amusement. Gilligan looks up in the air at his hat. He tries to reach up and get his hat, but it's too high. Gilligan leans over the hole with his arms and blocks the gas flow. GILLIGAN'S HAT comes down as Gilligan blocks the gas flow. PAN DOWN AS Gilligan grabs his hat and puts it back on. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Wait till the Skipper sees this and wait till he sees you. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Give me the rock and I'll cap it. You know, the rock. The rock? The Jungle boy understands after Gilligan points and hands him the rock. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Thanks. Thanks. The rock weighs more than Gilligan thought and he nearly drops it. He caps the mound with the rock. GILLIGAN (cont'd) All right, come on. Let's go back to camp. The boy doesn't respond. GILLIGAN (cont'd) You know, follow the leader? Remember? Follow the leader? Remember? This way. come on. Gilligan is bent over and hopping like in leapfrog. As he does so, the Jungle boy understands and begins laughing at Gilligan's antics. Both he and Gilligan go hopping off into the jungle as we... FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY We see the Skipper riding the bike unit that's hooked to the washing machine. Mary Ann is standing by to handle the load of wash. The Skipper is getting impatient waiting for the laundry to be through. SKIPPER How much longer, Mary Ann? MARY ANN We're almost to the rinse cycle, Skipper. SKIPPER Sometimes I think the Professor invents too many things. Mr. Howell walks from behind one of the huts. He sees the Skipper riding the bike and launches himself into song. MR HOWELL Ha..ho! (singing) This is the way we wash our clothes, wash our clothes, wash our clothes. This is the way we wash our clothes so early in the morning! SKIPPER Mister Howell, how would you like it if I put you in the drivers seat? MR HOWELL Sir, are you suggesting that I stoop to manual labor? SKIPPER Congratulations. You got it right the first time. MR HOWELL Would you ask a man with a chronic sacroiliac and a strangulated disk to do a thing like that? SKIPPER You've got all those things? MR HOWELL Don't evade the issue. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan bends over and hops through the jungle. They see Gilligan and stare in surprise. Gilligan hops along. EXT. CAMP - DAY The group watches Gilligan's antics. Gilligan hops up and stops in front of them. Gilligan remains bent over. SKIPPER All right, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Made it. SKIPPER Come on, Frank Buck, stand up straight. GILLIGAN You gotta help me, Skipper. MR HOWELL No use, Gilligan. The Skipper is an enemy of medical science. The Skipper gets off the bike and uses his knee in Gilligan's back to help straighten him up. SKIPPER (to Mr. Howell) His back is fine. It's his head I'm worried about. (to Gilligan) You still having those hallucinations? GILLIGAN Nope! Found the Jungle Boy, found a kind of gas that floats things, and we played around for a while and we came back. MR HOWELL A Jungle Boy? GILLIGAN Uh-huh. Like the one over there. Gilligan points over to where the Jungle boy is waiting. The Skipper has his back to the boy so he can't see him. He also doesn't even turn around to look. JUNGLE BOY just watches from a distance. SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan, if you say "Jungle Boy" once more, I'll... BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL A Jungle Boy! GILLIGAN He said it, I didn't. SKIPPER (to Howell) You did? MR HOWELL Well, obviously, since there is a -- a Jungle Boy. SKIPPER How about you Mary Ann, do you see it too? MARY ANN It's not an "it," Skipper. It is a boy. It's a Jungle Boy. SKIPPER And I suppose that if I turn around, I'll see it, too. The Skipper turns around. The Skipper spots the Jungle boy and reacts. SKIPPER (cont'd) I see it! Come on, Gilligan, let's grab him. GILLIGAN No, Skipper, don't. SKIPPER Why not? GILLIGAN Because he swings like a monkey, swims like a fish, and runs like a deer, and I don't want to go through that again. MR HOWELL Well, if there's one attribute I do have, and that is charm. I mean, children simply adore me. They...they think of me as a rich uncle, you see. Yes. Come here, Jungle Boy. Uncle Thurston Howell the Third would like to leave you a little something in his will. The Jungle boy in the fore ground as he observes the group near the hut. Mr. Howell approaches the Jungle boy with his "charm". The Jungle boy doesn't respond. MR HOWELL (cont'd) (yells) Come here boy and that's an order! Heel! The Jungle boy doesn't react to the yelling Mr. Howell as Mary Ann comes to his rescue. MARY ANN Mr. Howell! That wouldn't even work on a cobra. MR HOWELL Cobras, indeed. The boy obviously has gone to the wrong school. Mary Ann slowly walks towards the Jungle boy. MARY ANN Hi. Come on, honey. Nobody's gonna hurt you. JUNGLE BOY smiles at Mary Ann. BACK TO SCENE Mary Ann holds out her hand. JUNGLE BOY accepts Mary Ann's invitation and walks towards her. BACK TO SCENE The Jungle boy reaches out and plays with one of Mary Ann's pigtails. MR HOWELL I say she's charmed the little nipper. GILLIGAN How'd you do that, Mary Ann? MARY ANN When fishing for boys the proper bait is girls. Mr. Howell, the Skipper and Gilligan walk over to Mary Ann and the Jungle boy SKIPPER Good work, Mary Ann. Now, maybe he can tell us something that'll help us get off the island. How long have you been here? How close are we to Hawaii, and how can we get off this island? JUNGLE BOY Island? MR HOWELL No, no, you don't seem to understand. Now -- now you tell your Uncle Thurston how to get off this ridiculous island and when we get back I'll give you a substantial reward, like matched luggage. JUNGLE BOY Luggage? MARY ANN I don't think he understands what you're saying. JUNGLE BOY Saying. SKIPPER But maybe he has some information that'll help us get off the island. Now, we've got to all try and communicate with him. The men gather around the Jungle boy. They try to talking at the same time. Mr. Howell takes out some money and waves it around. Mary Ann physically holds back the Skipper as he approaches. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, Come on young fella. MR HOWELL This is under the counter, I won't declare it. Cash. Cash. GILLIGAN Now you listen to the Skipper. Do ya hear? Pay attention now. FLIP TO: INT. GINGER AND MARY ANN'S HUT - DAY Jungle boy sits on a chair. GINGER What's your name? JUNGLE BOY Name. Mrs. Howell, Mary Ann and Ginger sit in front of the Jungle boy. MARY ANN No, let me try it, huh? GINGER It's a cinch I'm not doing any good. Mary Ann tries to establish his name by a form of reference. She points to herself. MARY ANN Mary Ann. The Jungle boy points to himself. JUNGLE BOY Mary Ann. GINGER No, no. JUNGLE BOY No, no. MRS HOWELL I'm afraid we'll have to start with the basics. Mrs. Howell points at herself and then at the boy. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Girl, boy. Next, Ginger points at her self and then at the boy. MARY ANN Girl, boy. Ginger is the last to do the same. GINGER Girl, boy. He responds in the exact same fashion as the women. He points to himself and then at each woman in sequence. JUNGLE BOY Girl, boy, boy, boy. MRS HOWELL Oh, dear, I do wish I paid more attention to those Tarzan pictures. FLIP TO: INT. GINGER AND MARY ANN'S HUT - DAY - LATER The Jungle boy is seated and Ginger uses a comb tries to make the boy more presentable. GINGER Got to make you look presentable. Your...yo...your hair is just a mess. Ginger tries to comb his hair but it just won't lay down so Ginger admits defeat. GINGER (cont'd) Hmmmm. I... I guess we'd better let you look like you. Ginger puts his hair back the way it was. GINGER (cont'd) There. Ginger holds up a mirror in front of the Jungle boy. GINGER (cont'd) Here, see how you like it. He takes one look in the mirror and screams. JUNGLE BOY Ahh! The jungle boy runs out of the hut. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELL HUT - DAY Mrs. Howell sits across the table from the Jungle boy. There is TABLEWARE on the table. MRS HOWELL First things first little boy. And the first thing is manners. JUNGLE BOY Man-ners. MRS HOWELL Right. That means the fork, or spoon, on the outside is the one that you use first. Like this. Mrs. Howell takes a bamboo fork and places it in her mouth by gripping the tines with her teeth. She signals the Jungle boy to do the same. Jungle boy picks up his fork and does the same; only he bites the tines off the fork and chews them. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT Jungle boy sleeps in a tree. Mrs. Howell wears a sad expression as she stares up at the tree. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELL HUT - NIGHT Mr. Howell pouts in bed. MR HOWELL No, Lovey, no. Definitely not. Mr. Howell sits up. MRS HOWELL (pleadingly) Thurston. MR HOWELL No, Lovey, you can ask a man just so much. MRS HOWELL But it's the only way I can get him out of the tree. MR HOWELL No, dear, no. MRS HOWELL Well, all right, Thurston, if you say so. But after all, you're a great big grown-up man and he's just a little boy. MR HOWELL Well, all right. Mr. Howell gives Mrs. Howell his teddy bear. CUT TO: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT Jungle boy sleeps holding Mr. Howell's teddy bear. MRS HOWELL (sotto) I'm afraid he'll fall out. SKIPPER (O.S.) (sotto) Oh, he's right at home. SKIPPER He'll be all right. MRS HOWELL (sotto) You know in Newport Beach, one doesn't sleep out in the backyard like that. SKIPPER (sotto) Missus Howell, he's probably been sleeping like that since he was this big. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. OCEAN - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAWN DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GAS MOUND - DAY A large rock sits atop the gas-emitting mound. Gilligan, standing nearby, takes the rock off the top and throws it down. The Skipper and Professor stand near the mound. Gilligan demonstrates the gas. GILLIGAN Here. Now watch this. Ready? Go. Gilligan places his hat over the opening and it rises in the gas stream. Every one stares in amazement and laughs. The Jungle boy is amused at Gilligan's antics. SKIPPER Well, Gilligan, I don't understand this, but I've got to admit, you were right. GILLIGAN It's really something, huh? PROFESSOR It appears to be both odorless and colorless. GILLIGAN Not only that, you can't see it or smell it. PROFESSOR Isn't that what I just said? Gilligan keeps putting his hand over the hole making his hat go up and down. Jungle boy watches and smiles. SKIPPER Oh, never mind, Professor. Young Tom Edison, you know. PROFESSOR Because of its buoyant qualities, I would say that it's either hydrogen or helium or a combination of both gases and or their properties. GILLIGAN I agree completely. SKIPPER Oh, what do you mean you agree completely? You didn't even understand what he said. GILLIGAN Right. So that's why I should agree. Mr. Howell rushes out of the jungle. SKIPPER Don't they use helium to blow up dirigibles and balloons and all that -- PROFESSOR Yes. MR HOWELL Wait a minute. Did I hear someone say there's helium on this island? PROFESSOR Helium or hydrogen. MR HOWELL Oh, what an opportunity. I can see it now. I'll form a new company. Howell's Helium and Hydrogen Corporation. PROFESSOR Please, Mister Howell, we've got important problems to solve. MR HOWELL Oh, what's more important than money? Oh, I can see it now. I'll put it up in fifths, quarts, magnums. And before I'm through, I'll have the whole country gassed. Float an issue. It floats... Everyone laughs at Mr. Howell's scheme. Gilligan floats a coconut over the mound again. The Jungle boy watches and smiles. PROFESSOR You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna use that gas to inflate a balloon and float one of us to civilization. MR HOWELL Professor, there's a place for a man like you in my organization. SKIPPER I'll take my hat off to you. GILLIGAN Professor, me, too. Gilligan leans over the gas stream. It takes his hat away again. Gilligan reaches for it. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann is pedals the stationary bike. MARY ANN The Professor's a genius. Just a few hours ago this contraption was a washing machine. Ginger sits at a crude sewing machine as she sews raincoats together. GINGER And now it's a sewing machine. I hope it works. MARY ANN Sure it will. Soon as we sew all those raincoats together and the Professor seals them with sap from a rubber tree, why, we'll have our own island airlines leaving from gate number one. GINGER Coffee, tea, or milk? MARY ANN Coffee, tea, or milk? GINGER I'm practicing to be a stewardess. JUNGLE BOY watches the girls from the foliage. EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan enters wearing a bulky raincoat. GILLIGAN Well, here I am. Last load. MARY ANN Where are the other raincoats? Gilligan removes the outer raincoat to reveal many more underneath. GILLIGAN They're underneath. It was easier to carry. JUNGLE BOY watches from the clearing's edge. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan is down to his last raincoat and it fits like a glove. GINGER Whose raincoat is that? GILLIGAN Oh, it's mine. It shrunk during the rain. FLIP TO: EXT. BALLOON CLEARING - DAY INFLATED RAINCOAT BALLOON We see a portion of the balloon made from raincoats. The arms of the raincoats are inflated and stick out in all directions. JUNGLE BOY watches them from the bushes. BACK TO SCENE PROFESSOR She's holding the Helium very well. I think this is going to work out better than I expected. GILLIGAN Looks like a trench coat for an octopus. PROFESSOR Gilligan, you make sure those lines are secure. I don't want it to float away before she's ready. The Skipper works on the lower end of a securing line that holds the balloon down. SKIPPER All right, Gilligan, make the other end of this line secure. GILLIGAN Yes, sir. Gilligan takes the other end of the Skipper's line and tries to tie it to the balloon's. He has difficulty getting enough line to do the job. He tugs on the rope and it pulls out of the Skipper's hand, leaving Skipper holding nothing. SKIPPER Gilligan, may I have my end of the line? The Skipper yanks the cord out of Gilligan's hand spinning him around in the process. Gilligan looks confused, grabs the longest portion of the rope and shows the Skipper. GILLIGAN You got the short end. You should have the long end like me. SKIPPER What are you, some kind of a knot or something? The Skipper tugs on the rope again. SKIPPER (cont'd) Well, give me some line. BAMBOO STAKE The Skipper loops his end around the STAKE and is holds it in place with his fingers. SKIPPER (O.S.) All right, Gilligan, secure the line. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan goes back to work and gives the line a strong tug to secure it and it catches the Skipper's fingers between the rope and stake. SKIPPER Aaahhhhh Ooooo!! My finger! JUNGLE BOY as he laughs at the Skipper's and Gilligan's antics. BACK TO SCENE PROFESSOR Mister Howell, how you doing with the basket? Mr. Howell weaves the basket that will be slung beneath the balloon. MR HOWELL Well, if I had known the ballast would be this heavy, I wouldn't have volunteered for the job. Uh -- uh, Professor, Skipper come here a moment. I -- I have a brilliant idea. The Professor signals the Skipper to follow and leaves what he's doing and heads over to where Mr. Howell is weaving the basket. Gilligan tries to secure more ropes and has difficulty. SKIPPER Well get around the other side where you can see what you're doing. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. The Skipper leaves Gilligan to talk with Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL Why don't we tie the provisions on, you see, in... instead of the ballast? That way we'll be killing two birds with one rope. Gilligan attempts to secure a rope, while he's under the balloons lower opening. His hat immediately floats off his head and inside the balloon. JUNGLE BOY just watches with curiosity. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan climbs on top of the mound and stands inside the balloon with only his legs showing. He begins to rise up into the balloon and out of sight. INT. BALLOON - DAY Gilligan floats in the balloon as he tries to catch his hat. The hat keeps floating out of reach. EXT. MOUND CLEARING - DAY SKIPPER Speaking of minds, where is Gilligan? The Skipper looks over towards the balloon. RAINCOAT BALLOON The inflated arms of the raincoats move like snakes as snake charming music is heard. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER (cont'd) He's inside the balloon! The men run off. INT. BALLOON - DAY Gilligan tries to capture his hat. EXT. MOUND CLEARING - DAY The Skipper and Professor try to figure out how to get Gilligan out of the balloon. PROFESSOR Wait a minute, Skip. Let me cap this Helium. The Professor puts the rock over the mounds opening. INT. BALLOON - DAY Gilligan floats as he grabs his hat. EXT. MOUND CLEARING - DAY The Skipper and Professor reach up inside the balloon and grab Gilligan by the legs. PROFESSOR Got you. I got a foot, Skipper. SKIPPER Yeah. INT. BALLOON - DAY Professor and Skipper slowly pull Gilligan out of the balloon. EXT. MOUND CLEARING - DAY SKIPPER Come down out of there, Gilligan. JUNGLE BOY who looks amused as he watches. BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL Oh, by George, that boy. Watch it! Gilligan has trouble getting his head out from beneath the balloon and it's ropes. SKIPPER Duck your head. That's it. MR HOWELL A little to the left. Gilligan is getting tangled in all the ropes as the Skipper and Professor try to free him. SKIPPER Goodness' sake, Gilligan. How do you do this? The Skipper and Professor try to holding him up. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, let's put him on that rock over there. Skipper and Professor help Gilligan stagger over to the rock and sit him down. SKIPPER (cont'd) (exhausted) Now, stay right there, and stay out of trouble. PROFESSOR Let's check that balloon. See if he did any damage. The Skipper and Professor return to the balloon. Gilligan sits on a large rock when he slips off and slides towards the ground. Before he gets to the ground he rises into the air with a surprised look on his face. Gilligan floats sky ward. Mr. Howell watches in amazement. Gilligan sails gently through the air as if he himself is a balloon. JUNGLE BOY watches from the bushes and is amused at Gilligan's flying. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan descends towards the ground. He gently steps up on the rock he was sitting on and leaps off. His facial expression says it all, he delighted. He's still floating and having a good time. The Skipper looks over at Gilligan and does a double take. Mr. Howell has a confused and worried look on his face. SKIPPER Gilligan, will you come down here? We've got a lot of work to do. The Skipper and Professor each grab Gilligan by the legs and pull him down. The Skipper and Professor think it's over and let go. GILLIGAN I'm back up again. The Skipper and Professor hold him down and are getting frustrated. PROFESSOR One thing I can think of. That's artificial respiration. Just squeeze the helium out of him. The Skipper gives Gilligan a bear hug from behind. SKIPPER You mean like this? The Skipper squeezes Gilligan who lets out a hurricane like sound of wind. The Skipper lets go and Gilligan falls to the ground. Gilligan looks winded. SKIPPER (cont'd) Are you all right, little buddy? Did I hurt you? GILLIGAN Next time let's just shake hands. FLIP TO: EXT. BALLOON CLEARING - DAY RAINCOAT BALLOON WITH INFLATED ARMS SKIPPER I still say I'm the one who goes in the balloon. PROFESSOR And I thought we agreed to use logic. SKIPPER But that is logic. It's logical for the captain to go. MR HOWELL Well, I'm the richest man here and I have something to say. Believe me. The Skipper, Professor, Mr. Howell and Gilligan stand in the balloon's basket. PROFESSOR What kind of logic is that? MR HOWELL Well, it's the best kind of logic, money. SKIPPER Gentlemen, we got to reach a decision. GILLIGAN Now, here we go again. It's a cinch you three can't go up there. SKIPPER Well, I know navigation. PROFESSOR I know air currents. MR HOWELL Well, I know the presidents of five major airlines. GILLIGAN I know I'm not going up in this thing. MR HOWELL What do you mean, it'll be perfectly comfortable, with Ginger as the stewardess, the Skipper here as the pilot, and the Professor as navigator. I'll be more than comfortable. SKIPPER Mister Howell, I do wish you'd listen. Only one person can go in this balloon. MR HOWELL One person? No bubbly? No movies? Oh, my God, that's a tourist flight. SKIPPER Exactly. MR HOWELL Well, exactly, then count me out. PROFESSOR All right, Skipper, then it's between you and me. GILLIGAN Why not draw straws? SKIPPER Oh, of all the stupid ideas. PROFESSOR Why is it stupid? SKIPPER (to Gilligan) Well, why did you say it was stupid, Gilligan? GILLIGAN But, Skipper! SKIPPER Well, I'll hold the straws. PROFESSOR Oh, no. No, no. No, you won't. MR HOWELL No, no, no. I just happen to have two straws. See? The short one goes. Good enough? Good enough? Mr. Howell holds up the straws for the Skipper and Professor to take. MR HOWELL (cont'd) There you are. SKIPPER Ready? PROFESSOR Ready. Both draw a straw and compare. SKIPPER I won! I won! I won! I won! (pause) I think. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BALLOON CLEARING - DAY The Skipper stands in the balloon's basket. MR HOWELL Remember to call by broker, all right? SKIPPER The minute I land, Mister Howell GINGER And you'll call my agent? SKIPPER Oh, I've got his number right in my pocket. GILLIGAN Don't forget to send somebody back. SKIPPER Gilligan, that's why I'm going, remember? GILLIGAN Sure, I remember. I just hope you don't forget. PROFESSOR All right, everybody listen. MR HOWELL Roger. That's air force talk. Wild blue yonder. MRS HOWELL Oh, roger. PROFESSOR Now, I'll control the main guideline. That'll get the balloon clear of the foliage and make sure he's headed in the right direction. MR HOWELL If you land in London, mention my name to the royal family, they'll put you up. PROFESSOR Gilligan, you and Mister Howell steady the sidelines. JUNGLE BOY wears Mr. Howell's brimmed hat, jacket and ascot, and watches the raincoat balloon launch. PROFESSOR (O.S.) And be ready to let go when I yell. MR HOWELL (O.S.) Roger. BACK TO SCENE PROFESSOR Gilligan, cast off that sideline. The Skipper stands in the basket, arms folded and confident. PROFESSOR (cont'd) I'll start the countdown. Five, four, three, two, one! Gilligan gives the tie down rope a yank. The Professor pulls on his release cord, and stares up at the balloon. The Skipper has look of surprise on his face. SKIPPER I guess it's still too heavy, Professor. I'll throw off a little ballast. The Skipper throws out a few gourds used as ballast and the balloon and basket moves upwards. The castaways look up at the balloon as it moves skyward and yell out their farewells. PROFESSOR Good luck, Skipper. MR HOWELL (French) Bon voyage! RAINCOAT BALLOON WITH INFLATED ARMS PAN DOWN BALLOON'S SIDE TO Skipper who is not moving upward while the raincoat balloon does. The bottom of the basket broke under the Skippers weight and the Skipper desperately hangs on to the basket to keep the balloon from floating off. SKIPPER Pull the balloon back down. Everyone but the Howells grab for the balloon and hold it down. MR HOWELL We haven't six claws, I mean, really Lovey. I can't stand an ... JUNGLE BOY just watches with amusement. BACK TO SCENE MR HOWELL (cont'd) ... unsuccessful attempt. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - NIGHT The castaways are gathered near the hut as the Professor continues the discussion about the launch failure. PROFESSOR Our first experiment was perfect. Except, of course, for one minor detail. MR HOWELL It failed. PROFESSOR I know. But that's just because the cargo was overweight. Gilligan and the Jungle boy shoot spit wads at each other as the discussion continues. GILLIGAN That's you, Skipper. SKIPPER Be quiet, Gilligan. The Professor's trying to explain something to us. MARY ANN Go ahead, Professor. PROFESSOR So the weight problem eliminated, everything else is worked out scientifically. Now, I've computed the cross Pacific air currents, the rotation of the Earth, our latitude and longitude, and the jet stream which goes directly to Hawaii. GILLIGAN He wore out two whole pencils. PROFESSOR Now, the balloon only has to rise to a height of three hundred... Gilligan shoots another spit wad. PROFESSOR (O.S.) ... feet to catch the prevailing air currents, which means it can twenty pounds of provisions, or ninety pounds of human cargo with complete safety. MR HOWELL Ninety pounds? JUNGLE BOY shoots a spitwad back at Gilligan. BACK TO SCENE MARY ANN Oh, no, you don't. MR HOWELL We'll give the lad flight pay. PROFESSOR Oh, I assure you he'll be completely safe. And we can put a note in his pocket explaining our situation. GILLIGAN You know, the Professor's got a point. GINGER Well, you can't send that boy up in a crate. GILLIGAN She's got a good point, too. SKIPPER But it'll sail itself. There's no navigation problem. GILLIGAN You got a good point, too. The Jungle boy is shot by Gilligan again. MRS HOWELL Well, aren't you suppose to test these things or something? GILLIGAN Missus Howell's got a good point. MR HOWELL But the flight will make the lad famous. GILLIGAN Mister Howell has a good point, too. SKIPPER Gilligan, not everyone can have a good point. You don't have to agree with everyone. GILLIGAN You know something, Skipper? You got a good point, too. Gilligan tries to shoot the Jungle boy but ends up shooting right into the Skipper's ear. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Besides, I don't see why anybody should go up in that balloon. All you have to do is put a rescue note in it, and let it go up by itself. There's a long pause while everyone realizes Gilligan is right and all start giving him praise ad lib. PROFESSOR Gilligan, that's a marvelous idea. The Castaways tell Gilligan that his idea is good. JUNGLE BOY PROFESSOR (O.S.) Absolutely wonderful. The Jungle boy looks at the balloon with special interest. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BALLOON CLEARING - MORNING Jungle boy stands in the raincoat balloon's BASKET. He cuts the tethers with a KNIFE. After he cuts the last line, the balloon lifts off on its journey. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SKY - DAY RAINCOAT BALLOON IN FLIGHT The balloon balloon floats in the air on its way to Hawaii. FLIP TO: EXT. HUT - DAY The Skipper and Professor emerge from the hut. The Professor is carrying a piece of paper. PROFESSOR I put everything I could think of into this rescue note. SKIPPER So did I, as much as we know about longitude and latitude. MRS HOWELL And I offered a generous reward for our rescue. MR HOWELL I knew you would, Lovey. My note merely reads, "Double previous offer." Gilligan runs up to the men. GILLIGAN Skipper! Professor! The boy's gone. He's disappeared. SKIPPER Well, maybe he went back to where he use to live to get a few things! MR HOWELL What would he have, a formal loincloth? PROFESSOR I wonder. MRS HOWELL You wonder what? PROFESSOR Well, he knew we were talking about him. And he knew we were talking about the balloon. MRS HOWELL Oh, no, he wouldn't do that. SKIPPER Ooohhh! They all exit. EXT. BALLOON CLEARING - DAY The Skipper, Gilligan, Professor and Mr. and Mrs. Howell run up to find the balloon gone. SKIPPER The balloon is gone, it's gone. MR HOWELL Is it caught in the trees anywhere? MRS HOWELL It's terrible. The Skipper and Gilligan bend over and pick up the cut hold down lines. GILLIGAN Oh, he sure must have used a sharp knife! SKIPPER Why these are cut clean through! MRS HOWELL Oh, that poor boy! PROFESSOR I assure you, Missus Howell, he'll be perfectly safe. GILLIGAN (excitedly) Not only that, we'll all be rescued. Because when they find him, he'll tell them about us, and he'll tell them about the island, and he'll tell them to send a boat, and he'll tell them... SKIPPER Gilligan, and just how is going to tell them? GILLIGAN He'll just say, "Boy, boy, girl, girl, no, no." The realization that the boy won't be able to say anything sinks in and Gilligan looks defeated. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: INT. SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN'S HUT - DAY Gilligan is seated at a table listening to MUSIC on the radio, as the Skipper stands looking out the hut's door. He turns around to address Gilligan. SKIPPER Gilligan, I keep telling you it was not your fault. GILLIGAN Yeah, but I found him. SKIPPER Well, we'd have found him eventually. GILLIGAN How about the helium? SKIPPER Gilligan, if there is any blame, we should all share it. Now, we knew he was listening when we were talking about the whole thing. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our regularly scheduled program for a special announcement. Gilligan looks as if he's about to say something as the Skipper leans closer on the table. SKIPPER Shhh! GILLIGAN I didn't say anything. SKIPPER Well, you were just about to, now shhhh! RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) A most miraculous and unusual event has happened. An unidentified boy in a balloon made of raincoats, has landed on the deck of a United States aircraft carrier. GILLIGAN He made it! Oh, he made it! Hey, everybody! SKIPPER He made it! He made it! Everybody! The Skipper and Gilligan run to the door and window, running into each other in the process and yelling for the other castaways. The other castaways come running. Mrs. Howell, Ginger and Mary Ann take up positions outside the window while Mr. Howell and the Professor enter the hut. Mr. Howell takes up position near the table. MR HOWELL What is that? What is that? SKIPPER Listen. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Of course, the mystery will remain with us for years, for it will take that long to find out who he is or where he came from since all he can do is mimic. MRS HOWELL He could use a fork. GINGER Well, he can comb his hair. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Obviously he didn't make the balloon himself. MR HOWELL The boy's a pilot, not an inventor! RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) He had help, but whom? SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR PROFESSOR Who. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) So far, all we been able to get out of him is, "boy, boy, girl, girl, no, no." SKIPPER That's about all they'll ever get out of him too. Gilligan turn off the radio. GILLIGAN But after he grows up and goes to high school and college, he'll be able to talk real good. GINGER But that'll be ten years. SKIPPER Anything else, Gilligan? GILLIGAN You Skipper, him Professor, me nut. Gilligan has an embarrassed look on his face. FADE OUT. THE END 
pisode #16, “Plant You Now, Dig You Later” Both Gilligan and Mr. Howell lay claim to a treasure chest that Gilligan dug up while working for Mr. Howell. The Professor offers to settle ownership with a trial.  “Plant You Now, Dig You Later”  By  Elroy Schwartz  and  Oliver Crawford  January 16, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY PAN from waterfall to barbecue pit as Gilligan digs a barbecue pit. EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan places his bamboo shovel on the sand, feels a hard object, and puts his foot against the shovel. It breaks. Gilligan squats down and examines the bowl of the shovel. SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan? Gilligan, where are you? Gilligan hides the bowl of the shovel in a nearby pile of soil. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY Skipper emerges from the jungle. SKIPPER Gilligan? Gilligan? EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Skipper approaches Gilligan. Gilligan stands. SKIPPER Gilligan, what are you doing down here? You're supposed to be cutting bamboo poles. GILLIGAN I'm digging a barbecue pit for Mister Howell. Goodbye, Skipper. SKIPPER "Goodbye, Skipper"? GILLIGAN Yeah, I got to dig this pit. So long. (pause) See you later. SKIPPER Well, dig. SKIPPER (cont'd) Oh, Gilligan, let me show you how to dig a barbecue pit. Skipper takes the shovel handle from Gilligan. He lifts the shovel and discovers that the bowl is gone. GILLIGAN Oh! You broke the shovel, Skipper. Skipper holds up the handle. SKIPPER Where is the rest of this shovel? Gilligan uses his foot to uncover the bowl of the shovel in the pile of soil. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, that's the fifth shovel you've broken this week. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, but I hit something real hard. SKIPPER The only thing hard on this island is your head. Skipper drives the handle into the soil. SKIPPER (cont'd) It's soft sand. Skipper realizes there is something hard down there. GILLIGAN See, I told you. Must be a rock or something. Skipper taps the handle around in various places. SKIPPER Doesn't feel like a rock, it feels square. GILLIGAN A big square rock? Skipper continues to tap, but grows excited. Skipper bends down and digs the soil away. SKIPPER Gilligan, give me the rest of that shovel. I think you've uncovered -- look at the chains! Skipper tosses the shovel bowl away and uses his hands to dig. GILLIGAN Huh? SKIPPER Dig! Gilligan digs with this hands. Chains are visible. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, I think you've uncovered a treasure chest. The men continue to dig out the treasure chest. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan and Skipper move the treasure chest from the lagoon beach to camp. Skipper pushes the chest from behind. Gilligan lays down large bamboo rollers in the path of the chest. GILLIGAN Careful, now. You've got to make a turn here. SKIPPER Yes, Gilligan, I see that we have to make a turn. GILLIGAN Here, give me that one there. SKIPPER Another roller down. That's right, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Come on, push. SKIPPER If we work as a team, it'll see us through. GILLIGAN Skipper, you're not pushing hard enough. Come on. SKIPPER I'm pushing hard. GILLIGAN Come on, Skipper, push, push, push. Skipper stands up. SKIPPER Gilligan, I thought we could do this together. But since you're going to stand there and criticize, I'll do it myself. Skipper picks up the treasure chest, moves it to a clear spot, and puts it down. Gilligan is startled that Skipper is strong enough to lift the chest. Skipper and Gilligan kneel next to it. SKIPPER (cont'd) Oh, never mind that. Look at this chest, Gilligan. It must be hand-forged, even the lock and the chain. GILLIGAN Forged? You mean it's an imitation? SKIPPER Gilligan, this is the real thing. There must be a fortune in this chest. Come on, let's try to get this padlock and chain off. Hand me that piece of bamboo. Gilligan picks up a small bamboo pole and gives it to Skipper. GILLIGAN Here. Boy, I can hardly wait to see what's inside that treasure chest. Ginger and Mary Ann appear from the jungle. GINGER Treasure chest? What's in it? MARY ANN Oh, is it real? GINGER Who found it? MARY ANN Why don't you open it? GINGER Who buried it? MARY ANN Can we help? GILLIGAN Ginger, we don't know, I did and maybe pirates. Mary Ann, I did, we're trying, and no, thanks. GINGER This is the most exciting thing that's happened to us. MARY ANN You read about buried treasure, but never expect to find any. GILLIGAN Let's get some leverage on it. Gilligan places the bamboo pole under the chains. GILLIGAN (cont'd) One, two, three, go! Skipper YELLS in pain as his fingers are caught between the pole and the chain. Gilligan releases the pole. Skipper removes his finger. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Sorry, Skipper. SKIPPER My finger. (pause) Please, everybody stand back now. I don't want anybody to be hurt when this chain snaps. Skipper puts his foot on the chest for leverage, grips the pole, and pulls up on it. He adjusts himself and moves his hands to the end of the pole and pulls up again. The end of the pole breaks off. Skipper recoils backward into the jungle. He lands face-first. He rolls onto one arm and gives an aside glance. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - LATER The treasure chest rests intact. Debris of bamboo poles lie all around. PAN TO Skipper and Gilligan sitting nearby. SKIPPER You'd think the rust would've weakened that chain after all this time. GILLIGAN Hope we can saw that chain with the piece of coral. SKIPPER We'll find out when the girls get back. Mr. and Mrs. Howell enter. Mr. Howell carries a stick. MR HOWELL Well, now, what have we here? Gilligan and Skipper rise. GILLIGAN Oh, hi, Mister Howell. It's a treasure chest that I found while digging the pit. MR HOWELL Look at that, Lovey. That's how millionaires used to keep their money. MRS HOWELL How quaint. It doesn't look like it could hold very much. MR HOWELL Our piggy banks are bigger than that. Mr. Howell points his stick at the treasure chest. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Have you tried to open it? Gilligan and Skipper look at each other. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT A torch burns. Skipper uses a piece of coral as an abrasive to cut through the chains on the treasure chest. Gilligan races up, passes the Howells, Ginger, and Mary Ann, who watch Skipper from the sidelines. Gilligan carries a piece of a fish that looks like a wood saw. GILLIGAN Skipper, maybe this will work. I got it off the fish we had last night. Here, hold the chain. Ready? Watch it. Cut it right -- Gilligan draws the saw back. All of its teeth on the lower side are removed by the strong chain. SKIPPER Gilligan, I could have told you that wouldn't work. You've got to use your head. That's why I've been using the coral. GILLIGAN Oh, does that work? SKIPPER No. MARY ANN I wish the Professor were here. He could tell us how to open that thing. GILLIGAN He's on the other side searching in caves. He won't be back until tomorrow. MR HOWELL Well, that chest has been closed for hundreds of years and I don't think one day won't make any difference. I suggest we get a good night's sleep and try first thing in the morning. The Howells, Mary Ann, and Ginger get up. FLIP TO: INT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Mary Ann sits at a small table and holds a hand mirror while Ginger puts rollers in her hair. MARY ANN Thanks for putting up my hair, Ginger. Mary Ann places the mirror down on the table. Ginger rolls some of Mary Ann's hair onto a roller. GINGER Oh, I couldn't sleep anyway, thinking about that treasure chest. Ginger works on Mary Ann's hair. Ginger wets a bobby pin in her mouth and places it on the roller. MARY ANN I hope it's filled with diamonds or gold, or even silver. What would you like to find in it? GINGER Rock Hudson. FLIP TO: INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Gilligan rests on his hammock with his hat over his eyes and his arms folded under his head. Skipper lies on the hammock below. SKIPPER Gilligan? Gilligan pulls his hat from over his eyes. GILLIGAN Yeah? Skipper shushes Gilligan. SKIPPER Are you asleep? GILLIGAN If I am, I am doing it with my eyes wide open. I'm too excited to sleep. SKIPPER You have every right to be excited. Just think, little buddy, by this time tomorrow you might be a millionaire. What are you going to do with the all that money? GILLIGAN First thing I'm gonna do is buy something that'll open up that chest. You really think I'm a millionaire? SKIPPER Sure, it's your chest. You found it, didn't you? GILLIGAN Oh, yeah. SKIPPER Well, finders keepers. GILLIGAN What do you think is in there? SKIPPER Silver and gold doubloons, maybe even gold bullion. GILLIGAN Soup? SKIPPER No, Gilligan, not soup. Skipper rolls out of the lower hammock and stands up. SKIPPER (cont'd) But whatever it's got, it's got a lot of it. I just wonder what's in there. I can hardly stand the suspense. Skipper walks over to a spot where his feet are illuminated by the moonlight. MATCH FLIP TO: INT. HOWELL HUT - NIGHT Mr. Howell stands in his bath robe. Mrs. Howell gathers up netting. MRS HOWELL Come to bed, Thurston, it's getting late. MR HOWELL I -- I can't sleep. I keep wondering what wonderful, marvelous trinkets must be in that treasure chest. MRS HOWELL You know, Thurston, in all the years we've been married, I never saw you pace the floor before. Mrs. Howell puts the netting over her head. MR HOWELL Well, of course not. At home, I had my butler do it for me. These islands can be so inconvenient. Mr. Howell helps Mrs. Howell put the netting over her head. MRS HOWELL Are you positive that treasure chest belongs to you? MR HOWELL Well, of course, Gilligan was working for me at the time when he was digging and found it. He was in my employ. All big business operates that way. I just wish we could open that chest. MRS HOWELL But how? The Captain and Gilligan did everything they could. They tried everything but picking the lock. Mr. Howell removes the netting from Mrs. Howell. MR HOWELL Picking the lock! Lovey, just like on the Late, Late, Late Show. Why don't we try that? Mrs. Howell drops the netting. MRS HOWELL I'll get my knitting needle. INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Gilligan lies in his top hammock. Skipper races over to him. SKIPPER Gilligan, I just thought of something. We didn't think about picking the lock. GILLIGAN Yeah. Gilligan rolls out of his hammock and runs into Skipper. INT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Ginger continues to work on Mary Ann's hair. Mary Ann has curlers in her hair. Ginger looks at a bobby pin in her hand. GINGER A bobby pin. Hey. Hey, you know, I was once in a movie where I picked a lock with a bobby pin. MARY ANN Oh, Ginger. Mary Ann gets up and they exit. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT The treasure chest sits intact. Around it lies the debris of the previous attempts to open it. Bits of bamboo poles, the sawtooth blade from the fish, and the coral are strewn around. Mr and Mrs. Howell approach the chest. Mrs. Howell snags her nightgown on a plant. MRS HOWELL Oh, dear. MR HOWELL Quiet, Lovey. MRS HOWELL Thurston, this is fun. I feel positively criminal. SWISH PAN TO: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT Skipper and Gilligan approach the treasure chest. GILLIGAN Skipper, Skipper, I can hardly wait to find out if I'm a gold millionaire or a jewelry millionaire. Skipper shushes him. SWISH PAN TO: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT CLOSEUP - GINGER AND MARY ANN as they quietly approach the jungle clearing with the treasure chest. Ginger turns, sees the other castaways, and is surprised to find them there too. GINGER Oh! PULL BACK to reveal the Howells, Skipper, and Gilligan emerge from the jungle into the clearing with the treasure chest. MR HOWELL Well, uh, good evening. GINGER Lovely evening, yes, it is. SKIPPER It is a beautiful evening. We were just out for a breath of fresh air. GILLIGAN Oh, no, Skipper, don't you remember? We came here to get the chest -- Skipper puts his hand over Gilligan's mouth. SKIPPER Gilligan, you know that -- night air is bad for my little buddy. MR HOWELL Shall we turn in -- for the night? MARY ANN See you all in the morning. MRS HOWELL Good night. They all turn to return to their huts. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. JUNGLE - DAY HIGH ANGLE as Skipper pulls on the vine wound over a pulley, the treasure chest rises into the air. GILLIGAN Attaboy, Skipper, I knew you'd figure out a way to get it open. SKIPPER Certainly, Gilligan. We'll let the weight of the chest itself break it wide open. Make it fast. Gilligan ties Skipper's end of the vine to a nearby palm tree. MR HOWELL Well, I still don't see how you're going to open the chest this way. SKIPPER Very simple, Mr. Howell. All we have to do is cut the vine. The chest falls and its own weight will break those seams wide open when it hits the ground. MR HOWELL Well, I must say that's very clever. I must reward you with part of my treasure chest. LOW ANGLE SKIPPER Your treasure chest? That treasure is Gilligan's. MR HOWELL Gilligan's? SKIPPER Of course, he found it. Didn't you? GILLIGAN You were with me. Don't you remember? SKIPPER Of course I remember. MR HOWELL But he was working for me. Therefore the treasure is mine. SKIPPER Finders keepers. MR HOWELL But that's ridiculous. It is the practice of any large corporation. SKIPPER Gilligan is not a corporation. GILLIGAN I'm not even a business. MR HOWELL I still say the treasure chest is mine. Skipper folds his arms across his chest. SKIPPER That treasure chest is Gilligan's. Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell fold their arms across their chests. MR HOWELL It's mine. SKIPPER Gilligan's. MR HOWELL Mine. SKIPPER Gilligan? Gilligan folds his arms across his chest. GILLIGAN Mine! FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan pokes at the suspended treasure chest with a bamboo pole. The treasure chest spins. A NOISE startles Gilligan. SKIPPER It's only me, little buddy. GILLIGAN I thought it might have been Mister Howell. SKIPPER I came back to help you protect your rights. You know, when Howell wants something, he can be pretty tricky. Mr. and Mrs. Howell return. Mrs. Howell carries a parasol. MR HOWELL Oh, there you are. I thought I might find you next to my treasure chest. Skipper folds his arms across his chest. SKIPPER Gilligan's treasure. MR HOWELL Gentlemen, I'm sure there's some simple and fair solution. SKIPPER And what did you have in mind? MR HOWELL Nothing specific. Perhaps tossing a coin, drawing straws, perhaps. MRS HOWELL Oh, what about a game of cards? Gentlemen often settle their differences with a game of cards. MR HOWELL Now, Lovey, you know that I know nothing about cards. SKIPPER Little buddy -- MR. AND MRS. HOWELL as they mask their conversation with Mrs. Howell's parasol. MRS HOWELL (sotto) Did I do it right, darling? MR HOWELL (sotto) You did absolutely perfect. Little do they know that I'm a champion poker player known as "slipper fingers." MRS HOWELL (sotto) I know. GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER discuss strategy. SKIPPER (sotto) He doesn't know it, but he fell right into our trap. I was the best poker player in the whole of the Seventh Fleet. Now we got to make sure that he plays poker. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER (cont'd) Well, I think we can be coaxed into a little game of cards. GILLIGAN Now wait a minute, where are you going to get the cards? MR HOWELL Oh, uh, oh, cards. Yes, yes, by a happy coincidence, I happen to have a deck of cards right here. SKIPPER Fine. One game, winner take all? MR HOWELL Yes, agreed. SKIPPER Should we play gin rummy? MR HOWELL Blackjack. SKIPPER Casino. MR HOWELL Baccarat. SKIPPER Red dog. MR HOWELL Whist. SKIPPER Well, anything but poker, that's my worst game. MR HOWELL Mine, too, but we'll play. SKIPPER Agreed. Skipper offers his hand to shake. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Mr. Howell fans the deck of cards in his hand. Mr. Howell cuts and shuffles the deck. He places the deck on the table. MR HOWELL You gentlemen will have to excuse me for not knowing too much about cards. SKIPPER I'll cut. Skipper puts his hand on the deck to cut. MR HOWELL Not yet. Mr. Howell slaps his hand. Mr. Howell takes the cards and spreads the cards onto the table. He flips the cards over from one end to the other. Mr. Howell shows several shuffling tricks. MR HOWELL (cont'd) See, back home I pay attention to more important things. Such as polo playing, fox hunting. But then, of course, from time to time, I did watch the boys play. Gilligan is amazed at Mr. Howell's camera handiwork, but Skipper reassures him with a firm hand on Gilligan's shoulder. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Now, uh, how many do I deal? SKIPPER Why, six, I think. Skipper and Gilligan look at each other. Gilligan looks at Mr. Howell. GILLIGAN Five, isn't it? MR HOWELL By George, he's right. I think you deal five. SKIPPER All right, whatever you say. MR HOWELL Yes, all right. Now you may cut. Mr. Howell places the deck of cards in front of Skipper. Skipper performs an equally impressive series of actions. He reveals the top card, an Ace of Spades. He shuffles moves and reveals the top card again, an Ace of Spades. Skipper shuffles more and finally cuts the deck with one hand. He places the deck back down on the table. SKIPPER Now you may deal. MR HOWELL Ready? Mr. Howell turns over the top card, the Ace of Spades and places it face up on the top of the deck. Mr. Howell proceeds to deal seconds from the deck. Professor enters. PROFESSOR Hey, the girls told me the fantastic news. So, that's the treasure chest, huh? TREASURE CHEST suspended from the vine. GILLIGAN (O.S.) That's right, Professor. PROFESSOR (O.S.) Well, it certainly looks like the real thing. BACK TO SCENE PROFESSOR But I understand there's a question as to the ownership. GILLIGAN Yeah, that's why we're playing one game of poker, winner take all. PROFESSOR Back home you would never play cards for anything so important. MR HOWELL Yes, but back home there are laws about such things. This fellow was in my employ. SKIPPER Yeah, well, the law says finders keepers. PROFESSOR Well, If you're interested in law, there's one way to settle this legally: a court trial. MR HOWELL A court trial, here on this island? PROFESSOR Why not? As the law says: (in Latin) Lex loci, lex scriptae, lex terrae. Nemo solus sapit. GILLIGAN What does that mean? Professor smiles. PROFESSOR Your case comes up Tuesday. Professor pats Mr. Howell on the shoulder. Skipper looks at Gilligan. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Professor discusses the legal proceeding with Mr. Howell, Gilligan, and Skipper. Gilligan and Skipper sit at the table. TREASURE CHEST suspended by the vine. PROFESSOR (O.S.) And you both have agreed ... BACK TO SCENE PROFESSOR ... to a trial to establish the ownership of the treasure chest? Right, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL Of course, I have a legal right to it. PROFESSOR Gilligan? Gilligan rises from his seat. GILLIGAN Skipper says I shouldn't talk to anyone until I talk to my attorney. PROFESSOR Well, who's your attorney? GILLIGAN Skipper. MR HOWELL Professor, I'll pay you a thousand dollars to represent me. GILLIGAN But he's gonna be the judge. MR HOWELL In that case, I'll double the offer. Skipper holds a blanket between Mr. Howell and Professor. SKIPPER Uh-uh-ah, public official, Mister Howell. Mr. Howell turns in disgust. Professor laughs. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELL HUT - DAY Mr. Howell practices his cross-examination techniques with Mrs. Howell. Mrs. Howell sits at their practice witness stand. MR HOWELL No more of your evasive replies, just answer "yes" or "no." Did I or did I not hire you to dig the barbecue pit which resulted in your finding the treasure chest? MRS HOWELL Thurston, that's very good. You're bound to win. Mr. Howell sits down next to Mrs. Howell. MR HOWELL Well, confidentially not, Lovey. You see, this isn't an open and shut case. While I did hire Gilligan, I didn't actually pay him and the Skipper might use that as a loophole. MRS HOWELL "Loophole." You know all the legal terms. MR HOWELL Why not? After all, I watched Perry Mason for six years. But I can close that loophole if, if -- MRS HOWELL If what, dear? Mr. Howell reaches under a pillow and pulls out a pile of cash and fans it to show how much is there. MR HOWELL If I can get Gilligan to take the money now. Mr. Howell laughs and stands. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan stands high up on a ladder and picks coconuts from a tree. Mr. Howell walks closer. MR HOWELL Oh, there you are, Gilligan. I -- I've been looking all over for you. GILLIGAN Oh, you have? I've been right up here. MR HOWELL Yes, well, I -- I want to pay you for the -- the work that you did for me. Gilligan climbs down the ladder. GILLIGAN But Mister Howell, I never finished digging the barbecue pit. I only dug for ten minutes. MR HOWELL At least let me pay you for the time that you dug. Will a hundred dollars be enough? Mr. Howell holds out a $100 bill. GILLIGAN A hundred dollars? That's almost five hundred dollars an hour. MR HOWELL Six hundred, but who's counting? Gilligan reaches for the bill. Skipper appears from the bushes. SKIPPER Gilligan, don't take that money. Gilligan and Mr. Howell are startled. GILLIGAN Why not, Skipper? SKIPPER Gilligan, he's hoping that you'll take the money because it'll strengthen his claim on the treasure chest. (to Howell) From now on, you are not to talk to my client. MR HOWELL All right, I'll see you in court. Mr. Howell holds up the bill to Gilligan. Gilligan walks toward it, but Mr. Howell spins around and exits. Skipper blocks Gilligan from following Mr. Howell. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan heats rocks in a pan over the campfire. He touches the pan to see that it is hot. He picks it up using a removable handle and carries it inside the hut. INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Gilligan places the pan down on another group of rocks. Gilligan smooths his shirt out on the ironing board. He uses the pan of hot rocks to iron his shirt. Gilligan places one hand under the collar of his shirt. He runs the pan over his hand and exclaims that it is hot, but the removable handle comes free. Gilligan struggles to reattach the handle. He moves the pan off of his hand and then removes his hand from the collar of his shirt. Gilligan brings his hand to his face and kisses it. Gilligan places his burned hand to his shoulder and continues ironing. Ginger enters and swings the door shut behind her. GINGER (sultry) Hi, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Oh, hi Ginger. I'm just ironing my shirt. My lawyer said I got to look the best for the trial. GINGER (sultry) You're cute. Ginger touches Gilligan's burned hand. GILLIGAN Ow. Skipper's not here. Gilligan climbs under his ironing board and emerges from the other side. GINGER (sultry) I didn't come to see him. GILLIGAN Well, the Professor's not here, either. GINGER (sultry) I came to see you. Ginger crawls under the ironing board. GILLIGAN Yeah? Gilligan puts on his rugby shirt. Ginger emerges on Gilligan's side of the ironing board. Ginger slowly approaches Gilligan, backing him to the hut's wall. GINGER (sultry) Ever since I've been on this island, I've been forcing myself to stay away from you, Gilligan. Just to fool the Skipper and the Professor. GILLIGAN You fooled me pretty good, too. GINGER (sultry) Look at me, Gilligan. Can't you tell what I've got bottled up inside of me? GILLIGAN No, but it sure is trying to get out. Ginger grasps Gilligan's shoulders and brings him close. GINGER (sultry) Let me tell you how -- (recoils) Oh, you're hot. Gilligan pushes his arm through the hut wall. GILLIGAN Just my buttons. GINGER Would you do me a favor? EXT. BOYS HUT - CONTINUOUS Skipper picks up coconuts. Skipper notices Gilligan's arm, poked through the hut wall, thrashing around. GINGER (O.S.) Forget about that old chest. I mean, just admit that you were working for Mister Howell. Skipper tosses the coconuts to the ground as he moves to the window. INT. BOYS HUT - CONTINUOUS Ginger approaches Gilligan again. GINGER (sultry) Okay? GILLIGAN Yeah, and -- SKIPPER pokes his head through the window and lifts the curtain. SKIPPER And ... RETURN TO SCENE Ginger turns to the window. SKIPPER admonishes Ginger. SKIPPER (cont'd) ... you can stay away from Gilligan. Ginger, you can go back to Mister Howell and tell him that it didn't work. Ginger purses her face at Gilligan. FLIP TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper and Gilligan prepare for trial. Skipper paces in the hut, instructing Gilligan about the trial. Gilligan sits and listens. SKIPPER That's right, Gilligan. It's not only important to tell the truth but it's also important how you tell it. Now, let's get the story straight, right from the beginning. GILLIGAN Okay, let's see. You told me to go cut some bamboo for a fish trap and Mister Howell said he had a job -- SKIPPER Hold it. Did he say "job"? GILLIGAN No. SKIPPER Then don't mention it. Now, remember the five points we went over. If you get stuck at the trial, just look over to me and I'll give you an answer by holding up a finger. Now let's try it. SKIPPER points to his thumb. SKIPPER (cont'd) Mister Howell wanted you to do something for him. Skipper points to his index finger. SKIPPER (cont'd) He showed you where he wanted the barbecue pit. GILLIGAN listens intently. SKIPPER (O.S.) He never mentioned the word "job," never talked about "money" ... SKIPPER points to his pinky finger. SKIPPER ... and never paid you a penny. Now, you got that? GILLIGAN smiles. GILLIGAN Yeah. SKIPPER holds out his thumb. SKIPPER What's that? GILLIGAN answers literally. GILLIGAN Your thumb. SKIPPER SKIPPER No, that's Mister Howell asking you to do something for him. GILLIGAN GILLIGAN Oh, I see. That's pretty good, Skipper. SKIPPER extends his pinky finger. SKIPPER What's that? GILLIGAN GILLIGAN Mr. Howell never paid me a single pinkie. Penny. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER Right, Gilligan, remember that! EXT. BOYS HUT - CONTINUOUS Mr. Howell passes by the boys hut and hears them coaching Gilligan for the trial. GILLIGAN (O.S.) Don't worry, I'll remember. SKIPPER (O.S.) You'll remember everything, even if we have to sit up all night. MR HOWELL Tampering with a witness. I'll file charges. Mr. Howell exits. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Professor sits at a table with pencil and paper. Mr. Howell stands and recounts the witness tampering. PROFESSOR Now, Mister Howell, take it easy. Tell me again, what were his exact words? MR HOWELL Well, Gilligan said that he'd get it straight, you see. And the Skipper said he'd make sure he did if it took all night. So, I want to prefer charges in court. PROFESSOR But Mister Howell, Counsel has the right to go over testimony with his client. MR HOWELL Wait a minute, whose side are you on? PROFESSOR Why, I'm not on anybody's side. Professor puts the paper he's holding onto the stack of paper. Professor writes on the paper. MR HOWELL You're not? We'll take care of that. Mr. Howell removes cash from his pocket. EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS Skipper and Gilligan walk through the jungle and notice the discussion between Professor and Mr. Howell. SKIPPER We'll start all over again. Hey, I wonder what's going on over there. They walk briskly. EXT. CAMP - CONTINUOUS Professor stands. Mr. Howell holds a handful of cash. PROFESSOR I hope you're not thinking of offering me a bribe. MR HOWELL Why, of course not. I -- but I -- Do you recall two weeks ago at dinner when I asked someone to pass me the papaya juice, and you did? Well, I want to pay you for that service. Will five thousand dollars be -- PROFESSOR No, no, no. Skipper and Gilligan rush in. SKIPPER A-ha. I caught you red-handed, Howell, trying to bribe a public official. Your Honor, I want to file charges. Professor walks away from all of them. PROFESSOR First trial hasn't even started, and I've already got two more cases on the docket. Professor exits. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY An American flag hangs in the background. Mary Ann prepares the judges bench. Ginger straightens papers on the bench. SKIPPER (to Professor) Are you ready? Skipper pounds his palm on the bench. SKIPPER (cont'd) Everyone take their places. The first Superior Court of this island ... TREASURE CHEST hangs from the vine. SKIPPER (O.S.) ... is now in session. PROFESSOR sits down on the bench. SKIPPER (O.S.) (cont'd) The Honorable Professor presiding. PROFESSOR Be seated. BACK TO SCENE The castaways sit. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Since everyone is familiar with the case we will dispense the reading of the complaint and counter-charges. Skipper, you may call your first witness. MR HOWELL I object. PROFESSOR To what? MR HOWELL I want to call my witnesses first. PROFESSOR But, Mister Howell, I -- MR HOWELL If you don't let me, I'm gonna take back my cape. SKIPPER Professor, that is, Your Honor, it's perfectly all right with me if Mister Howell calls his witnesses first. PROFESSOR All right, Mister Howell, you may call your first witness. MR HOWELL Thank you, Your Honor. I call as my first witness a Missus Thurston Howell the Third to the -- oh, there you go. PROFESSOR Missus Howell, you may take the stand. Mr. Howell helps Mrs. Howell up onto the stand. She sits, but nearly loses her balance. MR HOWELL Now, Missus Thurston Howell the Third will you tell the court the events that took place the morning of the fifth? MRS HOWELL Oh, Thurston, that was beautiful. You really ought to be on "The Defenders." But you forgot to point your finger at me. SKIPPER Your Honor, I object! Skipper stands. PROFESSOR What are you objecting to? SKIPPER Your Honor, I feel that they've rehearsed her testimony. MR HOWELL No more than he's rehearsed Gilligan's. SKIPPER And you brought me before this court on charges, well, I want to file charges, Your Honor. PROFESSOR All right, but you'll have to wait your turn. That would be case number four. Now please, let us get on with the testimony. Professor bangs his coconut gavel onto the bench. MR HOWELL Your Honor, would you mind getting another gavel? PROFESSOR Why? MR HOWELL Well, that one's squirting milk all over. Mr. Howell turns to reveal his face splashed with coconut milk. He wipes his face with a handkerchief. PROFESSOR Please, let's get on with the case. Gilligan's council returns to their bench. Mr. Howell returns to the witness stand. MR HOWELL Now, Missus Howell, if you please. MRS HOWELL Well, now, let's see. Oh, that was the morning that Mister Howell offered Gilligan a job. And he agreed to dig the barbecue pit. MR HOWELL Thank you very much, Missus Howell. Your witness. SKIPPER (aside to Gilligan) Watch me break her testimony. (to witness) Missus Howell, did Mister Howell use those exact words -- that he had a "job for him," or did he say that he had "something he wanted Gilligan to do" for him? MR HOWELL I object! PROFESSOR What is your objection? MR HOWELL Just give me a minute, I'll think of something. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Ginger sits on the witness stand. Mr. Howell examines her. MR HOWELL Miss Ginger Grant, just tell the court do you recall hearing me say that I was hiring Gilligan? GINGER Yes, Mister Howell. You told me that you'd just hired Gilligan to dig the barbecue pit. SKIPPER Howell bribed her the same way he tried to bribe you. MR HOWELL That is defamation of character. I want to sue that man for libel and slander. PROFESSOR That will be case number five. Professor pounds the gavel. Milk squirts onto Mr. Howell. GINGER He said I was bribed. I want to file charges, too. PROFESSOR Case number six. Professor pounds the gavel. MR HOWELL Your Honor, I do wish you'd get another gavel. Mr. Howell wipes the coconut milk from his glasses and face. SKIPPER (sotto, to Gilligan) Ginger's very damaging to us. GILLIGAN (sotto, to Skipper) Yeah, her testimony. SKIPPER (sotto, to Gilligan) No, her legs. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann sits on the witness stand. Skipper examines her. MARY ANN I'd gone to ask Gilligan if I could help him with his fish trap. But he said he first had to do "a favor" for Mister Howell. SKIPPER A-ha. It was "a favor." MR HOWELL Your Honor, I want to file charges against Mary Ann. PROFESSOR Against Mary Ann, for what? MR HOWELL For murder. PROFESSOR Murder? MR HOWELL Her testimony is killing me. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan sits on the witness stand. Skipper examines him. SKIPPER Did Mister Howell at any time ever call it a job? GILLIGAN No. SKIPPER Did he, in fact, ever pay you any money for it? GILLIGAN No. SKIPPER (sotto, to Gilligan) Nice testimony, Gilligan. Now, if you get stuck for an answer during the rest of the trial, just look over at me, and I'll hold up a finger. (to court) Your witness, Mr. Howell. Mr. Howell cross-examines Gilligan. MR HOWELL Gilligan, my boy, isn't it true that I hired you that morning? SKIPPER holds up his thumb. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan holds up his thumb. Mr. Howell notices. GILLIGAN You asked me if I had time to do something for you. SKIPPER brushes a BUZZING fly away. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN (cont'd) You never paid me a single penny. MR HOWELL I didn't ask that. SKIPPER holds up four fingers and tries to grab the BUZZING fly. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN You showed me where you wanted the barbecue pit. MR HOWELL Your Honor! GILLIGAN You never talked about something for me to penny mention work a barbecue pit. Gilligan realizes what he said makes no sense. Mr. Howell approaches the bench. MR HOWELL Your Honor, they're using signals. I want to file charges. Skipper approaches the bench. SKIPPER They'll have to wait for mine. PROFESSOR Order in the court! Professor pounds his gavel down on the bench. Coconut milk flies everywhere. Mr. Howell and Skipper flee the bench. MR HOWELL Watch it! Professor pounds the gavel again. PROFESSOR Order in the court! EXT. CAMP - LATER Skipper sits at counsel's table. Gilligan paces behind him. GILLIGAN The Professor's been thinking for half an hour. What could he be thinking about? SKIPPER Sit down, Gilligan. You're making me nervous. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Professor paces and thinks. He comes to a conclusion and exits. EXT. CAMP - CONTINUOUS Mary Ann sees Professor exiting the jungle. She stands up. The other castaways stand and approach the bench. MARY ANN Oh! Rise everybody! The judge is coming back. Professor enters. PROFESSOR Ladies and gentlemen, I have reached a decision. MR HOWELL Well, don't keep the boy waiting any longer. Tell him I've won the verdict. PROFESSOR Oh, I can't tell him that. SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan, that means the treasure chest is yours. PROFESSOR No, wait, wait. Gilligan didn't win, either. GILLIGAN Huh? PROFESSOR Well, let me explain. Ever since we were shipwrecked on this island we've shared the hardships, the work, the fish we catch, the fruit, the water, everything. We've shared and we've shared alike. And I choose to look upon the treasure chest as one of the natural resources of this island. By custom and usage, (in Latin) de facto. It belongs to all of us. GILLIGAN Oh. Well, let's go open it. Come on, come on. MR HOWELL Yes, yes. The castaways leave camp for the treasure chest. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY TREASURE CHEST hangs from the vine. BACK TO SCENE The castaways gather near the vine suspending the treasure chest. SKIPPER Gold. MRS HOWELL Diamonds. GILLIGAN There it is. Professor carries a knife over to the vine tied to the tree. He holds onto it and raises his arm with the knife to cut the vine. MR HOWELL Wait, don't cut that, Professor. I've got to own that treasure chest. Now, no one has seen it. I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for your five shares of it. GINGER A hundred thousand dollars? PROFESSOR That's twenty thousand dollars apiece. SKIPPER I'll take the treasure chest. GILLIGAN Me, too. MARY ANN The treasure. GINGER Cut the vine, Professor. Professor moves to cut the vine. MR HOWELL Stop! Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The other castaways shake their heads. Professor moves to cut the vine. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Stop! A half a million. Ginger gasps. GINGER That's a hundred thousand apiece. The other castaways nod in agreement. GINGER (cont'd) Yes. PROFESSOR Mister Howell, you've just bought yourself a treasure. Professor cuts the vine. The treasure chest drops to the ground and busts open. TREASURE CHEST lies on its side, the top opens by gravity and the force of the contents within. Dozens of black spheres, about 3-1/2 inches in diameter, are revealed. BACK TO SCENE The castaways look at the content and try to figure out what they are. The Howells move closer. MR HOWELL Look at that: Big, giant, black pearls. Mrs. Howell picks up one of the black spheres. MRS HOWELL I wonder what they did to get a little oyster to make a pearl this size. MR HOWELL They must've used whips. Mary Ann looks disapprovingly at Ginger. Mr. Howell looks at the black sphere more closely. MR HOWELL (cont'd) No, no. It's a cannonball. Mr. Howell sobs and drops to his knees. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Five hundred thousand dollars, I paid for one broken box of cannonballs. Mrs. Howell comforts him. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper and Mr. Howell discuss the treasure. Mr. Howell tosses a cannonball in the air and catches it repeatedly. MR HOWELL It was sporting of all of you not to accept the money. SKIPPER Oh, we couldn't, Mister Howell. We all thought there was treasure in that chest. MR HOWELL I still say it was sporting. Stupid, but sporting. Mr. Howell sits down to Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL Darling, it's your toss. MR HOWELL Oh-oh, yes. Yes, of course. Mr. Howell gets up. Skipper watches intently. Mr. Howell rolls the ball down the bowling lane. Gilligan sits above the the gourds acting as bowling pins. Mr. Howell's throw knocks over some gourds. Gilligan jumps down and counts the gourds knocked over. GILLIGAN That's pretty good, Mister Howell. You got two, four, six gourds. Gilligan rolls the cannonball up the ball return chute. Mr. Howell readies his second ball. MR HOWELL Well, as I always say, the family that bowls together, splits. Mr. Howell throws his second ball. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY FADE OUT. THE END 
Episode #15, “So Sorry, My Island Now” A Japanese solder arrives on the island, thinks it's still WWII, and holds the castaways prisoner on their own island.  “So Sorry, My Island Now”  By  David P. Harmon  January 9, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON - DAY Gilligan wades in the lagoon and fishes for lobsters. He captures a lobster, struggles with it, and places it into his bag. A periscope pops out of the water behind Gilligan. ZOOM ON PERISCOPE GILLIGAN senses someone, or something, is watching him. BACK TO SCENE He slowly turns around. The periscope lowers under the water and disappears. Gilligan turns around, scratches his head, and continues lobster fishing. Gilligan looks up from the water. He senses he's being watched. The periscope pops out of the water. Gilligan starts to turn around. The periscope dives below the surface again. Gilligan turns around. The periscope bubbles behind him. The periscope emerges from the water. Gilligan turns. The periscope disappears again. Gilligan notices something in the water in front of him. He watches the periscope pop out of the water. It is covered in seaweed. He stares into its lens. He thinks it is a sea monster and this scares him, so he yells for help. He abandons his lobster bag and runs ashore. GILLIGAN Help! Sea monster! Help! Run for your lives! It's a sea monster! FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan explains to Skipper and Professor what he saw. GILLIGAN And then I see the saw serpent. I mean, I sir the saw sepent. SKIPPER Gilligan, little buddy, please. Now, calm down and just tell us what happened. GILLIGAN That's what I'm trying to do. I was fishing for lobster when suddenly I saw the sir sepent. Gilligan forms the neck and head of a sea serpent with his arm, as if he had a sea serpent puppet on his hand. It looks at him and then at the others. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I saw a thing. Gilligan moves his hand, acting as the serpent's head, back and forth. PROFESSOR Gilligan, your panic is perfectly understandable. GILLIGAN It is? PROFESSOR Naturally. Anyone who saw a sea serpent would be terrified. GILLIGAN Then how come everybody is standing around like I didn't see one? PROFESSOR Because you didn't. GILLIGAN He had one big eye and a long neck and was covered with green things. PROFESSOR Listen to me, Gilligan. There is no such thing as a sea serpent. Sailing men from time immemorial, in Norse legends, in Greek mythology, in Phoenician times, all thought they saw things that didn't exist. GILLIGAN They did? PROFESSOR Actually what they saw was a giant squid, or a whale, or an overgrown eel, or even an octopus. Now, which one did you see? GILLIGAN The one with one big eye, a long neck, and is covered with green things. PROFESSOR I give up. Skipper, you talk to him. Professor exits and walks into the hut. GILLIGAN Skipper, I saw it with my own two eyes. It has one big eye-- As he moves his hand to demonstrate the sea serpent, Gilligan pokes his sea serpent hand into Skipper's eye. Skipper takes Gilligan's arm and moves it away from this eye. SKIPPER Gilligan, do you trust me? GILLIGAN Of course I do. SKIPPER Then go back down to the lagoon and start picking more lobsters. GILLIGAN But, Skipper, what if it-- SKIPPER Gilligan, all you have to do is just say to yourself, "There is no sea serpent. There is no sea serpent. There is no sea serpent. There is no sea serpent." FLIP TO: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan stands looking over the water. Mr. Howell enters from behind him. Mr. Howell taps Gilligan on the shoulder. GILLIGAN There is, too, a sea serpent. Gilligan turns and sees Mr. Howell. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Oh, it's you, Mister Howell. You scared me. MR HOWELL I, Thurston Howell the Third, scare you? That's absurd, my boy. GILLIGAN I know it is. I thought you were a sea monster, with one big eye, a long neck, and green things. MR HOWELL Please, I don't think I look like that. GILLIGAN Not you, the sea monster. That's how he looks. MR HOWELL Well, perhaps I can help you capture this creature from the deep. GILLIGAN Capture it? MR HOWELL Yes, I'll take it home and give it the freedom of my swimming pool. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Can't you just picture it, Gilligan, my boy? My guests, all full of the bubbly, falling into the pool, one of them coming up astride a sea serpent. Mr. Howell pats Gilligan on the bottom. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Such laughs! GILLIGAN You don't believe me, either. MR HOWELL No, no, of course not. No, I don't. I think it's just a giant squid or an octopus. However, if you spot a mermaid, ... Mr. Howell taps the back of his hand on Gilligan's abdomen. MR HOWELL (cont'd) ... sing out! Mr. Howell walks along the lagoon beach and exits. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY Mr. Howell continues his walk back to camp through the jungle. MR HOWELL If he spots a mermaid. That boy, I tell you. Mr. Howell stops on the path. A Japanese sailor appears from the jungle foliage and approaches Mr. Howell. He pokes Mr. Howell with his bayonet. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Be careful. That point is pointy. Mr. Howell turns slightly and sees the Japanese sailor. MR HOWELL (cont'd) By George! And I've got the money to buy George. That's a Japanese sailor. The sailor motions for Mr. Howell to be quiet and then motions Mr. Howell into the jungle. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY JAPANESE SAILOR You officer? MR HOWELL I'll have you know I'm an officer in eleven different companies. JAPANESE SAILOR Good. Good. MR HOWELL I have divisions in England, France, Italy, the Near East, Far East, and Middle East! JAPANESE SAILOR It's a great honor -- The Japanese sailor bows to Mr. Howell. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) -- to capture you. MR HOWELL Capture me? JAPANESE SAILOR You prisoner. Come with me. MR HOWELL Wait a minute! That's incredible! That's impossible! The sailor points the bayonet at Mr. Howell's face. MR HOWELL (cont'd) It's credible and possible. Mr. Howell slowly moves the bayonet away from his face and bows. MR HOWELL (cont'd) (Japanese) Sayonara. The Japanese sailor bows in return. JAPANESE SAILOR (Japanese) Sayonara. Mr. Howell turns and the Japanese sailor follows. They exit. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan tries to explain to Professor what happened. GILLIGAN One minute Mr. Howell was there, the next, he was gone. Ginger, dressed in an evening gown, enters from the jungle. PROFESSOR Mister Howell always manages to be somewhere else when there's work to do. He's hiding. GILLIGAN But this is the first time ever in the stomach of a sea serpent. GINGER Hi. GILLIGAN (to Ginger) Hi. And don't go swimming. GINGER I'm not exactly dressed for it. PROFESSOR Ginger, see if you can calm him down. GINGER You do look kind of worried, Gilligan. GILLIGAN No, I'm not worried. Not in the least bit. Scared, yeah. But not worried. PROFESSOR He's upset because he thinks Mister Howell has disappeared. GINGER Oh. Would you like me to help you go look for him? GILLIGAN No. GINGER Well, I could go first. GILLIGAN It's too dangerous for a lady. GINGER You could go first. GILLIGAN It's too dangerous for a man. How about you? You'll go with us? PROFESSOR No, Gilligan. I'm going to stay right here and finish my work. Professor gets up from the table and exits. Gilligan heads for the lagoon and waves Ginger to follow him. Ginger follows. EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY TRACK WITH GILLIGAN AND GINGER AS THEY WALK THROUGH THE JUNGLE GILLIGAN You still behind me, Ginger? GINGER I'm right behind you, Gilligan. GILLIGAN I was walking along this path, not even thinking of lobsters, let alone sea monsters, and believe me, I'd let alone sea monsters if I had my choice. Ginger is grabbed by the sailor and taken in the foliage. EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan emerges from the jungle at the lagoon. GILLIGAN And I was standing right over here. Mister Howell came up to me and then started walking up the beach. And I stood here -- Ginger, are you still behind me? Gilligan reaches behind without turning around to feel whether Ginger is still there. He doesn't feel her. Gilligan turns around and hears Ginger's SCREAM. Gilligan bites his fingernails in fear. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mrs. Howell carries a parasol. Professor enters from the hut. Mary Ann walks toward Mrs. Howell. ZOOM IN ON MARY ANN, PROFESSOR, AND MRS. HOWELL MARY ANN What was that? MRS HOWELL It sounded like Ginger. PROFESSOR She's with Gilligan. MRS HOWELL Oh, Professor, I refuse to listen to anything more. Gilligan's a very nice little boy. PROFESSOR I didn't mean it like that. MARY ANN Well, what's happening? PROFESSOR Well, I was about to tell Missus Howell her husband was eaten by a sea serpent. MRS HOWELL Oh, That's silly. Thurston wasn't even dressed for dinner. Did you say he was eaten by a sea serpent? PROFESSOR No, no, no. Gilligan said it. MRS HOWELL Oh, that's different. PROFESSOR Missus Howell, you stay and wait for the Skipper. Send him down to the lagoon. Come on, Mary Ann. The Professor grasps Mary Ann's arm and pulls Mary Ann with him. PROFESSOR (cont'd) I'll explain on the way. They exit. EXT. LAGOON - DAY Gilligan wades in the lagoon, pushing water aside to look for Ginger. GILLIGAN I'll save you, Ginger! Don't give up, Ginger! Professor and Mary Ann emerge from the jungle. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hold your breath, I'll save you! MARY ANN You don't believe him, do you? PROFESSOR No. But there may be trouble. You stay here. MARY ANN Why? PROFESSOR Because I'm going to find out exactly what's happening. The Professor wades into the lagoon to join Gilligan. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Gilligan. Gilligan, what happened? GILLIGAN The sea serpent ate Ginger. PROFESSOR Why did she scream? GILLIGAN Because it hurts. PROFESSOR Gilligan, will you get hold of yourself and tell me, step by step, exactly what happened? GILLIGAN Well, Ginger and me came down from the camp to the beach -- That is, I did. Ginger became an appetizer. PROFESSOR In other words, she was standing right where Mary Ann is now. Gilligan looks to the beach. GILLIGAN Where Mary Ann isn't. PROFESSOR Gilligan, for the last time -- The Professor turns and looks to the beach. Mary Ann isn't there. PROFESSOR'S POV - EMPTY LAGOON BEACH A gong RINGS. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Mary Ann. Gilligan and Professor race from the lagoon to the beach. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Mary Ann? Gilligan and Professor race from the water to the beach. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY The Professor and Gilligan race into the jungle. PROFESSOR Mary Ann? GILLIGAN Professor, it's no use, it's just no use. Mary Ann's become a salad. PROFESSOR Gilligan, there's a perfectly logical and normal reason for what's happening. GILLIGAN A hungry sea serpent. PROFESSOR Nonsense. GILLIGAN Maybe you're right. After Mister Howell, Ginger, and Mary Ann, he's probably full. PROFESSOR Gilligan, I'll stand guard here. You go to camp and help Missus Howell find the Skipper. GILLIGAN You'll stay right here? PROFESSOR I promise. GILLIGAN Even if you're eaten? PROFESSOR Gilligan, will you hurry up? GILLIGAN Right. Gilligan exits into the foliage. The Professor looks around for Mary Ann. PROFESSOR Mary Ann? EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan enters from the jungle. GILLIGAN Help! Hey, Skipper? Missus Howell? Gilligan sees Mrs. Howell's parasol. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Oh, poor Missus Howell. Well, at least she's with Mister Howell now. Skipper enters from the jungle carrying firewood. SKIPPER Gilligan. Skipper startles Gilligan. GILLIGAN Oh, Skipper, am I glad to see you. SKIPPER I thought I told you to go get some lobsters. GILLIGAN Was that a big mistake. SKIPPER Where is everybody? GILLIGAN Out to lunch. SKIPPER Out to lunch? GILLIGAN The hard way. SKIPPER Gilligan, please, now why don't you start making some sense? GILLIGAN Right, make some sense. Where should I begin? SKIPPER Well, if you start at the beginning, that's always a good place. GILLIGAN I was catching lobsters, right? SKIPPER Right. GILLIGAN Then I saw a sea serpent. SKIPPER Right. GILLIGAN Then he ate Mr. Howell, Ginger, Mary Ann, and poor Missus Howell. SKIPPER Gilligan. Skipper covers Gilligan's mouth with his hand so Gilligan can't talk. SKIPPER (cont'd) I'm not gonna lose my temper, am I? I'm not gonna get angry and blow my top, am I? No, I'm just gonna make you start over. Skipper removes his hand from Gilligan's mouth. GILLIGAN You don't believe me, do you? SKIPPER Little buddy, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but no, I don't believe you. GILLIGAN Then I don't want to talk about it. SKIPPER Now, tell me what happened. GILLIGAN Nothing happened. SKIPPER Gilligan, where has everybody gone? GILLIGAN You and me are here, the Professor's at the beach, and the rest all got eaten up by a -- Skipper covers Gilligan's hand. Gilligan bites the Skipper's hand. GILLIGAN (cont'd) -- sea serpent. So there. SKIPPER I suppose that you saw them eaten by the sea serpent? GILLIGAN No, not exactly. SKIPPER Now we're getting someplace. GILLIGAN We are? SKIPPER Yes, we are. We're getting to the beach and find the Professor. Skipper motions for Gilligan to follow him. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, come on. GILLIGAN Not me, I'm not going back down there. SKIPPER All right, suit yourself. But don't forget to say hello to Missus Howell for me. Skipper turns and exits into the jungle. Gilligan opens the parasol and is startled when he figures out what the Skipper meant. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY DOLLY FROM WOMEN'S CELL TO BOYS CELL AND ZOOM PROFESSOR Very ingenious. Very ingenious. MR HOWELL Well, I'm glad that you approve. PROFESSOR You notice how he's got this constructed? If we try to squeeze through, or push or pull these bamboo poles, it tightens the wire and pulls the pin out of the grenade. Pow, splash, pow! MR HOWELL Must you be so graphic? PROFESSOR You don't understand, Mister Howell. It could be to our advantage. MR HOWELL The "pow" or the "splash"? PROFESSOR I only meant that we might be able to reason with this Japanese sailor. Only an intelligent person could construct such a barricade as quickly and efficiently as he did. MR HOWELL Well, he's smarter than we are. PROFESSOR What do you mean? MR HOWELL He's outside. We're inside. The sailor looks up and down at Ginger and cat whistles. MRS HOWELL Oh, he speaks English! The Japanese sailor walks over to the cell holding the men. JAPANESE SAILOR All right now. Time for interrogation. PROFESSOR Now look, this is really all quite unnecessary. The war has been over for more than twenty years. MR HOWELL I've heard of sore losers, but he's ridiculous. The Japanese sailor makes comments in Japanese. The Japanese sailor continues on in Japanese. JAPANESE SAILOR You don't call me ridiculous! PROFESSOR Surely you must have heard about the ending of the war on your radio. JAPANESE SAILOR Radio broke in nineteen forty-two. Transmitter, too. But pretty soon, I get spare parts. PROFESSOR When? JAPANESE SAILOR When I get leave. Best spare parts come -- Japan. Cheaper, too. MR HOWELL Have you heard about our discount houses? JAPANESE SAILOR You talk in code? Don't talk in code! Just give me information of the supply depot, ammunition, headquarters, everything! PROFESSOR Now look, there is no ammunition. There are no headquarters. The war is over! JAPANESE SAILOR What's the matter with you? You think I'm dumbbell, huh? I know American. I went to American college. I graduated you-see-el-ay. MR HOWELL Well, that explains everything. PROFESSOR What do you mean? MR HOWELL He's obviously not a Harvard man. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Look at the cut of his trousers. The Japanese sailor looks down at his feet and then back up at Mr. Howell. EXT. LAGOON - DAY FOLIAGE Gilligan clears foliage away from a tiny one-person Japanese submarine. The tower has a World War II-era "rising sun" Japanese flag and Japanese glyphs. DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL Gilligan and Skipper sit on a large log at the edge of the lagoon. The submarine was hidden there by the foliage. They clear all of the foliage away. SKIPPER I don't believe it. I don't believe it. GILLIGAN I believe it. It's right here. SKIPPER I haven't seen one of these since the war. GILLIGAN Which one is it, the Monitor or the Merrimack? SKIPPER Not the Civil War, you lunkhead. Look at the name of the boat. Skipper points. SUBMARINE Gilligan clears bits of foliage that remain, revealing Japanese glyphs. GILLIGAN Somebody sure has terrible handwriting. I can't make out you-ess-ess-anything. SKIPPER SKIPPER Gilligan, it's Japanese. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN Oh. Gilligan opens the submarine's HATCH. SKIPPER This clears a lot of things up. It's in the papers all the time. Every year you read where they left some Japanese on a deserted island and they don't know the war is over yet. GILLIGAN It looked a lot bigger when it was a sea serpent. SKIPPER He must have the rest of the group held captive. GILLIGAN Then it's up to us to save them, huh? SKIPPER That's right, Gilligan. All I have to do is get in the sub, sail to Hawaii, -- BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER (cont'd) -- and bring back help. GILLIGAN You're a genius, Skipper. Skipper steps into the submarine's open hatch. SKIPPER I know. And with the sub gone, it wouldn't make sense. The sailor wouldn't dare kill you and the rest of the group. GILLIGAN Me? Me? How do I get captured? SKIPPER I've got faith in you, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Oh, thanks, Skipper. Skipper tries to get his torso and arms into the submarine, but he's too large. Gilligan tries to close the hatch before Skipper is all the way inside. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Bon voyage, Skipper. Have a good trip. SKIPPER Wait a minute, Gilligan! Gilligan returns the hatch to its open position. SKIPPER (cont'd) I'm stuck. GILLIGAN You mean you can't get in? SKIPPER No, Gilligan. GILLIGAN And you can't get out? SKIPPER No, Gilligan! GILLIGAN That's why you're stuck. SKIPPER Yes, Gilligan. FLIP TO: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan pours a bucket of coconut oil around the Skipper. GILLIGAN Here. Some coconut oil to make you slippery. SKIPPER Coconut oil is gooey. GILLIGAN Yeah, it'll make you more slippery. Here, come on. Let's go. Gilligan pulls out Skipper's arms. GILLIGAN (cont'd) See? SKIPPER It'll work! GILLIGAN Yeah, come on. Let's go. Gilligan frees Skipper's arms. Then he turns Skipper around counterclockwise as if he was a screw in a hole. Skipper sinks into the submarine. SKIPPER Gilligan, you're turning me the wrong way! GILLIGAN Oh-oh. Here. Gilligan turns Skipper clockwise and Skipper rises out of the submarine. Skipper rises out of the submarine to his waist. GILLIGAN (cont'd) See, it worked! SKIPPER That's right, little buddy, it worked fine. Get ready. You're going to have to captain the submarine. GILLIGAN Me? Skipper climbs out of the submarine. SKIPPER Yes. Get down there behind that wheel. It's simple. Just drive it like an automobile. GILLIGAN Are you sure? Gilligan climbs into the submarine. SKIPPER Yes. Just look at the dashboard and follow the instructions. GILLIGAN If you say so. SKIPPER Head northwest, and you'll hit Hawaii. GILLIGAN You can depend on me, Skipper. SKIPPER I wish you hadn't said that, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Just remember, your life is in my hands. SKIPPER Wish you hadn't said that, either. Gilligan smiles back at Skipper. GILLIGAN Here goes! Gilligan pilots the submarine away from the log dock into the lagoon. Skipper waves. Gilligan pulls the submarine away from the dock. SKIPPER Good luck, little buddy. Skipper looks on. Gilligan submerges the submarine, but the submarine fills with water because he forgot to close the hatch. Skipper grimaces. Gilligan is soaking wet. He pokes his head out of the submarine. GILLIGAN I forgot it was a convertible. Skipper laughs. Gilligan pulls the hatch closed. The submarine re-submerges. Skipper sees that Gilligan finally gets the hang of it. The periscope is the only part of the submarine that is visible. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Skipper observes Gilligan in the submarine. The periscope travels around the lagoon in circular patterns. Skipper expresses disappointment. The periscope continues to travel around the lagoon. Skipper turns to sit down on the log. The periscope travels through the lagoon. The periscope completely submerges and then emerges from the lagoon. Skipper frantically watches Gilligan go around the lagoon in circles. A CRASH sounds. SKIPPER No, no! Gilligan opens the HATCH and emerges from the submarine. GILLIGAN Hey, you! There's seven people captured on an island by a Japanese sailor! Hey, you! Gilligan runs toward Skipper. Gilligan runs toward Skipper. He grabs his arm without looking at his face closely. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Look, I know exactly where they are. Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up. We've got to hurry. Come on, let's go! Gilligan pulls Skipper back toward the submarine. GILLIGAN (cont'd) It's the Navy. Follow me. I know exactly where they are. Come on. Skipper pulls is arm free. SKIPPER Gilligan! GILLIGAN Skipper? How did you get in Hawaii? SKIPPER You never left the lagoon. GILLIGAN I didn't? SKIPPER No, Gilligan. I told you to head northwest. GILLIGAN I know that. SKIPPER Then why didn't you do what I told you? GILLIGAN Because you didn't tell me what northwest looked like in Japanese. SKIPPER Japanese? GILLIGAN Yeah, all the directions down there are written like that. Gilligan points to the ship name on the side of the submarine. SKIPPER I never thought of that. But Gilligan, we've got to find that sailor and have him teach you. GILLIGAN I could learn real fast. SKIPPER Good, Gilligan. Now, if you were a Japanese sailor, where would you be? GILLIGAN In Tokyo. SKIPPER I mean here on the island, Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) We've got to find that Japanese sailor. Come on. They exit. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY Professor and Mr. Howell talk to the Japanese sailor from their bamboo cell. MR HOWELL Would you settle for general manager of my European sales force? JAPANESE SAILOR I'm Japanese sailor! Imperial Navy. I'm loyal to my Emperor. MR HOWELL Loyalty is something I admire in every man. It's a positive virtue. But would you be loyal, say, to fifty thousand dollars? JAPANESE SAILOR No, no, no! But thank you for important information. MR HOWELL Information? What information? JAPANESE SAILOR That war is nearly over, and that American Army is in bad, bad shape. MR HOWELL I never said the American Army was in bad shape. JAPANESE SAILOR Must be, to make man like you -- officer. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) I go talk to lady prisoner. (in Japanese) Thank you. The Japanese sailor turns and walks over the women's cell. The Japanese sailor unlocks the chain on the door, enters the cell, and re-locks the chain on the door. He eyes Ginger up and down. He sees Mrs. Howell. He walks over to her while wagging his finger. He looks Mrs. Howell up and down. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) You are married to big mouth, huh? MRS HOWELL I am Missus Thurston Howell the Third. JAPANESE SAILOR Have been two other like that? Mrs. Howell bounces her hair. MRS HOWELL There may be a Thurston Howell the Fourth. Japanese Sailor gives an aside glance. JAPANESE SAILOR Wonder why Emperor want United States? Japanese sailor looks back at Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL I demand you let us out of here immediately. JAPANESE SAILOR No can do. MRS HOWELL Then I have nothing more to say to you, you camera bug! JAPANESE SAILOR I change my mind. MRS HOWELL Then you're going to let us go free? JAPANESE SAILOR No. I was going to torture your husband, but now I'll leave that to you. MRS HOWELL Oh, Mary Ann, I think I've been insulted! The Japanese sailor walks over to Mary Ann. JAPANESE SAILOR You I not ask yet. Maybe you give me information, huh? MARY ANN I'd rather die. JAPANESE SAILOR That could be arranged. Ginger walks and pretends to sprain her ankle. The Japanese sailor notices Ginger's sprain. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) Don't go away, no. American movie star, she hurt! He walks over to Ginger. GINGER I -- I think I sprained my ankle. JAPANESE SAILOR That's too bad. GINGER Maybe if you rub it. I mean, men's hands are so strong. JAPANESE SAILOR I was the strongest sailor in all navy. I broke five boards, one inch thick, with karate. GINGER And you're so handsome, too. JAPANESE SAILOR Handsome? No. GINGER (sultry) Yes, you are. JAPANESE SAILOR Good-rooking, maybe. GINGER Very good-rooking. JAPANESE SAILOR You're good-rooking, too. GINGER Thanks. You know, if we were back in Hollywood now, why they'd go crazy about you. JAPANESE SAILOR Hollywood? Me, in the movies? GINGER Oh, yes. There's lots and lots of parts for big, strong Japanese men. JAPANESE SAILOR I could play a movie star, like Robert Taylor? Or like Robert Montgomery? How about the other one, Rroyd Bridges? GINGER Yes. You've got such smooth hair -- and a handsome face. JAPANESE SAILOR And good-rooking? GINGER Very good-rooking. And strong hands. The Japanese sailor's glasses are completely fogged up. JAPANESE SAILOR Oh, please. You steam grasses. MARY ANN Ginger, I wouldn't do that. The Japanese sailor has removed his fogged glasses. GINGER Why not? MARY ANN I don't think he's had a shore leave in over twenty years. MRS HOWELL I demand that you release us. MARY ANN After all, the war is over. GINGER And I won't speak to you again if you don't. JAPANESE SAILOR How you say "no" in English? (pause) No! The Japanese sailor puts his glasses back on, turns, and exits. Ginger is surprised that her seduction didn't work. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY Skipper and Gilligan spy on the sailor. JAPANESE SAILOR I don't sleep for forty-eight hours. I must sleep. MR HOWELL You seem to be forgetting the rules of the Geneva Conference. Officers are entitled to special treatment. The Japanese sailor slowly walks over to the men's cell. JAPANESE SAILOR You get special prison camp. MR HOWELL I'm referring to the cocktail hour. JAPANESE SAILOR (to Professor) You sure he's on your side? PROFESSOR Not always. JAPANESE SAILOR I sleep over there, huh. Don't you escape, huh? MR HOWELL Escape? The way you've fixed this chicken coop, how am I going to escape? JAPANESE SAILOR True. PROFESSOR Say, how did you learn to do this? JAPANESE SAILOR Pictures. American pictures with John Wayne. Professor and Mr. Howell exchange glances. The Japanese sailor walks away from the men's cell. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY They watch from a concealed position. SKIPPER He's up there. Skipper points to the tree. GILLIGAN Oh. The Japanese sailor positions himself to be comfortable and sleep. GILLIGAN (cont'd) What are we gonna do? SKIPPER Watch and see what he does. Keep an eye on him. GILLIGAN But what are you gonna do? SKIPPER I'm going to let them out. GILLIGAN Okay. SKIPPER If he makes a move, whistle. GILLIGAN Like this? Gilligan whistles loudly. Skipper covers Gilligan's mouth with his hand. SKIPPER Want to get us captured? Gilligan shakes his head. GILLIGAN No. Skipper rises to covertly release the captive castaways. The Japanese sailor sleeps. Skipper crawls past Gilligan. SKIPPER I'm counting on you, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Don't worry, Skipper. Your life is in my hands. SKIPPER I wish you wouldn't keep saying that. Watch him. The Japanese sailor is in a deep sleep. He snores. Skipper crawls along the ground to the bamboo cells. Gilligan watches Skipper. The Japanese sailor sleeps. He hasn't moved from his previous position. Skipper crawls along the ground. Once he gets to the girl's cell, Skipper rises to his knees. GINGER Oh, am I glad-- Skipper shushes her. SKIPPER (sotto) I'll have you out of here in no time. PROFESSOR (O.S.) (sotto) Skipper, it'll take you a week to saw through those, even if you had a saw. PAN WITH Skipper walks to the men's cell and reaches to pry the bars apart. MR HOWELL (sotto) Don't do that! SKIPPER (sotto) Why not? MR HOWELL (sotto) Well, because of pow and smash -- and other gory details I can't go into right now. PROFESSOR He's got it rigged with grenades. The slightest pressure, and -- SKIPPER Pow. They nod. SKIPPER (cont'd) I'll dig you out. PAN ON Skipper moves around to the side of the cell. The Japanese sailor can be seen at the other end of the bamboo jail clearing. Skipper moves to the back of the cell and starts digging with his hands. Gilligan sees the sailor is asleep. The sailor holds a rifle with bayonet. A machine gun sits at the base of the tree. Gilligan approaches the sailor and climbs the tree. The sailor slaps at an insect on his leg. Gilligan puts his head near the sailor's knee. The sailor slaps another insect and his hand lands on Gilligan's head. He scratches Gilligan's head and Gilligan scratches the sailor's knee. The sailor taps his fingers on Gilligan's head and Gilligan mimics that motion too. The sailor finally pulls his hand away, but he flexes his leg and kicks Gilligan on the chin. Gilligan climbs up further and unties the cord wrapped around the sailor's neck that holds a key. Gilligan puts the key in his back pocket. He takes the sailor's hand and curls his index finger into a hook and places the finger in the sailor's breast pocket. Gilligan removes the rifle and bayonet from the sailor. HIGH ANGLE ON Skipper digs. Gilligan, with rifle, bayonet, machine gun, and key in hand, walks up behind Skipper. GILLIGAN Skipper, how you doing? Skipper shushes him. SKIPPER Don't bother me. I'm doing fine. PAN ON Gilligan walks to the women's cell. GILLIGAN Hi, girls. Gilligan leans the machine gun on the cell near Mary Ann. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Here, hold this, will you? Gilligan unlocks the women's cell. The women escape. Mary Ann drags the machine gun. MRS HOWELL (sotto) Gilligan. Gilligan goes to the men's cell and unlocks it. They escape. The castaways gather behind Skipper as he digs. Gilligan hands Skipper the bayonet. HIGH ANGLE ON SKIPPER GILLIGAN Here you are, Skipper, use this. It might go a little faster. SKIPPER Thanks, Gilligan. SKIPPER sees that he's surrounded by feet and that Gilligan has freed the other castaways. Skipper gives an aside glance. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY The tree where the sailor slept is empty. EXT. CAMP - DAY SKIPPER He's gone! He was the only one who could've taught us to run that submarine. GILLIGAN He can't be, Skipper. He can't be. GINGER Oh, I think he's headed for Hollywood. SKIPPER We've got to get to that sub before he does. Come on. FLIP TO: EXT.

Gilligan turns around. He's wearing the Japanese sailor's glasses. GILLIGAN (cont'd) (faux Japanese accent) He not have grasses on. Gilligan puts his hands together and tips his head forward, as if to bow. FADE OUT. THE END 
Episode #3, "Voodoo Something to Me" The Skipper thinks that the island is full of 'VooDoo' when he thinks that Gilligan has been turned into a chimp.   GILLIGAN'S ISLAND  Voodoo Something to Me  By  Austin Kalish  and  Elroy Schwartz   October 10, 1964  TEASER FADE IN  STOCK SHOT OF BEACH/OCEAN THROUGH PALM TREES - CREDITS OVERLAY  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF SUNSET THROUGH PALM TREES  CUT TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - NIGHT CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  PULL BACK TO WIDE SHOT  We see Gilligan standing alone near a fire at night with his right hand resting on a pistol. His head is cocked to one side as we hear him snoring. He's supposed to be on sentry duty. We see the skipper emerge from one of the huts.  SKIPPER All right folks it's time.  All the other castaways emerge in a very tired and groggy state from the other hut.  MARY ANN Evening skipper.  SKIPPER Evening ladies.  GINGER Good evening skipper.  SKIPPER (TO GILLIGAN) No cause for alarm Gilligan, it's the skipper.  Gilligan doesn't respond. The group walks along with the skipper and stops behind Gilligan. The skipper stands to Gilligan's right as Ginger stands to his left.  SKIPPER Oh, always remember to identify yourselves when Gilligan's on watch. He tends to be trigger-happy. He shoots first and asks questions later.  The skipper approaches the still sleeping Gilligan.  SKIPPER Gilligan is everything all right?  Again no response.  SKIPPER Gilligan?  And again nothing. The skipper has had it now.  SKIPPER GILLIGAN!!  That got Gilligan's attention. He immediately pulls his pistol, raises it up at arms length and shoots. The skipper ducks under Gilligan's arm to avoid being shot.  GILLIGAN Halt or I'll shoot!!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan realizes it's the skipper only after the skipper ducks out of the way.  GILLIGAN Oh hi skipper.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER, MARY ANN AND THE PROFESSOR  GINGER We're terribly sorry to wake you when you're on sentry duty Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Oh that's all right.  SKIPPER All right folks, flare time.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER, MARY ANN AND THE PROFESSOR  MARY ANN Why do we fire off a flare every night? We don't even know if there's a ship out there.  PROFESSOR But we don't know there isn't one either. Might be a freighter or an oil tanker.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MRS HOWELL A freighter or an oil tanker? Ich!  MR HOWELL Well that's all right Lovey, we can wait for a yacht.  SKIPPER Everybody gather over here now. Keep your fingers crossed.

A loud bang followed by.  CUT TO: STOCK FOOTAGE OF FLARE RACING SKYWARD AND BURSTING INTO A BRIGHT STAR LIKE LIGHT DESCENDING BY A PARACHUTE  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GILLIGAN AND THE PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Now lets pray that somebody saw our signal.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL AND THE SKIPPER  MR HOWELL Well if they did I hope they don't come barging in the middle of the night to come rescue us, I'm simply exhausted.  MRS HOWELL Yes we haven't had a decent nights sleep since we got here.  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  SKIPPER Why I don't think any of us has.  The skipper looks over and sees Gilligan asleep again at his post with right hand on his pistol and snoring away.  SKIPPER Except Gilligan. Oh!  The skipper comes up next to Gilligan again.  SKIPPER Gilligan!  Again Gilligan wakes up and immediately pulls his gun as the skipper ducks and fires.  GILLIGAN Halt.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  (CONTINUED) .or I'll.Shoooot.

MARY ANN AND GINGER Good night skipper.  SKIPPER Good night ladies.  The skipper now turns his attention to Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Gilligan how many bullets have you got left in that gun?  GILLIGAN One.  Gilligan fires the gun to show the skipper. Now he has none.  GILLIGAN See.  The skipper is not happy with Gilligan at the moment.  GILLIGAN What did you want to talk to me about skipper?  SKIPPER Gilligan, sentry duty is a sacred trust. You've got to keep a close watch on the weather! If it starts to rain you got to see that the supplies in the hut are kept dry!  GILLIGAN Well you can depend on me skipper.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Most important thing of all, you've got to keep a constant look out for ships!  GILLIGAN Aye, aye sir.  SKIPPER Watch that ocean like a hawk!  Gilligan points out into the jungle.  GILLIGAN Like a hawk sir! If there's a ship out there I'll see it!  SKIPPER If there's a ship out there it's in trouble!  GILLIGAN Huh?  SKIPPER The oceans THIS way!  The skipper points in the direction of the ocean which is opposite of where Gilligan is looking.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Oh. I thought that seaweed looked awful tall.  SKIPPER Gilligan. Are you really wide-awake?  GILLIGAN Wide-awake sir!  SKIPPER No more sleeping on your post?  GILLIGAN No more sleeping sir!  SKIPPER Good man! Now I'll see you in the morning.  GILLIGAN In the morning sir!  SKIPPER Good Night.  GILLIGAN Good night sir!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT  The skipper turns and starts to walk away and leaves Gilligan to resume his sentry duties. He immediately resumes his original position of having his Right hand on the pistol, head cocked to one side and he goes right to sleep.  CUT TO: SHOT OF BUSHES MOVING AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING  We hear a monster like roaring sound coming from the jungle along with the moving bushes.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan wakes up momentarily in response to the sound, looks around, and goes back to sleep as we.   FADE OUT       ACT ONE  FADE IN  STOCK SHOT OF VIEW OF OCEAN THROUGH PALM TREES  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - MORNING - WIDE SHOT  Gilligan is still at his post fast asleep. The skipper is seen coming out of his hut stretching and yawning. He makes his way over to Gilligan and makes a grunting sound to wake Gilligan up. Immediately, Gilligan pulls his pistol and starts firing.  GILLIGAN Halt who goes.friend.or.foe.  The skipper drops to the ground in response. There are no bullets in the gun, so all we hear is the repeated clicks of the hammer.  SKIPPER Ata boy Gilligan. Nice to see that you're still awake at your post.  CUT TO: SAME AREA - NEW ANGLE  GILLIGAN When you told me how important sentry duty was, I didn't shut my eyes the whole night skipper. Not even once! Not even one little teeny weenie.  The skipper grabs the gun from Gilligan.  SKIPPER Oh give me that gun!  GILLIGAN Can I go to bed now huh skipper?  SKIPPER Certainly Gilligan. You've earned a rest.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Thank you sir.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER Right after you've chopped some wood, cooked the breakfast and cleaned up the area, I want you to take a nap and that's an order.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  GILLIGAN Thank you sir.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Now let's get inside and rustle up some breakfast.  The skipper and Gilligan start walking to the supply hut.  CUT TO: CLOSE SHOT NEAR HUT DOOR  Gilligan is the first to enter the supply hut and in doing so lifts some of the thatch roofing that is hanging down over the door way.  CUT TO: INT - SUPPLY HUT - MORNING  He lets go of it just as the skipper starts to enter and hits the skipper in the face.  SKIPPER (SARCASTICALLY) Thanks a lot Gilligan.  The skipper doesn't see the low doorway beam and slams his head into it making him let out a howl.  SKIPPER Awwww.Ooooooo  GILLIGAN Watch your head skipper!  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT OF INTERIOR  As Gilligan looks around the supply hut he notices it's been ransacked. It's in total disarray.  GILLIGAN Hey look.  The skipper and Gilligan look around the hut and inspect a few of the items strewn about.  SKIPPER We been robbed!  GILLIGAN Robbed!?  SKIPPER Somebody broke in here last night!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I think you're right skipper.  SKIPPER Gilligan if you were wide-awake on your post how could somebody get in the hut!?  GILLIGAN I guess they must have picked the lock on the back door!  SKIPPER There is no back door!  GILLIGAN Oh then they came in through the window.  SKIPPER There is no window!  GILLIGAN How 'bout down the chimney?  The skipper is looking sternly at Gilligan.  (CONTINUED) No chimney. (pause) There's no back door, there's no window and there's no chimney. Skipper? Looks like we're up against a pretty clever thief!  SKIPPER Gilligan! Why don't you admit it! You were asleep on guard duty!  GILLIGAN Only during the robbery.  SKIPPER (VERY ANGRY) Ohhhh! Get out of here!  Gilligan makes his way to the door way and stops to lift the thatched roof hanging down.  SKIPPER Well MOVE!!

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN You're right professor.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  GINGER Well it could be an animal.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN You're right Ginger.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR No. Flashlight and a flare gun? Those things are only useful to a man.  MARY ANN Oh if it were a man, we'd have seen him before now.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN You're right Mary Ann.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR It could be someone wanted by the police. An escaped convict or a murderer.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN You're right again professor.  SKIPPER Gilligan will you cut that out! Everyone can't be right!  GILLIGAN Skipper?  SKIPPER What!?  GILLIGAN You're right too.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  GINGER Hey do you really think it was an escaped convict?  MARY ANN Or a murderer!?  PROFESSOR For our own safety, I suggest we start an immediate search.  CUT TO: GROUP SHOT  SKIPPER That's a good idea professor. Come on Gilligan!  The skipper and Gilligan walk off camera.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN AND GINGER  GINGER If we had to get marooned on an island, why didn't we pick Manhattan?  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY - LATER  Gilligan is pouring water from a five gallon Jerry can I to a canteen the skipper is holding.  GILLIGAN Can't I go along with you and the professor on the manhunt?  SKIPPER No Gilligan I want you to stay here with Mr. Howell and guard the women.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON SKIPPER  SKIPPER Most of all we've got to get that flare gun back!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Well you be careful huh skipper? Cause if it is an escaped convict or a vicious killer, he might be dangerous.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON SKIPPER  SKIPPER Just between us Gilligan, I hope it's only a vicious killer or an escaped convict. I'm afraid it's something much worse.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Something much worse!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON SKIPPER  SKIPPER (SOTTO) Yes I think its voodoo.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Voodoo!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) Shhhhhhh! Lets not upset the women!  GILLIGAN Lets not upset the men either!  SKIPPER There's some weird and fantastic things have been going on in these waters Gilligan. For which there's only one explanation.  GILLIGAN Voodoo!?  SKIPPER Voodoo.  Gilligan is really starting to get spooked.  SKIPPER Think of it, ever since we got to this island, we've had nothing but bad luck. One disaster after another. What do you think caused it?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I thought we all agreed it was me!   CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON SKIPPER  SKIPPER No Gilligan, voodoo.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Oh!  Gilligan is filling up a gourd the skipper has as the skipper tells his tale.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Now some people think it's a silly superstition, but I've heard tell of witch doctors in these parts can turn people into Hyenas, and baboons and all kinds of wild jungle animals.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER'S SHOE GETTING WET  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON SKIPPER  Gilligan is so entrenched by the skipper's story; he doesn't stop filling the gourd even after it's filled up. The water spills out all over the skipper tennis shoes.  (CONTINUED) Gilligan, I think my shoe is full now.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON GILLIGAN  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Oh sorry sir.  SKIPPER Thank you very much.  The skipper continues his tale.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - ANGLE ON SKIPPER  SKIPPER Evil spirits are spawned in these waters Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER And they cast their black spell, over all those who invade their domain!  The professor walks on camera from behind.  PROFESSOR Ready skipper.  The professor startles the skipper and Gilligan and they both let out a horrible cry.  (CONTINUED) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.  GILLIGAN That's all right I was scared already.  SKIPPER I.I think we better be going professor.  PROFESSOR Right.  The skipper takes out a gun with a rabbit's foot hanging from it and hands them to Gilligan.  SKIPPER Ah Gilligan, I'm leaving these things with you. A gun and a rabbit's foot. One doesn't work, use the other. Come on professor.  The skipper and professor walk off camera leaving Gilligan alone.  GILLIGAN But skipper!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  The skipper and professor turn around after hearing Gilligan.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN We don't have any bullets for this gun!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  SKIPPER Well you know that and I know that but the killer won't know it!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan's face shows a sense of defeat.  FADE: TO: EXT - LAGOON AREA - DAY  Ginger is sitting near the lagoon fixing her hair and singing to herself.  GINGER .I'm all a glow.  Mary Ann runs on camera in a desperate state.   MARY ANN Golly Ginger am I scared! I've never been so frightened in my whole life!  Ginger, still fixing her hair doesn't seem at all aware of the danger.  GINGER Neither have I.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN Just think, there may be some strange man loose on this island!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER That's what I am thinking. Honey would you hand me my compact please?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN What compact?  CUT TO: SHOT OF MARY ANN AND GINGER  Ginger points to where the compact is.  GINGER There.  Mary Ann bends down and picks up the compact for Ginger.  MARY ANN Clamshell?  GINGER Yeah, cute huh? I made it myself.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER I had to have something to put my make-up in.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  GINGER There's nothing in there but berries!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER That's right. The red berries are lipstick, the blue berries are shadow and the black berries are mascara.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN Oh honestly Ginger! You don't seem the least bit worried!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER What's there to worry about?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  MARY ANN Well suppose the man they're looking for turns out to be a killer!?  CUT TO: SHOT OF MARY ANN AND GINGER  GINGER Honey, if the man they're looking for turns out to be a man, he can do the worrying.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  Mary Ann is left with a worried looks on her face as we.  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is seen working on some kind of trap made from sticks and vines. He's pulling down on a rope and trying to attach it to the sticks. Ginger is seen walking on camera followed by Mary Ann who is running straight for Gilligan's trap.  MARY ANN Hi Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Stop stop!  MARY ANN Well what are you doing!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I just set a trap for the prowler.  GINGER (O.S.) (SEDUCTIVELY) So did I.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER (SEDUCTIVELY) How does yours work?  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  GILLIGAN When he comes down the trail to the supply hut, his foot hits the stick, goes into the loop and tchoooo!

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is placing leaves over the trap to hide it.  GILLIGAN Please stop asking so many questions huh? You'll both feel a lot safer if you just think there's a dangerous killer loose on the island.  Gilligan makes a grimacing face, as he knows he let the cat out of the bag.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  Ginger has a confused look on her face.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  Mary Ann looks at Ginger with the same confused look.

FADE TO: INT - MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT - DAY  The Howell's are in their hut doing some work.  MR HOWELL Well, that does it Lovey! Surly bit of construction if I say so myself.  MRS HOWELL Thurston what on earth is that on your forehead?  Mr. Howell wipes his forehead and looks at his hand.  MR HOWELL Ah.looks like water, a.wonder where it came from?  MRS HOWELL Thurston I know what it is! I use to see it on our gardener! It's perspiration!  MR HOWELL It IS!? What can I put it in? I've got to send it to dad, he'd be fascinated!  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Mr. And Mrs. Howell!  MRS HOWELL Dear, I do wish people wouldn't drop by without letting us know they're coming.  MR HOWELL It's only Gilligan Lovey.  MRS HOWELL Yes I know, but everything is in such a mess. The place looks like a hut!  MR HOWELL Yes it is a rather crude cab anion.  Gilligan makes it to the Howell's hut.  (CONTINUED) Come in, come in boy!  GILLIGAN I just thought I'd check on you folks.hey what's that?  MRS HOWELL Well, we thought with the prowler in the neighborhood, we better not take any chances.

CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE  - DAY  Gilligan is walking along looking for the skipper.  GILLIGAN Skipper!? Skipper where are you!?  SKIPPER (O.S.) Over here Gilligan.  Gilligan continues to hunt for the skipper. As Gilligan is searching we see the skipper comfortably hanging upside down from Gilligan's trap.  GILLIGAN Where?  SKIPPER Right here Gilligan.  Gilligan looks up and sees the skipper.  GILLIGAN I see you found my trap.  SKIPPER Yes I did.  GILLIGAN Works pretty good huh?  SKIPPER Works fine. Works just fine.  GILLIGAN Oh good it had me pretty worried. I didn't think it was going to work at all.  SKIPPER Oh you don't have to worry about the trap Gilligan. You don't have to worry about anything.

SKIPPER Now Gilligan what ever it was that attacked you is gone.  PAN LEFT WITH SKIPPER, PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN No no!  We see that the commotion has awakened the rest of the castaways who are now out side the hut watching.  PROFESSOR You must have been dreaming.  GILLIGAN No no no no dreaming!  SKIPPER Gilligan get a hold.  Gilligan has panicked and is trying to get the professor and the skipper to believe him. He starts to rant and rave about his experience. He starts to re-enact the encounter in a frenzied manner.  SKIPPER Tell us!  GILLIGAN All of a sudden.all of a sudden a monster, eight feet tall came out of nowhere and he attacked me!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is making wild gestures to illustrate his experience.  (CONTINUED) An he.and he had long arms, and claws and big yellow teeth!

They never saw the sailor again but, the next day in his hammock they found a Parrot. The Parrot kept saying over and over again, five three three nine nine three. That was the sailor's serial number. Well I'm through now.  GILLIGAN I think I'm through too!  Gilligan is so frightened by the skipper's story that he faints to the ground and the skipper the professor try to catch him.  SKIPPER Gilligan!   FADE OUT      ACT TWO  FADE IN  STOCK SHOT OF PALM TREES  Gilligan and the professor are walking through the jungle in search of the monster. Gilligan is visibly worried.  GILLIGAN Professor? It's getting kind of late. Why don't we call off the search and go back to camp?  PROFESSOR Because the flare gun is our only chance to be rescued. Gilligan, only a coward would quit at a time like this.  GILLIGAN Oh. Well would it be all right for the cowards to quit and go back to camp?  PROFESSOR All this talk about voodoo and witchcraft is ridiculous. What ever you saw last night, there is a simple logical explanation for it.  GILLIGAN Probably nothing more than a monster.  PROFESSOR Gilligan there is no such thing as a monster, will you believe that.  GILLIGAN I'll try sir.  PROFESSOR I know what I'm talking about. The only place you'll ever find a monster is in your mind.  GILLIGAN And in the supply hut.  PROFESSOR You know I think we can cover more ground if we split up. I'll go this way and you go that way.  GILLIGAN Wo.wo.wait a minute professor. Wa.why don't we just stay together and kind of go this way?  PROFESSOR Gilligan, you're suffering from anxieties activated in your subconscious by a traumatic experience last night, resulting in withdrawal syndromes. Do you know what means?  GILLIGAN I'm chicken.  PROFESSOR You see what's off in that direction and I'll meet you back at camp.  The professor walks off camera as Gilligan is left standing alone in the jungle. Gilligan has a last second question and turns to talk to the professor who is no longer there.  GILLIGAN Oh wait a min.n.n.n  Gilligan, now alone, starts walking through the jungle. He's not sure where he's at, and then suddenly he loses his footing and trips.

Ginger is carrying a fan and is fanning herself.  GINGER What's the big blaze about skipper, it's hot enough.  SKIPPER Nothing like a good fire to keep the bugs away.  MARY ANN Bug?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER Mosquitoes, moths, zombies, vampires.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER AND MARY ANN  MARY ANN I saw a picture called the land of the vampires once, and they didn't build a fire to chase away the monsters, they hung out pieces of Wolf Bain.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER Wolf Bain!? That's Hollywood for you. Any fool knows that Wolf Bain is only used against Werewolves.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER AND MARY ANN  MARY ANN It was a very good picture!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER  SKIPPER Maybe so, but a glaring mistake like that makes the whole picture unbelievable.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER AND MARY ANN  MARY ANN I guess you're right skipper. Gee you were in the land of the vampires weren't you Ginger?  GINGER No, I was up for a part. But I was the wrong blood type.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP  We see the professor emerge from the jungle and make his way over to the others.  PROFESSOR Hi!  GINGER Hi.  SKIPPER Hi professor!

If you're more comfortable that way.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND CHIMP  (CONTINUED) Gilligan, I know it's going to be hard for you to a.adjust to this new way of life. But if you're half the man that I think you are, I know you'll come through with flying colors. Awe I just can't bare to see you in those clothes.  The skipper starts to take off Gilligan's clothes from the chimp.  SKIPPER Gilligan, you know, besides the fact that these clothes you won't need'em, in this condition! We'll give up the sea.  CUT TO: MR HOWELL, GINGER, THE PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN MEDIUM SHOT  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The Chimp starts making loud screeching noises and is getting impatient.

Episode #31, “Diogenes, Won’t You Please Go Home?” The other castaways become suspicious of Gilligan when they discover that he's been keeping a diary, and they respond by creating their own written accounts of how they saved Gilligan from the Japanese sailor.  “Diogenes, Won’t You Please Go Home?”  By  David P. Harmon  May 1, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan walks through the jungle, followed by Skipper. Skipper follows Gilligan, peeking through the brush. INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Gilligan enters the hut and closes the door behind him. SKIPPER (O.C.) Gilligan? Where are you? Gilligan walks to a planter, removes a fern, takes something from beneath the pot, and replaces the fern. Gilligan walks over to a cabinet on the opposite wall. SKIPPER (O.C.) (cont'd) Gilligan? Gilligan? Gilligan opens the cabinet door, puts something in it, closed the door, and places a lock on the door. Skipper enters the hut and Gilligan quickly turns around. SKIPPER Gilligan, where are you? Skipper sees Gilligan and walks over to him. SKIPPER (cont'd) Didn't you hear me call you, little buddy? GILLIGAN Uh-huh. SKIPPER And what did you lock up in the cabinet? GILLIGAN Nothing. SKIPPER Gilligan, how can you lock up nothing? GILLIGAN It's pretty hard. You have to get a grip on it, get your legs apart and give it a good -- SKIPPER I see. In other words, you don't want to tell me. GILLIGAN Yup. SKIPPER Gilligan, I'll tell you something. I'm not interested. FLIP TO: INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Gilligan sleeps in his hammock. Skipper sneaks in the hut by opening the door quietly and tip-toeing over to the cabinet. Skipper tries the lock. Gilligan, who wasn't actually sleeping, looks at Skipper from beneath his hat. Gilligan pulls his hat up slightly to reveal his eyes. Gilligan rests his head on his hand. GILLIGAN (whispering) The key's on top of the cupboard. SKIPPER (whispering) Thanks, Gilligan. Skipper reaches up to the top of the cabinet, takes the key, and opens the lock. Skipper removes the lock, and then realizes Gilligan is awake and sees what he's doing. Skipper turns around and looks at Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) That wasn't very funny. GILLIGAN I was just trying to be helpful. Skipper opens the cabinet door and finds nothing inside. SKIPPER It's empty. GILLIGAN Right. SKIPPER Absolutely nothing. Gilligan grins and nods. GILLIGAN But there used to be something. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY GILLIGAN as he walks through the jungle, looking behind to see if he was followed. He walks over to a tree with a hole near the root, kneels down, and reaches in. SKIPPER (O.S.) A-ha! Gilligan looks up and sees the Skipper sitting up in the tree. GILLIGAN A-ha? PAN UP TO SKIPPER SKIPPER A-ha. GILLIGAN GILLIGAN Skipper, what are you doing up there? BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER Gilligan, what is more important is what are you doing down there? GILLIGAN Skipper, if I were you, I'd get out of that tree. SKIPPER Gilligan, I am not moving until I have learned your little secret. GILLIGAN It's no secret. See? Gilligan holds up a small piece of honeycomb. SKIPPER And what is that, may I ask? GILLIGAN It's honey. I got a sweet tooth and every once in a while I reach in and pull out a piece of honeycomb. SKIPPER Gilligan, don't you know better than to stick your hand in a beehive? GILLIGAN It's not dangerous. The honey drips through the hole and the bees come in and out by your -- BEEHIVE Bees buzz around Skipper. SKIPPER That is the silliest thing I have ever heard! Skipper falls from the tree to the ground next to Gilligan. Gilligan rises to his knees and crawls over to Skipper. GILLIGAN See? See? I told you so. Skipper swats at bees. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Ginger sits up from her chaise lounge chair. Mary Ann sits across from her. GINGER Could it be a black pearl? MARY ANN That's possible. That's very possible. GINGER I bet that he's got a whole bagful and he's not sharing them with us. MARY ANN Oh, Ginger. Gilligan wouldn't do a thing like that. He's our friend. GINGER A girl's best friend is a -- MATCH CUT TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper sits on his hammock. Professor paces the floor. SKIPPER Diamond? PROFESSOR Geologically impossible. SKIPPER A ruby? PROFESSOR Southeast Asia. SKIPPER An emerald? PROFESSOR India and the China coast. Skipper stands up. SKIPPER Professor, what is it that Gilligan has that's fabulously valuable that fits in a space like this? Skipper places his hands apart, measuring something the size of a breadbox. MATCH CUT TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Mr. Howell places his hands apart, measuring something the size of a bottle of Scotch. Mrs. Howell files her nails. MR HOWELL An eight-year-old bottle of Scotch. MRS HOWELL Thurston, we haven't been on this island for eight years. MR HOWELL A five-year-old bottle of Scotch? MRS HOWELL What makes you think, darling, that he's hiding liquid refreshments? MR HOWELL It's the Howell instinct, my dear. You mark my words. Gilligan is fermenting the juice of the grape! EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan carries a pile of coconuts through the jungle. He trips and spills the coconuts on the ground. He picks them up and reaches to get one that rolled into a bush. GINGER Oh! Gilligan is startled and stands up. Ginger appears out of the bush. GILLIGAN Ginger, what are you doing in there? GINGER In where? GILLIGAN In that bush. GINGER In the bush? I -- I -- I was looking for something. GILLIGAN A bird? GINGER Yeah. GILLIGAN Are you a bird-watcher? GINGER I was looking for a bird. GILLIGAN Me, too. Today I saw a turquoise-browed mott mott and a European poo poo. GINGER It must have been fun. GILLIGAN What kind are you looking for? GINGER Baltimore oriole. GILLIGAN That's a baseball player. GINGER (sultry) Yeah. Ginger turns and walks up the jungle path. Gilligan tries to figure out what she meant. He shakes his head. FLIP TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Gilligan sweeps the hut. Professor enters. PROFESSOR Ah, Gilligan, I've been looking for you. GILLIGAN Well, I'm sure not hard to find. PROFESSOR What do you mean? GILLIGAN Everybody's been finding me. Been up in trees and jumping out of bushes and just peeking all over the place. Gilligan pulls back the curtain on the closet to reveal Mary Ann standing in it. Gilligan hands her the broom. He closes the curtain. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Thanks, Mary Ann. (to Professor) See what I mean? Gilligan opens the curtain again. Mary Ann emerges from the closet and takes the broom with her. MARY ANN I just need the broom for spring house cleaning. GILLIGAN What, in November? Mary Ann exits the hut. PROFESSOR Gilligan, it should be obvious. You've hidden something valuable and the other people think you ought to share it with them. GILLIGAN What's valuable about a diary? PROFESSOR A what? GILLIGAN My diary. I write down things about the people and what happens on the island. I call it "Dear Diary." PROFESSOR And you've been keeping it hidden? GILLIGAN Uh-huh. I hid it real good. PROFESSOR Are you sure? GILLIGAN I'm positive, because I forgot where I hid it. PROFESSOR Wait till I tell the others. Professor turns and exits the hut. Gilligan turns to pick something up and "Dear Diary" is in his back pocket. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper, Mr. Howell, and Ginger sit at the dining table while Professor stands. PROFESSOR And that's the valuable possession that Gilligan's been hiding. SKIPPER And here I thought it was something worth a fortune, like a rare jewel or something. GINGER I thought it was a bag of black pearls. MR HOWELL I knew what he was hiding. You can't fool old Thurston Howell the Third. SKIPPER You thought it was a bottle of Scotch. GINGER There's a great difference between a bottle of Scotch and a diary. MR HOWELL Not to Dean Martin. Fast one. PROFESSOR Anyway, the mystery's solved. Gilligan has merely been keeping a diary of our life here on the island. (pause) So, now we can all relax. Professor pats Skipper on the back and exits. SKIPPER SKIPPER (V.O.) Hey, wait a minute. I wonder what Gilligan wrote about me? GINGER GINGER (V.O.) Oh, my gosh. I've got to read what he wrote. MR. HOWELL MR HOWELL (V.O.) Good heavens, will he defame the Howell name? BACK TO SCENE DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAGOON - DAY Gilligan fishes from a large rock by the edge of lagoon. Skipper walks down the hill and walks up to Gilligan. SKIPPER Hi, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. SKIPPER Fish biting good? GILLIGAN No, not so good. SKIPPER You know what I'm gonna do after we get rescued? GILLIGAN Uh-uh, what? SKIPPER I'm gonna get myself a new ship, and guess who's gonna be my first mate? GILLIGAN Skinny Dave Davis? SKIPPER Guess again. GILLIGAN Fatso Mulligan? SKIPPER No, you. GILLIGAN Me? SKIPPER Of course, if people say bad things about me, well, nobody would give me a ship, would they? GILLIGAN Who would say bad things about you? SKIPPER Of course if they said I was to blame for the wreck or that I was a bad officer or couldn't handle men, people could say those things. GILLIGAN Yeah, I guess they could. SKIPPER In that case, could I have just a wee peek? Just a little peek at your diary? GILLIGAN No, I couldn't do that. SKIPPER Gilligan, not even where I'm mentioned? Gilligan, as your skipper, I demand it. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Skipper, but it's private. SKIPPER Hand me that diary, and that's an order! GILLIGAN What if I say no? SKIPPER I'll have you put in irons. GILLIGAN Oh. I thought you were gonna make me walk the plank. SKIPPER First you'll walk the plank, then I'll have you keelhauled, then I'll have you drawn and quartered. GILLIGAN Skipper? SKIPPER What? GILLIGAN How do you spell quartered? SKIPPER Cue-you-ay-ar-tee-e-ar-e-dee. (pleasantly) Good fishing, little buddy. FLIP TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Ginger approaches Gilligan seductively. GILLIGAN I can't. GINGER Gilligan, you don't understand. GILLIGAN I'd like to show you my diary, but I can't. GINGER I thought that you liked me. GILLIGAN I do. GINGER Well, don't you want me to be the most famous movie star in the whole world? GILLIGAN Sure. GINGER Then show me your diary, and I'll take it to Hollywood and they'll make a big motion picture about it. GILLIGAN They will? GINGER Uh-huh. Don't you wanna be my co-star? GILLIGAN Me, in the movies? Ginger inches forward. GINGER Sure. We'll have lots of scenes together. (sultry) Kissing scenes. GILLIGAN (bashfully) And hugging? GINGER (sultry) Uh-huh. And we'll rehearse over, and over, and over. Gilligan turns away, hits the side of his head on the pole supporting the hammocks, stuns himself, and slides down to the ground. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan sits while Mr. Howell stands before him. MR HOWELL I, Thurston Howell the Third, creator of careers, builder of men's minds, shaper of their souls, I hereby do take over. GILLIGAN Don't think I don't appreciate what you're saying, Mister Howell. It's just that I don't understand it. MR HOWELL Leave the thinking to me, see. Hand the diary over to me, my boy, and I'll publish it. I'll make you toast to the literary world, an author (French) par excellence. GILLIGAN But you'd read it. MR HOWELL Well, yes, as publisher, it would be my duty to, of course -- GILLIGAN I couldn't let you do that. MR HOWELL But I'm not just an ordinary man. I'm an outstanding citizen in the community, a man known for his compassion, for his consideration -- GILLIGAN Mister Howell -- MR HOWELL (scolding) Will you be quiet? (pause) A man known for his courtesy and thoughtfulness to his fellow man. GILLIGAN But Mister Howell -- MR HOWELL (yells) Shut up! GILLIGAN Mister Howell, I'm sorry, it's private.

MR HOWELL Large bee e ay ess tee -- Mr. Howell laughs. Gilligan nods. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan stands at the edge of the water. GILLIGAN (to Dear Diary) Don't expect me to write in you tonight, because you're not gonna be here. You've caused me enough trouble, and you're not gonna cause me anymore. Gilligan hurls the book toward the lagoon. The other castaways appear from the jungle underbrush. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hey, Skipper, did you see that? I threw it right in the lagoon. Hey, Ginger, how about that? It was my high, hard, fast one. Pow! I bet it went a mile, huh? Mister Howell, did you -- Professor -- Gilligan frowns. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan reclines on the large fallen tree trunk. He plays with the bayonet as Mrs. Howell emerges from the jungle. It appears that he might puncture his belly with it. MRS HOWELL Oh, Gilligan, don't do that. GILLIGAN Don't do what? MRS HOWELL Ooh, commit Larry-Harry or Harry-Larry or whatever they do with those dreadful things. GILLIGAN Oh, I wouldn't do a thing like that, Missus Howell. All I was doing was just looking at the bayonet -- (pause) You're talking to me. MRS HOWELL Of course I am. I talk to everybody but I have a feeling sometimes that nobody listens. GILLIGAN I wanna talk to them long enough to find out why they're mad at me. MRS HOWELL Oh, that. Thurston explained that to me all last night. GILLIGAN What'd he say? MRS HOWELL Well, it has something to do with your diary. How did he put it? (pause) Oh, "that nasty habit you have of always telling the truth." GILLIGAN All I did was write down what happened. I didn't make anything up. MRS HOWELL Well, that's probably why it's the truth. GILLIGAN I bet you wouldn't be mad at me because of my diary. I wrote, "I look on you like a mother." MRS HOWELL Ah, Gilligan, that's sweet of you, but I don't think I'll mention it to Thurston. GILLIGAN Why not? MRS HOWELL Well, I have an idea that he would rather not be considered your father. Mrs. Howell exits. GILLIGAN I wish they'd all write their own diaries and maybe they'd stop being mad at me. Gilligan leans back and plays with the bayonet. DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Gilligan enters the hut. Skipper sits at a table, wielding his pen and writing on one page of a stack of papers. Gilligan leans up against the center pole of the hut and whittles a piece of bamboo with the bayonet. SKIPPER What are you doing, Gilligan? GILLIGAN Whittling. SKIPPER Must you whittle? GILLIGAN I won't do it if it bothers you. SKIPPER It bothers me. Gilligan tosses the bamboo aside. Gilligan sits down at the table opposite Skipper. He looks at the bayonet blade momentarily and then tosses it into the ground. Gilligan picks the blade up. SKIPPER (cont'd) And now? GILLIGAN Mumblety-peg. SKIPPER Gilligan, give me that. Gilligan hands the bayonet to Skipper. Skipper places it down on the table next to him. SKIPPER (cont'd) Bayonet. GILLIGAN It's the bayonet we took off that Japanese sailor, remember? He didn't know the war was over and took them all prisoner. SKIPPER Of course I remember. GILLIGAN They were all locked up in the compound and I rescued them. SKIPPER You rescued them? GILLIGAN Sure. Don't you remember? He was up, sleeping on the crotch of that tree, and I crept up and took the key around his neck. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: DREAM SEQUENCE - EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY GILLIGAN Skipper, how're you doing? Skipper shushes him. SKIPPER Don't bother me. I'm doing fine. PAN ON Gilligan walks to the women's cell. GILLIGAN Hi, girls. Here, hold this, will you? Gilligan leans the machine gun on the cell near Mary Ann. Gilligan unlocks the women's cell. The women escape. Mary Ann drags the machine gun. Gilligan goes to the men's cell and unlocks it. They escape. The castaways gather behind Skipper as he digs. Gilligan hands Skipper the bayonet. HIGH ANGLE ON SKIPPER GILLIGAN (cont'd) Here you are, Skipper, use this. It might go a little faster. SKIPPER Thanks, Gilligan. SKIPPER sees that he's surrounded by feet and that Gilligan has freed the other castaways. Skipper gives an aside glance. END DREAM SEQUENCE. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper and Gilligan sit across the table from each other. SKIPPER Gilligan, I have never heard a more weird fabrication. GILLIGAN You like the way I told it? SKIPPER Gilligan, I have just written our experience with that Japanese sailor in my diary. GILLIGAN Your diary? SKIPPER Yes. So that the whole world will know the truth after we're rescued. In these pages, Gilligan, is exactly what happened. Why, if it hadn't been for my heroic feats, you wouldn't even be here. GILLIGAN I wouldn't? SKIPPER Now hear this. Skipper reads the pages he's written. Gilligan listens intently. SKIPPER (cont'd) "One by one, my fellow castaways disappeared. In spite of my warnings that there was danger afoot, they wandered off, only to be captured by the enemy. I found myself all alone, except for Gilligan." RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: DREAM SEQUENCE - EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan stands behind a small tree trunk. He looks fearful. Skipper passes Gilligan on the path and stops. SKIPPER What's the matter, boy? GILLIGAN Oh, sir, all of our friends are captured. SKIPPER I'm aware of that. GILLIGAN A Japanese sailor is going to kill them. SKIPPER Kill them? Ha! Not while I have the use of these two arms. GILLIGAN Sir -- Skipper raises his arms and flexes one bicep and then the other, and finally both at the same time. GILLIGAN (cont'd) He has guns and things, and all you have is your bare hands. SKIPPER Gilligan, I order you to stay here. I shall go forth and free our friends, then turn my mind to the enemy. GILLIGAN But what if you are captured? SKIPPER You shall never know that, lad, for you will hear nothing but my steady breathing throughout his tortures. GILLIGAN Oh, sir. Patriotic MUSIC plays. Skipper moves Gilligan over a few inches to hide him behind a rather narrow tree trunk. Skipper exits to save the passengers. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY GINGER Skipper, we're doomed. MARY ANN I'm too young to die. MRS HOWELL If I could just see my darling Thurston once more. SKIPPER Trust me, madam, to see to it that you and your husband are soon reunited. Skipper grasps the bamboo bars of the cell. A grenade drops to Skipper's feet. SKIPPER (cont'd) Oh. A live hand grenade. Stand back, ladies. Sometimes the shrapnel comes through my fingers when the grenade goes off. SKIPPERS HANDS grasp the grenade and it explodes! Dust shoots out between his fingers. PULL BACK TO SCENE GINGER Skipper, what a brave and dangerous thing you've done. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY Gilligan is stretched out, bound by his limbs to bamboo stakes. Japanese Sailor holds a small cup of water. JAPANESE SAILOR Now it's time for famous Japanese water torture. GILLIGAN I thought it was a Chinese water torture. JAPANESE SAILOR They just copied from Japan! You know, I got a good mind not to torture you, but I got to. I have many questions yet to ask for you to answer. All right, now. Dlop by dlop. Japanese Sailor pours the entire content of the cup onto Gilligan's face. Gilligan sputters the water out of his mouth. GILLIGAN That's a mighty big dlop. JAPANESE SAILOR That's only first dlop. SKIPPER No, you don't. Not as long as I'm alive you don't even get name or serial number. Japanese Sailor turns and walks to the tree behind him, where he has a machine gun. He picks up the machine gun and points it at Skipper. GILLIGAN Skipper, you have come to save me. JAPANESE SAILOR Nothing can save you or him. Skipper slowly charges Japanese Sailor, as if Skipper were Frankenstein's monster. Skipper takes the machine gun from Japanese Sailor. He grasps the bullet magazine and crushes it with his bare hand and throws it away. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) Holy mackerel! Skipper tears off the gun sight and the gun's barrel and tosses that over his shoulder. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) That's not nice. Oh, please don't -- Skipper folds the rest of the machine gun into a lump of twisted metal and tosses that over his shoulder too. END DREAM SEQUENCE. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - DAY Skipper and Gilligan sit across the table from each other. Gilligan leans on his hand, looking bored. SKIPPER And that, Gilligan, is actually what happened. Gilligan perks up. GILLIGAN It is? SKIPPER Of course I have omitted some of the parts where I acted far and above the call of duty. But then all officers do. GILLIGAN Uh-huh, yeah. SKIPPER Now, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, I have more that I want to write. GILLIGAN Okay. Skipper. Gilligan rises and walks to the door, but is stopped by Skipper. SKIPPER Uh, Gilligan? Your bayonet. Skipper picks up the bayonet, turns it so the handle is toward Gilligan, and hands it to Gilligan. Gilligan takes the bayonet. DISSOLVE TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Gilligan faces the door, but turns around. Gilligan holds the bayonet. Mr. Howell sits at his desk, pen in hand, with papers he's written sitting in front of him. Mr. Howell writes with a feathered quill. An inkwell sits on the table. GILLIGAN I know, Mister Howell, I'm just mixed up. MR HOWELL Not an unusual state, I might add. GILLIGAN I was telling the Skipper about the time when the Japanese sailor was here on the island, and he remembers everything different. MR HOWELL Well, fortunately, we don't have to depend on memory. You see, I jotted it all down in my journal. GILLIGAN You did? What happened to me? MR HOWELL You were shot! Gilligan is startled. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Oh, no. That's the wrong page. Mr. Howell laughs. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Now, let's see, "Menace stalked our tiny little island. Despite all my efforts to protect them, the women were captured and I did the only thing I could. I allowed myself to be captured, too." RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: DREAM SEQUENCE - EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY Mr. Howell is locked in the men's cell by the Japanese Sailor. PROFESSOR Mister Howell, I never thought he could outwit you. MR HOWELL A ruse, a clever device on my part, my boy. PROFESSOR Getting captured? MR HOWELL Very few men would've thought about it. PROFESSOR But how do we escape now? Mr. Howell arrogantly laughs. Mr. Howell removes his shoe. MR HOWELL You just leave everything to me, huh? Mr. Howell pulls at the sole and turns away. He motions that he's pulling something rather large from his shoe. He puts his shoe back on. Then he turns back to reveal a shovel. PROFESSOR How did you ever do that? MR HOWELL Top secret, my boy, top secret. Keep an eye open. I must rescue everyone. Mr. Howell digs in the sand with the shovel. Professor keeps watch. MR. HOWELL digs in fast motion. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY Gilligan is backed up against a rock wall with his arms over his head. JAPANESE SAILOR It's time for execution. GILLIGAN Please, I'm just a young, innocent boy. JAPANESE SAILOR Age make no difference. It's time for execution. GILLIGAN I'm stalling for time, so I can be rescued by one of my brave friends. JAPANESE SAILOR It's one big laugh. Japanese Sailor laughs. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) And a double laugh. Ha ha. Japanese Sailor moves in front of Gilligan. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) All right, now. Don't move! Japanese Sailor raises his rifle to execute Gilligan firing squad style. JAPANESE SAILOR (cont'd) All right! A whip appears out of nowhere and pulls the gun out of Japanese Sailor's hands. Mr. Howell pulls the rifle to him. GILLIGAN I am saved. Gilligan puts his arms down. JAPANESE SAILOR Ah-so. We see who's saved. MR HOWELL Never fear, Gilligan. Thurston is here. Mr. Howell slings the whip at the Japanese Sailor. The whip surrounds Japanese Sailor. Mr. Howell pulls Japanese Sailor over to him. They dance a rumba-like dance to MUSIC. Gilligan watches them dance. Mr. Howell finally flings the whip behind him. EXT. LAGOON - DAY The Japanese Sailor flies through the air into the lagoon, making a cannonball-like splash. EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY Mr. Howells runs to Gilligan at the rock wall. GILLIGAN Oh, sir, thank you. Gilligan kisses the shoulders of Mr. Howell in thanks, as he would to greet a European. MR HOWELL Come, let us set the others free. No need to worry them, my boy. Mr. Howell arrogantly laughs. END DREAM SEQUENCE. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Gilligan reads the pages over Mr. Howell's shoulder. MR HOWELL I'm sure you remember now, hmmm? GILLIGAN You and the Skipper sure don't agree. Gilligan stands upright. MR HOWELL That doesn't matter to me. What is important is I recorded the whole thing for posterity. GILLIGAN Thanks for remembering for me. MR HOWELL That's all right, Gilligan. Anytime at all, feel free to call on me. GILLIGAN Right. Gilligan turns to exit. EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan exits the Howells hut and walks to the dining table where Ginger is seated. She has a small notebook in front of her and a pen in her hand. GILLIGAN Ginger? GINGER Yeah. GILLIGAN Can I bother you for a minute? Gilligan sits down. GINGER Of course. GILLIGAN Do you remember when the Japanese sailor was here on the island? GINGER The Japanese sailor? GILLIGAN Yeah. Ginger thinks for a moment. GINGER Oh, that's reel five. Ginger flips through the pages. GILLIGAN You were rescued. GINGER No. No, I rescued you. GILLIGAN (sarcastically) Oh, you remember it, too. Gilligan rests his head on his arm. GINGER You see, you were tied to a tree and I came through the jungle. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: DREAM SEQUENCE - EXT. JAPANESE SAILOR COMPOUND - DAY Gilligan is tied to a tree with many loops of thick rope. The Japanese Sailor points his rifle at Gilligan. GILLIGAN You know, Japanese sailor, sir, I'm not the only one here on the island. JAPANESE SAILOR Ah, but others are captured, too. So now I shoot you. GILLIGAN One will get free and rescue me, because that's the American way. Ginger appears from behind the tree. GINGER I will save you, Gilligan. JAPANESE SAILOR It's American movie star. It's come for the rescue, huh? Oh, that's ridiculous. GINGER You think I'm just a movie star, don't you? GILLIGAN You mean, behind that greasepaint there's something we don't know about? GINGER I'm Secret Agent thirty-seven twenty-five thirty-six. JAPANESE SAILOR Thirty-seven twenty-five thirty-six? Oh, mama-san, that's no secret. GINGER I am a judo expert. JAPANESE SAILOR And I'm good-rooking. Ha! You judo expert? All right, rots of ruck. GINGER Holder of the black belt. GILLIGAN Hurray! Ginger reaches into the crotch of the tree and removes a judo robe. JAPANESE SAILOR What the -- Ginger puts the robe on. Gilligan, though loosely tied to the tree, lends a hand and assists Ginger in putting on the robe. GINGER Thank you, Gilligan. The Japanese Sailor helps Ginger adjust the robe too. The Japanese Sailor hands his rifle to Gilligan. GINGER (cont'd) (French) En garde. The Japanese Sailor mutters faux Japanese and lunges at Ginger. SERIES OF SHOTS IN FAST MOTION Ginger, now barefoot, tosses Japanese Sailor on the ground. Gilligan winces in sympathetic pain. The Japanese Sailor kicks at Ginger. She parries and throws him to the ground. Gilligan winces. Ginger coifs her hair. Japanese Sailor jumps to his feet and struggles with Ginger. Ginger tosses him to the ground with a THUD. Gilligan winces in sympathy. Japanese Sailor rises to his fit, throws a judo-punch, which Ginger dodges, and she tosses him face-first to the ground. He rises to his knees and Ginger gives him a karate-chop to his back, laying him out. BACK TO SCENE GINGER (cont'd) So much for him. GILLIGAN Ginger, I mean, thirty-seven twenty-five thirty-six, you were great. Ginger puts her shoes back on. GINGER Oh, thanks, Gilligan. GINGER (cont'd) I've got to free the others. I shall return. Ginger disappears behind the tree to which Gilligan is still tied. END DREAM SEQUENCE. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Still seated at the camp dining table with Ginger, Gilligan listens to Ginger's version of the Japanese Sailor rescue story. He rests is head on both hands, one cheek on each. GILLIGAN And after you ran off into the jungle, how did I get out of the tree? GINGER I haven't gotten to that part yet, Gilligan. Come back in an hour. I'll have it for you. GILLIGAN Okay, Ginger. Thanks a lot, Ginger. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann runs from the jungle to the dining table. Professor and Ginger sit at the dining table. Ginger eats a banana. Mr. Howell and Skipper sit at a small table outside the boys hut. Mrs. Howell stands near them. MARY ANN Everybody, look. I found it! I found it! PROFESSOR What? MARY ANN Well, Gilligan's diary. GINGER It can't be. I saw him throw it in the lagoon. MARY ANN Well, the tide must have washed it back. Mr. Howell, Mrs. Howell, and Skipper walk over to the dining table. MR HOWELL Let's hear what that miserable wretch has to say about this. SKIPPER Hear that, too. MRS HOWELL I think you'd better read it, dear. MARY ANN All right, just listen to this, Mister Howell. MARY ANN reads Gilligan's diary. MARY ANN (cont'd) "I'm on the island with Mr. Thurston Howell the Third. I don't have to say who he is... MR. AND MRS. HOWELL MARY ANN (O.S.) "... because he's so rich that everybody knows him. Only, money isn't important to him. He treats me like I'm just as good as he is,..." MARY ANN MARY ANN "... which shows what a wonderful person he is." Mary Ann turns the page. MARY ANN (cont'd) "And his wife, Missus Howell,..." MR. AND MRS. HOWELL MARY ANN (O.S.) "... when they made up the word 'lady' that's who they were talking about." MARY ANN MARY ANN "The Skipper, well, he proved what a captain should be." GINGER AND SKIPPER MARY ANN (O.S.) "If it wasn't for him, we all would have drowned. He piloted the ship, and he kept us all safe..." MARY ANN MARY ANN "... and I wouldn't be writing this if it weren't for him." Mary Ann turns the page. MARY ANN (cont'd) "And then there's a real live movie star with us. Boy, I'd have been afraid to even ask for her autograph,..." GINGER AND SKIPPER MARY ANN (O.S.) "... let alone talk to her, but she's just like a real person and everybody loves her because she's so good." MARY ANN MARY ANN Well, there is more. You can all read it if you like. Mary Ann closes the diary and places it on the dining table. Gilligan emerges from the jungle and walks over to the other castaways. GILLIGAN Hi, everybody. Still mad at me? SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan, little buddy. GILLIGAN Little buddy? SKIPPER Whenever has it been anything else? Skipper puts his arm around Gilligan. GILLIGAN A little while ago you told me that -- PROFESSOR Uh, Skipper, why don't you give Gilligan a chair? SKIPPER Of course, Gilligan, sit down. Gilligan sits down. MR HOWELL Gilligan, my boy, I'd like you to accept my humble apologies. Mr. Howell extends his hand to shake. GILLIGAN Oh, you're gonna apologize to me, Mister Howell? Gilligan shakes his hand. MR HOWELL Absolutely. Ginger hands Gilligan a coconut cup. GINGER Would you like some coconut juice, Gilligan? Gilligan accepts the cup. GILLIGAN Thank you. Gilligan notices his diary sitting on the table. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Oh, my diary. Oh. He pages through it. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Gee, I'd like to write all this down in my diary. But I guess it's just a dream. Gilligan smiles. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. CAMP - NIGHT The Howells emerge from their hut, walk over to the campfire and toss Mr. Howell's pages in to the fire. They turn and leave as quietly as they came. Ginger and Mary Ann appear on the other side of campfire. Ginger tosses her pages into the fire. She watches that they catch fire. The girls leave. Skipper emerges from the boys hut, walks over the campfire and tosses his pages into the fire. He sits down on a chair. Gilligan emerges from the boys hut reading a book. Professor stands in the boys hut door, watching Gilligan approach the campfire. Gilligan begins to toss the book into the fire, but Skipper stops him. SKIPPER No, don't! The other castaways appear out of seemingly nowhere to stop Gilligan from burning that book. GINGER Not that one. MR HOWELL My boy, that book must be preserved at any cost! GILLIGAN I don't understand. PROFESSOR What he means, Gilligan, is -- Well, we see ourselves as we are and you see us as we would like to be. GILLIGAN You got me more mixed up than I was before. MARY ANN Oh, let me try. Gilligan, what he's trying to say is that the book means more to us than it does to you. GILLIGAN "A Boy Scouts' Guide Through New Jersey?" Mary Ann looks puzzled and glances at Skipper. SKIPPER We thought it was your diary. GILLIGAN No, I hid that. Mary Ann smiles. SKIPPER Good. GILLIGAN Someday I'll remember where I hid it. The castaways exchange glances and disperse. Gilligan turns around to tend the fire. His book, "My Diary," is in his back pocket. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT FADE OUT.

It's ignition, contact, choke, throttle stick, flaps!  PROFESSOR Say that's worth a try!  GILLIGAN Or is it flaps, choke, throttle, stick contact?   SKIPPER Oh never mind Gilligan you couldn't make it to the cockpit!  PROFESSOR If there was only some reason Wrong Way had to go back.  SKIPPER Yes a real GOOD reason like an emergency or something! Hey that's it! A doctor! Wa…when I was in the Navy we had to send all the way back to port for a doctor!  PROFESSOR Maybe you've got something there!  GILLIGAN I could pretend I was sick!  SKIPPER Gilligan you won't have to pretend cause you'll just mess it up! I'll take care of this! You find Wrong Way while I get set!  FLIP TO: INT - SKIPPER & GILLIGAN'S HUT - DAY   The skipper is laying in his hammock moaning with pain. Gilligan is seen leading Wrong Way into the hut.  SKIPPER Oh! Oh!  GILLIGAN There he is! Something's wrong with him!  WRONG WAY Oh where does it hurt!  SKIPPER Right here Wrong Way!  Wrong Way pokes the skipper.  SKIPPER Op…ep…ep…oh!!  WRONG WAY I think it might be your appendix. Either that or you been eatin those wild radishes again.   SKIPPER I think it's my appendix Wrong Way.  GILLIGAN He needs a doctor!  WRONG WAY Your right he needs an operation immediately!  GILLIGAN We'll have to go back and get a doctor.  WRONG WAY Ah not necessary I'll do it myself!  GILLIGAN You can take out an appendix!?  WRONG WAY Course! Under battlefield conditions. I done it for my old friend Buckey Lorenzo!  SKIPPER Bu…but I think I need a doctor!  WRONG WAY Funny, that's what Buckey said too! But it come out beautifully! Of course I did make the incision a little too long. But that didn't bother old Buckey! He.he just wore his bathin suit a little higher after that!  SKIPPER Oh I…I feel great! Ya…you won't have to operate after all!  WRONG WAY You all say that, ya…hold him down Gilligan.  Gilligan does what he's told and holds the skipper down. Wrong Way turns away to get some medical items.  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) What are you doing Gilligan!?  GILLIGAN Don't worry skipper you'll be alright just take it easy.  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) You idiot there's nothing wrong with me!  GILLIGAN Oh yeah I forgot. I've got to get you out of here.  Wrong Way steps back over to the skipper. The skipper has now gotten up and is eager to leave.  WRONG WAY Alright Gilligan I'll be back in a minute I gotta berl these instruments.  GILLIGAN Oh but how can you operate, you don't have any anesthetic?  WRONG WAY Oh I'll do the same thing for him I done for old Buckey. Hit him behind the ear with a monkey wrench.  With that said, the skipper springs to life and decides to demonstrate he's in perfect health.  SKIPPER Oh but Wrong Way you won't have to, see I…I…I feel great! I….look I'm dancing!!  The skipper is hopping and prancing around to convince Wrong Way he's ok.  WRONG WAY Delirious already!  SKIPPER Well I want to tell you I can run too! See!?  WRONG WAY Well I guess now's the time!  Wrong Way raises the wrench as though he's going to knock the skipper out. The skipper sees the wrench and makes his way quickly out of the hut.  WRONG WAY Maybe it was the wild radishes after all.  Wrong Way takes a look at Gilligan with a raised wrench.  WRONG WAY How do you feel?  GILLIGAN Fine!! Fine!  Gilligan also runs out of the hut.  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The skipper and Gilligan are quietly talking  near the side of the hut as they set up yet another plan to fool Wrong Way.  SKIPPER Make this look good Gilligan, it might be our last chance.  GILLIGAN I'll do my best.  SKIPPER Remember the symptoms. You got to make him think that you got Bola Bola fever.  GILLIGAN Yeah.

CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The skipper and Gilligan are ready to spring their deception on Wrong Way. The skipper gives Gilligan a pat on the back for encouragement.  SKIPPER Get going.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  Gilligan has taken on a sickly appearance and starts wheezing as he makes his way towards Wrong Way.  CUT TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan begins his wheezing and is walking in a labored way as he encounters Wrong Way. Wrong Way notices Gilligan and becomes concerned.  WRONG WAY Ah…oh Gilligan. What is it!?  Gilligan begins wheezing more intently now.  GILLIGAN (LABORED) Oh I feel terrible!  WRONG WAY Wha…wha…wha…what's wrong!?  GILLIGAN (LABORED) Oh…oh I got a dry mouth…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP GILLIGAN'S HAND  We see that the five major symptoms are written on Gilligan's fingers.  GILLIGAN (LABORED) …ahhhhh stomach ache dizziness ringing ears and a sore head yeah that's it!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The skipper walks on camera faking concern for Gilligan.  SKIPPER Gilligan!

WRONG WAY I seen him staggering along I don't know.  SKIPPER Wha…wha…what do you think Wrong Way!  Wrong Way helps Gilligan sit down at the table.  WRONG WAY Ah…ah…ah could be ah jungle fever, then again…  Wrong Way starts to poke at Gilligan.  WRONG WAY …does it hurt here?  Gilligan tries to repress his laughter at being tickled.

WRONG WAY No it's not as serious, it's probably just a, twenty four hour Bola Bola.  SKIPPER Well how do you know!?  WRONG WAY Because with a serious Bola Bola you get nose bleeds!  Gilligan has a horrified look on his face on hearing that. The skipper picks up Gilligan and is about to take him aside.  SKIPPER We'll be right back!  The skipper is about to take Gilligan away to add a little realism to Gilligan's symptoms.  WRONG WAY No…no…no that's tropical Bola Bola fever! No with the Bola Bola you just have the fainting!  Gilligan drops to the ground one more time.  SKIPPER He's getting worse! He needs help!  WRONG WAY Your right, maybe the professor can fix him up huh!  SKIPPER Wrong Way he needs a doctor!  WRONG WAY Wa… that would mean goin back to Hawaia. I'll have to think that over. Goin back to Hawaia?  A look of desperation comes over Wrong Way's face as we…  FADE OUT      ACT TWO FADE IN:  EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  The skipper and Gilligan are sitting at the table contemplating what to do next.  GILLIGAN Skipper, if I see Wrong Way, do I have to faint again?  SKIPPER No you did it enough yesterday. We haven't convinced him by now it's just no use.  GILLIGAN Good I hate to faint, it hurts when you hit the ground.  Mary Ann walks on camera carrying a bamboo pole with large gourds on the ends filled with water.  MARY ANN Good morning!  SKIPPER Well there's not much…  GILLIGAN Good morning.  SKIPPER Oh good morning Mary Ann.  MARY ANN Where's Wrong Way? Isn't he having breakfast?  GILLIGAN He's probably asleep.  MAY ANN Oh no he isn't I went down to wake him and he wasn't there!  SKIPPER Well maybe he's down at the Lagoon!  MARY ANN Oh, ok, your coffee will be ready in a minute.  PROFESSOR (OFF SCREEN) Hey!  At hearing the professor, Mary Ann turns to look and hits the skipper with one of the gourds splashing water. The professor comes running on camera carrying a bamboo pole with a white piece of paper attached to the end.  PROFESSOR Gilligan! Everybody he's gone!  SKIPPER Who's gone!?  PROFESSOR Wrong Way! He's gone to get help!  GILLIGAN Oh it worked it worked!  Mr. Howell comes running on screen.  MR HOWELL Wha…wha…what's all this excitement!?  PROFESSOR It's Wrong Way, I found this note at the clearing!  MR HOWELL Yes well read it.  The professor takes the note and starts to read…  PROFESSOR Listen. BEING A MAN OF CONSCIENCE AND PRINCIPLE, I FOUND MYSELF FACED WITH A DIFFICULT…  MR HOWELL Never mind the memoirs, get to the important part!  PROFESSOR Aaaah…AND SO, AND SO I DECIDED THAT GILLIGAN'S LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY SELFISH NEEDS. THUS I HAVE GONE TO THE MAIN LAND. IT'S A FAR FAR BETTER THING I DO. BE RIGHT BACK!  MRS HOWELL Ooooh! Thurston we're going to be rescued!  MR HOWELL Yes, unless he's gone the wrong way again!  It is a possibility!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  All the castaways are seated around the dining table with their suitcases and bags packed, waiting for Wrong Way's return.  MRS HOWELL (DEPRESSINGLY) I wonder what's taking him so long!  GINGER Hope he can find Hawaii.  MARY ANN I wonder if they'll send a boat or a plane.  MR HOWELL Where he landed they'll probably send a kayak.  SKIPPER You know the first thing I do when I get back is I'm going to have a thick juicy steak!  MARY ANN Gee I can hardly wait to see my mother I've never been gone this long without calling her.  GILLIGAN Me too.  GINGER I can't wait to see my name up in lights. Ginger Googenhiemer.  GILLIGAN Isn't your name Ginger Grant?  GINGER Yeah but if my names going to be in lights, I want as many lights as I can get.  SKIPPER Oh…I think I'll have a nice ice cold beer too!  PROFESSOR I just want to sleep in a nice soft bed. What are you going to do Mr. Howell?  MR HOWELL Double the rent!  MRS HOWELL Awe Thurston!  MR HOWELL Is that wrong Lovey?

GILLIGAN I think I see Wrong Way's plane!  SKIPPER Lets go towards the clearing!  The castaways are totally excited and are making exclamations ad lib as they rush their way towards the clearing where Wrong Way is going to land.  FADE TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY - COCKPIT VIEW - FORWARD  As in the beginning, the castaways have gathered in the clearing where Wrong Way has landed his plane. We can see the castaways from Wrong Ways view point in the cockpit waving and cheering.  CUT TO: CLOSE SHOT - WRONG WAY  The castaways are standing next to the plane as Wrong Way unstraps from the cockpit and stands up.  GILLIGAN Hey Wrong Way! You made it back!  WRONG WAY Mission accomplished!  GINGER Awe you did it Wrong Way you did it!  WRONG WAY Oh please…please. Ah bein a man of conscience and principle, I found myself faced…  MR HOWELL What is that your graduation speech! We've heard that before!  Wrong Way reaches into the plane and brings out a bottle of something. While giving Mr. Howell a dirty look.  WRONG WAY Well here you are Gilligan.  GILLIGAN What is it?  WRONG WAY The Bola Bola serum.  PROFESSOR Well what about a doctor isn't someone following you?  WRONG WAY Certainly not! I had a heck of a time gettin that without bein noticed!  SKIPPER You mean you didn't contact anyone!?  WRONG WAY And give up our privacy!? Your lucky nobody seen me leave! I had to take off behind a pack of pelicans!  GINGER You mean nobody knows we're here!?  WRONG WAY (HAPPILY) Not from me!!  Ginger lets out a moan and faints.  WRONG WAY Oh…fainted huh?  Mrs. Howell on seeing Ginger faint, faints herself.  WRONG WAY Ahhhh…it's a good thing I got back in time, looks like an epidemic!  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE RIDGE - DAY  The skipper, Gilligan and the professor are back on top of the ridge with the telescope. The professor is looking through the telescope at the horizon.  GILLIGAN See anything professor?  PROFESSOR No not yet.  SKIPPER We should keep looking. Somebody might have followed him.  GILLIGAN Here I'll take over for a while.  Gilligan starts looking through the telescope as the professor had done.  PROFESSOR Boy I was sure Wrong Way was going to come back with a doctor.  SKIPPER In our state of mind he should have brought back a psychiatrist!  Gilligan was scanning the interior of the island and not the oceans horizon.  GILLIGAN Hey there's Wrong Way!  CUT TO: CIRCULAR MASKED CLOSE UP - WRONG WAY AGAINST TREE  SKIPPER (OFF SCREEN) Wonderful.  GILLIGAN (OFF SCREEN) He's leaning up against a tree.  PROFESSOR (OFF SCREEN) Well I guess he's got what he wants.  SKIPPER (OFF SCREEN) Peace and serenity.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  SKIPPER Oooo what I wouldn't give for a little NOISE!  GILLIGAN Me too. I miss all the shoving and shouting and pushing.  PROFESSOR I could use a little of that myself. Saturday night at the library. The hustle and the bustle at the reference desk.  SKIPPER Give Wrong Way a little hustle bustle. Shake him up a bit!  PROFESSOR Say what if we did give Wrong Way a little hustle bustle?  GILLIGAN He'd get so mad he'd leave the island!  SKIPPER That's IT! We'll give him exactly what he's been complaining about! We'll make this island twice as bad as civilization!  PROFESSOR He'll sure be glad to get out of here!  SKIPPER RIGHT!!  FLIP TO: STOCK SHOT OF OCEAN BEACH EARLY MORNING  FADE TO: INT - HUT - MORNING  We see Wrong Way sleeping in his hammock as a terrible noise of construction is heard.  The noise is making Wrong Way toss and turn. The noise finally wakes up Wrong Way who is confused about what he hears. He gets up and starts to head outside.  PAN/FOLLOW TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - MORNING  We see Wrong Way as he heads out of the hut and we see the construction project that the skipper, Gilligan and the professor are working on complete with hammering and sawing. Wrong Way walks out to the construction site with a confused and agitated expression.  WRONG WAY What's goin on here!!  SKIPPER Well everybody up, it's time to work!  CUT TO: EXT - CLEARING - MORNING  WRONG WAY WORK!?  SKIPPER Well certainly, didn't you know? We're trying to build a city!  WRONG WAY A city?  PROFESSOR Sure, just like back home.  GILLIGAN Yeah we got to get civilized.  WRONG WAY Ah…fine, you'z fellas get civilized I'm goin back to bed.  SKIPPER Just a minute Wrong Way not so fast!  The skipper picks up a sledge hammer.  SKIPPER Now you take this sledge and get over there and start driving those stakes in.  WRONG WAY Why me!!  SKIPPER Everyone does his part!  WRONG WAY Wha…wha…What's your part!?  SKIPPER My part is to see that you do your part, I'm the foreman now start driving that stake in the ground!  Wrong Way gives the skipper a dirty look and takes the sledge hammer to where the stake is. He makes an attempt to drive the stake in, but because the sledge is so heavy, wrong Way falls over as we…  FADE TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Wrong Way is seen pedaling a bicycle power unit that is driving a fifty gallon drum lying on it's side. Ginger is standing beside him watching.  GINGER You better hurry up with the clay. The professor's waiting to bake the bricks.  WRONG WAY (EXHAUSTED) Ah this is the first time I ever been in a six day clay race.  Just then a Conch shell horn can be heard blowing.  WRONG WAY What's that?  INGER Coffee break.  WRONG WAY (EXHAUSTED) Thank goodness.  Wrong Way stops pedaling and wants to take a rest.  GINGER (FRANTIC) Hey don't stop! The clay is hardening!  Wrong Way starts pedaling again, As he lets out a groan of exhaustion.  WRONG WAY How am I gonna drink my coffee!?  GINGER I'll get it for you. Don't slow down, the clay'll harden.  Ginger walks over and comes back with a soup ladle made from a coconut with a bamboo shaft.  GINGER Here you are.  She holds it for Wrong Way as he takes a sip. Wrong Way's reaction to the coffee is one of revolt.  WRONG WAY That's awful!! What is that!?  GINGER It's coffee!  WRONG WAY It's coffee!!?  GINGER Oh we make it from fish! I mean the instant's not as good as the regular but…here.  She tries to give Wrong Way another taste.  WRONG WAY No I don't want anymore!  Ginger notices that Wrong Way is at his breaking point and decides to push him even further.  GINGER SKIPPER! He's ready!  WRONG WAY A little cream cheese on a roll? A prune Danish?  The skipper carrying more clay powder walks from the jungle and starts to pour it in the drum for Wrong Way to stir. Wrong Way has stopped his pedaling.  SKIPPER Well come on don't stop pumping wrong Way there's lots more clay where this came from!  Wrong Way starts again and is getting extremely tired. Ginger helps Wrong Way by pushing his legs up and down  SKIPPER Pump, that's it pump!  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  We open by seeing a hand made sign that reads "FREEWAY UNDER CONSTRUCTION" as Mr. And Mrs. Howell are off screen in a wooded part of the island. Gilligan brings Wrong Way over to the Howells.  GILLIGAN OK Wrong Way, you work here for a while on the freeway.  WRONG WAY Freewa…What do we need a freeway for we…we don't even have one single car!!?  MRS HOWELL Well we can't let everything go to the last minute!  GILLIGAN Mr. Howell is in charge see you later!  Gilligan walks off camera as Wrong Way is now stuck helping the Howells.  MR HOWELL Oh ah you're the new man Aye?  WRONG WAY Oh I ain't never done this kind of work before.  MRS HOWELL You'll adore it!! Getting down to mother earth! There's nothing like the feeling of dirt against your opera gloves!  WRONG WAY FREEWAY!!  MRS HOWELL Well how else are we going to get down to the new music center!?   MR HOWELL Ah not to mention the art museum and the city hall, you see it's part of our slum clearance project!  Mr. And Mrs. Howell are raking the ground when they get their rakes locked together.  MRS HOWELL Ooooo darling how marvelous! We haven't even finished the freeway and we've had our first accident!  MR HOWELL (TO WRONG WAY) Just don't stand there get to work!  Mr. Howell hands Wrong Way an axe.  WRONG WAY An Axe!?  MR HOWELL Yes you have to work over here you see, and when you finished chopping that tree down (pause) there's fifteen more just like it over there!  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE – EVENING  Wrong Way is seen dragging himself through the jungle. We pan along with him as he comes into the clearing. He barely manages to stager over to a table and sit down. Mary Ann is present and is cleaning up dishes from dinner.  MARY ANN Well how'd it go Wrong Way are you finished?  WRONG WAY (VERY TIRED) Just about. What's for supper?  MARY ANN Soup and salad, fish oh yes and uh, Ginger made one of her delicious deserts.  WRONG WAY Oh great cause I'm almost starved!   MARY ANN Awe, to bad you missed it!  Mary Ann takes away something Wrong Way found on the table and is trying to eat. Wrong Way breaks down and starts to cry.  CUT TO: INT - SKIPPER & GILLIGAN'S HUT - NIGHT  Gilligan and the skipper are in side by side hammocks with Wrong Way in the middle between them. The hammocks are lightly swinging back and forth and nearly touch Wrong Way with every swing.  GILLIGAN Tired huh Wrong Way?  WRONG WAY (SARCASTIC) What ever gave you that idea.  SKIPPER Ah that's one thing that's so nice about the islands. Peace and quiet. No traffic noises to wake you up. No noisy neighbors.  WRONG WAY Wha…can't you two shut up and get a little sleep!  GILLIGAN Good night Wrong Way.  WRONG WAY Ah yeah.  SKIPPER Good night Wrong Way.  Wrong Way does not respond.  SKIPPER I said good night!  WRONG WAY Good night already!  GILLIGAN Skipper, do you mind if I read?  SKIPPER No not at all.   GILLIGAN How about you Wrong Way?  WRONG WAY (MUMBLED) no no  Gilligan lights his lantern and then places it on Wrong Ways chest so he can see to read.  WRONG WAY Hey what is this a hut or a light house!!  GILLIGAN I don't want to hurt my eyes.  Gilligan opens a comic book and starts to read.  GILLIGAN Let's see. Reggy stood at the door way, his finger on the trigger of a snub nose thirty eight. His eyes were transfixed…(pause) Hey skipper? What does this mean here?  Gilligan leans over to the skipper and points to some words in the comic book. He's definitely invading Wrong Ways space.  SKIPPER What?  GILLIGAN Here.  SKIPPER Where?  Wrong Ways had enough.  WRONG WAY Do you mind!?  SKIPPER I'm not sure Gilligan.  WRONG WAY Please, I gotta get some sleep!!  SKIPPER Alright Gilligan, turn off the light.  Wrong Way lets out a moan. Gilligan, now having turned off the light, reaches over and pulls out an apple. He starts eating it with loud crunching sounds.  WRONG WAY What is it an Earth quake!?  GILLIGAN No it's an apple, do you want one?  WRONG WAY No.  SKIPPER Oh hey you got any carrots over there?  GILLIGAN No, I got some celery.  SKIPPER Oh good.  Gilligan hands the skipper an entire stalk of celery. The skipper starts to eat the celery, again with a loud crunching sound.  WRONG WAY Couldn't you eat a nice quiet banana? Get some SLEEP!  SKIPPER Oh Wrong Way? You can sleep late tomorrow morning.  WRONG WAY I can!?  SKIPPER Sure tomorrow's Saturday.  WRONG WAY (EXCITEDLY) Oh that's wonderful! Wonderful! Tha…thank you skipper! Thank you! It's wonderful I can sleep! I can sleep!  Gilligan and the skipper are still making horrible crunching sounds when suddenly Wrong Way sits up with a depressed look on his face.  GILLIGAN What's the matter?  WRONG WAY I'm too excited, I can't sleep!  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - MORNING  All the castaways are sitting around the table talking about Wrong Way.  PROFESSOR Where is he now?  SKIPPER Well he's probably down at the lagoon, I haven't let him wash in three days.  MR HOWELL Well I HOPE he's down there!  GILLIGAN He better break pretty soon or we will.  MR HOWELL I can't work anymore, I've got to get excused tomorrow. I…I promise Lovey will give me a note.  PROFESSOR Well we got to keep this up, even at our own expense.

SKIPPER Yes I thought about that but I was afraid to say anything.  MRS HOWELL Oh no he couldn't have!  MR HOWELL Well don't worry dear, he's probably covered!  PROFESSOR Well…I'm sure at least he tried.  GINGER Oh yes, we have to give him credit for trying.  Suddenly Gilligan comes running on camera with a bottle in his hand.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper! Skipper skipper!  SKIPPER What is it!?  GILLIGAN (OVERY EXCITED) A note, there's a note from Wrong Way!! In a bottle! I found it down there at the beach!  SKIPPER Let me see that!

It is up to Gilligan to destroy the monster.  “St. Gilligan and the Dragon”  By  Arnold Peyser  and  Lois Peyser  February 13, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT EXT. CAMP - MORNING Gilligan, Skipper, and Professor sit at the dining table eating breakfast. Bowls of fruit, guava jelly, and other foodstuffs await eating. But Mary Ann lectures the men. MARY ANN And, gentlemen, we've listened to your excuses long enough and we we're not going to put up with it any longer. SKIPPER May I have the guava jelly? GINGER We've simply got to have some privacy! SKIPPER Where is the guava jelly? MARY ANN You haven't heard a word we've said! SKIPPER Sure I did. You want more privacy. Now may I have the guava jelly? GINGER No, you can't. MARY ANN Oh, and we're not gonna serve you anything else, either. Mary Ann removes a bowl of fruit from the table. GINGER If you don't cooperate with us, we won't cooperate with you. Ginger picks up a bowl and fills it with fruit from the table. GILLIGAN Here's the guava jelly, Skipper. Gilligan reaches for the guava jelly and passes it to Skipper. Ginger grabs the dish of guava jelly. Ginger and Gilligan struggle over the dish. GINGER Oh, no, you don't. GILLIGAN Oh, yes, I do. GINGER Oh, no, you don't. GILLIGAN Oh, yes, I do. They spill it on Skipper. GINGER Oh! SKIPPER (to Ginger) Oh, yes, you did. (to Gilligan) Thanks a lot, Gilligan. MARY ANN (smugly) By the way, we're not gonna do any more washing, either. GINGER And besides, you said you'd build us a hut last week. PROFESSOR Well, we've had other things to do that are more important. We'll get to it as soon as we can. MARY ANN Oh, well, uh, there won't be any lunch today. We have other things to do that are more important. Mary Ann carries an armful of food and exits. GINGER We'll get to it as soon as we can. Ginger carries her armload of food away too. Ginger exits. Mr. and Mrs. Howell arrive for breakfast. MR HOWELL I'm sorry we're late for breakfast. MRS HOWELL Yes, you see, we're used to having breakfast in bed, served by our butler. MR HOWELL That's after his butler serves him breakfast in bed. That's the only way to live. Here you are, Lovey, my pet. MRS HOWELL Oh, dear. Isn't there anything left? SKIPPER I'm sorry, Missus Howell, but Mary Ann and Ginger are on strike. The Howells sit down at the table. MR HOWELL On strike? By George, you get two workers together, they'll organize every time. Mrs. Howell nods. Mary Ann and Ginger return to make their case. MARY ANN You men keep promising to build us a hut and won't keep your promises. GINGER We think that women should have the same rights as men. Mr. Howell laughs. MR HOWELL Did you hear that, Lovey? "Women should have the same rights as men." Mr. Howell laughs again, but stops abruptly. MR HOWELL (cont'd) You're not laughing, Lovey, with me. MRS HOWELL Thurston, you've been promising me to build a hut of our own for weeks now. MR HOWELL Well, I'll get to it by and by. MRS HOWELL But I'm not asking for anything elaborate, just a little split-level hut, or a palm tree penthouse. PROFESSOR Well, I'm afraid you women are going to have to face the facts. Historically, it's the man who decides what should be done. Professor gets up from the table and exits.

Ginger realizes that since she sees the men, they are not inside the monster and her expression becomes fear. Ginger urgently taps Mrs. Howell on the shoulder. Mrs. Howell turns. Ginger points behind them. All three women realize the men are not operating the monster and scream. They flee their hut and run toward the men. MRS HOWELL Thurston, you've got to save us. The women cower behind the men. Mrs. Howell hides behind Mr. Howell. Mary Ann hides behind Gilligan. Ginger hides behind Professor. SKIPPER What's going on here? GINGER Over there! Look! WEATHER BALLOON MONSTER as it flutters in the breeze. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER Gilligan, we'll get a closer look at this. GILLIGAN I can see it fine from here, Skipper. SKIPPER Professor, you're in charge. C'mon, we'll be right back. Gilligan and Skipper investigate and exit. WEATHER BALLOON MONSTER EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT Skipper and Gilligan move closer to the monster and stop. Gilligan follows Skipper closely. Too closely for Skipper. SKIPPER Gilligan, would you stop? (looks at the monster) Sure is weird looking. GILLIGAN Skipper, let's get out of here. SKIPPER Wait a minute. We can't. One of us got to keep an eye on it. GILLIGAN What's the other one of us have to do? SKIPPER We've got to go back and report to the others. GILLIGAN I volunteer for that. Gilligan salutes and turns to leave, but Skipper stops him. SKIPPER You'll do as I say. GILLIGAN Aye aye, sir. SKIPPER Keep an eye on it. Don't let it get away. GILLIGAN Which eye? Gilligan covers one eye briefly. They exchange glances. Gilligan looks fearful. Skipper returns to the others. EXT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT Skipper approaches the other castaways who are huddled together. MRS HOWELL I don't know what I do without you. MARY ANN Oh, where's Gilligan? MR HOWELL Gilligan's been eaten! Mary Ann screams. SKIPPER Gilligan is fine! EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT Gilligan holds a bamboo pole and a palm frond like a knight would hold a lance and a shield. Gilligan shakes the palm frond out of nervousness. Gilligan sizes up the monster. GILLIGAN I'll destroy that monster. I'll save us. EXT. GIRLS HUT - NIGHT No longer scared, Professor presses forward. PROFESSOR Wait, Skipper! That monster suddenly looks very familiar. SKIPPER Familiar? PROFESSOR It's a lost weather balloon! It's our rescue! We can inflate it and send it up with messages. SKIPPER And they always have radio equipment. We're saved! Ginger and Mary Ann scream. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT Gilligan holds the bamboo pole as jousting pole and palm frond as a shield. He musters his courage. GILLIGAN Ready or not, here I come! Gilligan closes his eyes and charges at the monster. The pole punctures the monster weather balloon. As he removes the pole, the gas inside escapes in a torrential wind. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hot wind! He's trying to breathe fire on me. If Saint George can do it, Gilligan can! Gilligan rushes the monster weather balloon again. He jumps on it and beats it with the pole. He sees the electronic components on the ground and mistakes it for the monster's brains. GILLIGAN (cont'd) The brains! He beats the electronics with the pole. The other castaways rush up to Gilligan. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I did it. I did it. I killed it! Professor picks up the electronic debris. Skipper reaches down and grasps a section of the balloon. Gilligan points at the destroyed electronics that the Professor holds. GILLIGAN (cont'd) That's the brains. Skipper holds up a section of fabric. On it are the letters "USAF." GILLIGAN (cont'd) Us-uff? SKIPPER United States Air Force balloon! GILLIGAN Oh. Skipper throws the balloon to the ground. The castaways are disappointed in Gilligan. Gilligan sinks to the ground in embarrassment. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Skipper works on the balloon's electronics on a small table near the lagoon. In frustration, he slams the electronics to the table. Professor, standing near the water, turns to Skipper. SKIPPER Gilligan certainly did a thorough job on this radio. It's absolutely useless. Professor walks closer to Skipper. PROFESSOR You know, Skipper, I've been thinking. We've still got a chance with that balloon. SKIPPER What do you mean, Professor? PROFESSOR Well, I can sew up the rips in the cloth. I can use some tree sap to seal it, and some hot air from the fire to inflate it. SKIPPER It'll make a great rescue signal. PROFESSOR Exactly. A plane or a ship is bound to spot it. Gilligan enters. He hides what appears to be cloth behind his back. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. Hi, Professor. Skipper notices that Gilligan is hiding the cloth. SKIPPER Hi, Gilligan. And what have you got, Gilligan? GILLIGAN It's a big secret. I've been working on it for days. Look. Gilligan reveals the cloth squares. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Material for skirts, for dresses, for the hut. Skipper glances at Professor. SKIPPER And where did you get that, Gilligan? Gilligan smiles broadly. GILLIGAN From the balloon, I cut it up in little pieces. Gilligan claps in happiness. Professor palms his face. Skipper gives an aside glance and holds up a square of fabric showing the letters "USAF." He nods and looks at Gilligan. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT FADE OUT. THE END 
Episode #12, “Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk” Gilligan's Christmas wish appears to be coming true when a radio broadcast tells them their rescue is imminent. While they wait, they recall the first days on the island when Gilligan lost the radio and transmitter.  “Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk”  By  Sherwood Schwartz,  Austin Kalish,  and  Elroy Schwartz  December 19, 1964  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY RADIO "JINGLE BELLS" plays on the radio. PULL BACK TO REVEAL the castaways decorating a Christmas tree made from tropical island parts. MR HOWELL First time I ever celebrated Christmas with a bamboo tree. They decorate the tree. MRS HOWELL And seashells for ornaments. PROFESSOR Well, it's the best we could do here on the island. They decorate the tree. SKIPPER Right. Do you know what I want for Christmas? A nice, thick, juicy steak. GINGER I know what I'd like for Christmas, but I don't think Cary Grant will fit in my stocking. Gilligan places a starfish at the top of the tree. GILLIGAN You know what I want for Christmas? I wish we could be rescued. MARY ANN Oh, what a wonderful Christmas wish, Gilligan. PROFESSOR But I'm afraid that's asking just a bit too much from old Santa Claus. RADIO RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) We interrupt this program to bring you a special news ... BACK TO SCENE The Castaways gather around the radio. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) ... bulletin. A group of castaways was spotted on a small island a short time ago by a Navy weather plane. These marooned people are believed to be the crew and passengers of the S.S. Minnow ... The Castaways cheer. The Professor shushes them. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) ... a small excursion boat which was presumed lost at sea. In the event the castaways can hear this broadcast, let me assure them that a Navy destroyer has been dispatched to the area pinpointed by the plane. We now return you to our regular program. The Castaways cheer. MARY ANN Gilligan, you got what you wished for! SKIPPER What a Christmas present! MR HOWELL For Christmas, I want to buy everybody their own island! FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. OCEAN BEACH - DAY Skipper and Gilligan build a signal fire with plenty of smoke. OCEAN BEACH Nothing but waves all the way to the horizon. BACK TO SCENE Skipper scans the horizon for a ship. SKIPPER That fire and smoke ought to help that Navy destroyer to spot us. GILLIGAN Right, Skipper. Lucky thing I made that Christmas wish, huh? SKIPPER Oh, you're so right, little buddy. I want to tell you, you've had your share of mistakes, but that wish has made up for all of them. Nothing you could do now can make me angry. GILLIGAN Thanks, Skipper. SKIPPER Well, let's see if we can spot that ship out there. Hand me the binocular. Gilligan fishes the binoculars from the smoky signal fire. SKIPPER (cont'd) Come on, Gilligan. I said hand me the binocular. Gilligan retrieves the binoculars from the signal fire. It is very hot and Gilligan holds it by the cord. GILLIGAN Remember what you said, Skipper. You're not gonna get angry at me. Skipper grabs the binocular and realizes it is hot from the fire. GILLIGAN (cont'd) You did it, Skipper. You controlled yourself. Congratulations. SKIPPER Thanks, Gilligan. As a matter of fact, we've suffered through worse experiences than this. Remember when we first landed on the island? GILLIGAN I sure do. After I lost the anchor and the compass got broken during the storm, I thought we were goners. SKIPPER But we were real lucky, little buddy. I mean, the fact that the tide left us high and dry during the night. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK - EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY The beached S.S. Minnow lies on the sand. EXT. S.S. MINNOW AFT DECK - DAY Skipper sits up and looks around. Skipper sees that the S.S. Minnow is beached. The other castaways sleep soundly on the S.S. Minnow. Skipper jumps off the deck onto the beach. SKIPPER Hey, Gilligan. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Skipper lands on the beach and walks around the stern of the beached S.S. Minnow. The Skipper walks along the beach sand, quickly surveying the area. SKIPPER (CONT'D) Gilligan! EXT. S.S. MINNOW AFT DECK - DAY Gilligan awakens and hears the Skipper calling to him. SKIPPER (O.S.) Hey, Gilligan! GILLIGAN Oh, my gosh! Man over board. Gilligan dives off the stern of the S.S. Minnow. GILLIGAN (CONT'D) I'll save you, Skipper! EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Gilligan lies on the sand face down. He lifts his head up to see Skipper. The Skipper grabs Gilligan and lifts him by the belt to a seated position. SKIPPER Gilligan, the Minnow's been beached. GILLIGAN Beached? When the storm was over and it was calm, you said we'd be home in no time. SKIPPER It may take longer. GILLIGAN When the passengers wake up and want to get off at the marina, what are you going to tell them? SKIPPER I'll think of something. STARBOARD SIDE OF S.S. MINNOW Two obvious, large holes dominate the starboard hull of the S.S. Minnow. GILLIGAN (O.S.) How are we going to get home? Look at those holes! BACK TO SCENE The Skipper scowls at Gilligan. Skipper grabs the brim of his cap as if threatening to hit Gilligan over the head with it. GILLIGAN No, Skipper. I'm very happy to be here. I'm so happy I could kiss the ground. (kisses sand; spits) This island tastes terrible. Skipper notices the other passengers have awoken. MR HOWELL (O.S.) Oh, Captain. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY The Howells make their way from the bow on the port side of the S. S. Minnow to the stern. The Skipper meets them mid-boat. MR HOWELL Oh, Captain. Would you have your man remove our luggage from this vessel? SKIPPER I'd be very happy to, Mister Howell. Where would you have it removed to? MR HOWELL Oh, someplace where the limousine can pick it up and take us to the nearest hotel. SKIPPER That storm drove us hundreds of miles off course. This island doesn't even appear on my Navy charts. MR HOWELL Well, you should have gotten your charts from a more reliable source. SKIPPER There is no more reliable source than the United States Navy! MR HOWELL Oh, yes there is. The Sunnybrook Yacht Club. (salutes) My outfit. Stunned at Mr. Howell's gall, Skipper turns away. MR HOWELL (CONT'D) Come along, Lovey. Mr. Howell offers his arm to Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL You know, I think someone ought to report him. MR HOWELL Well, he will bear watching. The Howells walk away. Skipper turns and heads toward the stern. FLIP TO: EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Gilligan and Skipper discuss their situation next to the Minnow. Gilligan holds his hat in his hands. GILLIGAN You mean we're marooned? Skipper shushes Gilligan. SKIPPER Not so loud. We have three women on board that might panic. GILLIGAN You have one sailor down here that already has. Gilligan puts on his hat. PROFESSOR Skipper, I think I'll have another try at fixing that transmitter. Professor exits. GILLIGAN You mean the radio's broken? SKIPPER The transmitter's broken. The receiver works fine. GILLIGAN With no transmitter, how are we gonna tell the rescue ship where to find us? But Skipper, I'm scared. They move from the beached Minnow closer to the beach. SKIPPER Gilligan, now pull yourself together. There's really nothing to worry about. Sure, we're marooned on an uncharted island. The transmitter's broken, the boat's wrecked, we're low on provisions. Does that sound like the end of the world? GILLIGAN No. But it sounds like the end of us. SKIPPER Gilligan, your job now is to calm the passengers. Cheer them up. GILLIGAN Yes, sir. Keep them calm. Cheer them up. SKIPPER Do you want those people to hear your teeth chattering? Let me have a smile. GILLIGAN If I smile, sir, they'll see my teeth chattering. SKIPPER (irritated) Gilligan. GILLIGAN Yes, sir. Smile. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Mary Ann and Ginger are seated on a log in the jungle clearing. Gilligan stands before them with a large, obviously fake smile. GINGER You certainly do look cheerful. Gilligan points to his smile. GILLIGAN That's probably because I'm smiling. Gilligan points at his smile. MARY ANN You got a message through. We're gonna be saved. GILLIGAN No, we couldn't get a message through. The transmitter's broken. MARY ANN Broken? There's nothing to smile about. GILLIGAN (cheerfully) No, it isn't. Gilligan stops smiling. GILLIGAN (cont'd) (somberly) No, it isn't. GINGER Then why were you smiling? GILLIGAN Skipper's orders. I'm supposed to cheer you up. GINGER What for? GILLIGAN So you won't worry about the mess we're in. Mary Ann stands up. MARY ANN Terrible mess? Oh, Gilligan, are we in danger? GILLIGAN Danger? What makes you say a thing like that? Ginger stands up too. GINGER Gilligan, we're in awful trouble, aren't we? GILLIGAN Not really. There's a chance the transmitter can be fixed. And there's every possibility we won't be eaten by cannibals. Mary Ann and Ginger exchange uncomfortable glances. GILLIGAN (cont'd) If we're careful, we can stretch our food supply to last almost a week. Gilligan stretches out his arms, but realizes how bad their situation actually is. GILLIGAN (cont'd) (glumly) Then when you think about it, things couldn't be worse. FLIP TO: EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY Skipper addresses Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell in front of the beached Minnow. SKIPPER I want you two to see what you can salvage out of the galley. Meanwhile, Gilligan and I will explore the island. Gilligan? EXT. S.S. MINNOW AFT DECK - DAY Gilligan stands tall. He wears binoculars and a spyglass around his neck, has rope draped over his shoulder, carries a canteen, knife, and small bag attached to his belt. GILLIGAN I got the equipment right here, sir.

COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY Gilligan and the Skipper walk through the jungle and stop at a coconut tree. The Skipper looks up at the tree. SKIPPER There's exactly what I've been looking for. GILLIGAN It's a coconut tree. We've passed a thousand of them. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. SKIPPER Not like this one. TWO TALL COCONUT TREES SKIPPER (O.S.) This has got to be the tallest tree on the island. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER Now, from the top of this tree, it'll be possible to see the whole island. Then we'll know whether it is uninhabited or not. GILLIGAN That's a great idea, Skipper. But who's gonna climb up there and look around? I mean, there's only two of us here. And you can't do it because you're the Skipper. And I can't do it because I don't know how to climb a coconut tree. Skipper sternly stares at Gilligan. Gilligan looks up at the tall coconut tree. GILLIGAN (cont'd) (looks up at the tree) Besides, I'm afraid of heights. Skipper sternly stares at Gilligan. GILLIGAN (cont'd) I'm not starting any mutiny, Skipper, but I'm not climbing up that tree. No siree. Not me. VERTICAL FLIP TO: EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY Gilligan sits atop the coconut tree and shields his eyes. TWO TALL COCONUT TREES SKIPPER (O.S.) What do you see?

He notices something and pauses. GILLIGAN Hey, I see something. (pause) I see some people. EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY SKIPPER Is it a village? EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY GILLIGAN It's just some people. But they have a boat, Skipper. They can get us off here. Skipper, we're saved! EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY Skipper looks up toward the top of the coconut tree. EXT. COCONUT TREE TOP - DAY Gilligan quickly climbs down the coconut tree, dislodging many coconuts. CAMERA MOVES WITH Gilligan as he rapidly descends from the top of the coconut tree to the base where Skipper stands. EXT. COCONUT TREE GROVE - DAY Gilligan lands on the Skipper followed by the coconuts raining down. Gilligan gets to his feet and tries to help the Skipper up, but Skipper's weight overwhelms Gilligan. Gilligan tumbles over the Skipper. Another coconut falls on the Skipper. Skipper rises to his feet. And another coconut falls on him. Skipper helps Gilligan to his feet. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Skipper. I'm just so anxious. SKIPPER Never mind that. Are you -- Another coconut falls and hits the Skipper. SKIPPER (cont'd) Are you sure you saw some people? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. And a boat too. Skipper, we're saved! Just follow me. I know exactly where it is. Gilligan turns and exits. Skipper follows him. EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY Gilligan leads the Skipper through the jungle. GILLIGAN Right this way, Skipper. I'm blazing the ol' trail. Gilligan pushes a palm frond out of his way, but it snaps back and hits the Skipper, knocking him to the ground. Gilligan runs along the path and stops to encourage the Skipper. GILLIGAN (cont'd) We're saved. We're saved. C'mon, Skipper! C'mon. Gilligan turns and runs toward the beach. EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY GILLIGAN Here's the beach. Wait until we tell the passengers the good news! Skipper catches up with Gilligan, but Gilligan is too eager to wait for the Skipper to catch his breath so he continues running toward the people. Skipper picks up the pace and runs after him. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY GILLIGAN Whoo! Yippee! Look, Skipper, look. Oh, yippee! Yeah! Yippee! Yahoo! Skipper looks toward the boat. Gilligan notices Skipper's lack of enthusiasm. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hurray! Yippee! Yahoo! (looks closer at boat) Yippee. Ya -- hoo -- ZOOM - GILLIGAN Gilligan's widely opens his eyes as he realizes his mistake. EXT. S.S. MINNOW STERN - DAY LONG SHOT - S.S.

Gilligan walks up the beach carrying his fishing pole. PROFESSOR Skipper, will you switch that to our frequency? I'll hold these two wires together, and then will you try talking into it? Gilligan walks up and stands behind Skipper. SKIPPER Hello? Hello? If anyone can hear me, please answer. GILLIGAN I can hear you fine. SKIPPER It works! It works. PROFESSOR Skipper -- SKIPPER Just a minute, Professor. I think I've got something. Skipper speaks slowly into the microphone. SKIPPER (cont'd) (haltingly) Where are you? GILLIGAN (haltingly) Right behind you. Skipper turns and looks at Gilligan. Gilligan waves his fingers. SKIPPER (irritated) Gilligan. We're trying to fix the transmitter. Gilligan walks around to the transmitter and sticks his hands inside. GILLIGAN Oh. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Maybe if you took one of these tubes in here -- SKIPPER The Professor and I will fix the transmitter. Why don't you try and catch something for dinner? GILLIGAN Right, Skipper. How about fish? SKIPPER Fish sounds just fine. Gilligan salutes, turns, and exits. PROFESSOR Skipper, have you got a smaller screwdriver? SKIPPER I think I have in my toolkit. Skipper gets up and walks back to the S.S. Minnow. EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY As ordered, Gilligan fishes for dinner near the water's edge. EXT. ISLAND BEACH - DAY The Professor works on the transmitter on a large boulder-sized rock near the S.S. Minnow. He uses the radio as a receiver to test the transmitter's signal.

Skipper tumbles into the water. Gilligan stands looking at him. The waves push Skipper toward the beach. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. Goin' in for a dip? Skipper replaces his completely soaked cap on his head. Water runs down his face. Gilligan looks at Skipper in a puzzled way. END FLASHBACK. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Skipper and Gilligan share the story of their first days on the island. SKIPPER Yes, sir, all in all, I'd say we were pretty lucky.

Professor turns the radio on. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... and the Coast Guard cutter reports it is now nearing the island. According to all indications, the crew and passengers of the ess ess Minnow will shortly be leaving the island where they have been marooned. The Professor turns off the radio. MARY ANN Oh, we owe it all to Gilligan and his Christmas wish. GINGER Oh, that's right. Mary Ann and Ginger back Gilligan toward the signal fire and simultaneously kiss him on opposite cheeks. GILLIGAN (bashfully) I feel like I'm on fire. SKIPPER You are. Get your feet out of the fire. Gilligan hurries out of the signal fire. FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT.

GINGER I can't see any ship. SKIPPER Won't be long now. Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell emerge from the jungle. MR HOWELL Where's the rescue party? I thought this was an afternoon affair. SKIPPER Should be here any time now, Mister Howell. MRS HOWELL Well, I certainly hope so, or I'll have to change into evening clothes. Skipper laughs. SKIPPER Gilligan and I were talking about the first day we landed on the island. Remember that? MR HOWELL How can we ever forget? We were all simply furious with Gilligan that day. SKIPPER We certainly were. Skipper pats Gilligan on the back. GILLIGAN I guess everybody was mad at me then. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK - EXT.

SKIPPER Four blankets, one hatchet. PROFESSOR Check. SKIPPER A pistol, flashlight, and a pair of binoculars. PROFESSOR Right. (pause) Well, that completes the list of everything we can salvage from the boat. Skipper, how long do you really think we'll be on this island? SKIPPER With the transmitter on the bottom of the ocean, we're stuck till we're spotted by a plane or a ship. PROFESSOR That could be days or weeks or even months. We've got one box of matches left. Gilligan enters. GILLIGAN Hi. PROFESSOR Oh, hi, Gilligan. SKIPPER (coolly) Gilligan. PROFESSOR We've got to use these very sparingly. Professor hands the box of matches to Skipper, but Gilligan intercepts the box. SKIPPER Gilligan. Skipper takes the box of matches from Gilligan. PROFESSOR Skipper, why don't you two get a fire started? I'll go help the others gather more wood so we can keep it going. SKIPPER Good idea, Professor. The Professor exits.

GILLIGAN We've got to be careful. SKIPPER Gilligan, will you do me a favor? GILLIGAN Do you a favor? Yes, indeed, sir. SKIPPER Will you stop repeating everything I say? GILLIGAN Stop repeating everything you say? Right you are, sir. No more repeating everything you say. SKIPPER (angrily) Gilligan! Skipper regains his composure. SKIPPER (cont'd) All right now, the minute I get the fire started, I want you to blow into it like this -- Skipper demonstrates blowing onto the kindling. GILLIGAN Like this? Gilligan mimics the Skipper's blowing, but more aggressively. Skipper nods. SKIPPER Okay. Here we go. Skipper lights a match. Gilligan blows aggressively and blows out the match. GILLIGAN I guess I blew too soon, huh? Well, I'm sure not gonna do that the next time. Skipper glares at Gilligan. Skipper shakes his head. Gilligan shakes his head in unison. GILLIGAN (cont'd) 'Cause you're not gonna let me do it next time. They both nod in agreement. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY The Skipper uses a mallet to hammer the stake into the soil. Gilligan walks up and offers to help Skipper. GILLIGAN Skipper, can I help you? SKIPPER No, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Please? SKIPPER It's no use, Gilligan. You're just plain ol' bad luck to me. Skipper stops hammering the stake. SKIPPER (cont'd) You remember that time on the destroyer when that depth charge broke loose? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. It was rolling across the deck and I pulled you out of the way. I saved your life. SKIPPER Well, not exactly. You didn't save it, you just prolonged it so you'd give me more bad luck. Now, will you run along? I've got a lot of work to do. Gilligan salutes Skipper. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. Skipper, frustrated but knowing that as a leader he must set an example and follow the rules, returns Gilligan's salute. As Gilligan walks away the Skipper puts down his mallet on his foot. SKIPPER (pained) Oh! Gilligan looks back at the Skipper. SKIPPER (cont'd) Shove off, Gilligan! Gilligan turns and runs from the Skipper. FLIP TO: EXT.

Gilligan reels in the "fish" to his feet. Gilligan beaches the big "fish," which is seen to be a shark! Gilligan wrestles with the shark and subdues it. EXT. S.S. MINNOW BOW DECK - DAY MR HOWELL At a time like this, water sports! (disgusted) I mean, really! EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY Exhausted, Gilligan drags the shark by the tail out of the water onto the beach. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY MONTAGE Gilligan reels in fish. EXT. JUNGLE EDGE - DAY Gilligan carries a big fish and adds it to a large pile of big fish he's caught. Gilligan rearranges the fish when a fish begins to emit the sound of a radio broadcast. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) And now it's time for your ... OPEN-MOUTHED FISH TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) ... daily exercise again. Open the windows, take a deep breath ... BACK TO SCENE Gilligan looks around to locate the source of the voice. He points one ear toward the ground. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) ... and let good ol' Tropical Tom help you stay in shape. First, let's try the simple knee bend. OPEN-MOUTHED FISH TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) Hands on hips now. Bend at the knees and here we go. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan cocks his head and steps around the fish and tries to determine which fish is "speaking." TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Up, down, three, four. Up, down, three, four. OPEN-MOUTHED FISH TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) C'mon, you! Let's get with it. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN Me? TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) I mean you, yes. Gilligan begins knee bends according to Tropical Tom's instructions. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) Up we go, down we go. Up we go, down we go. Up, down, up, down. Gilligan discontinues his knee bends and resumes searching for the sound. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) Up, down, up, down. Gilligan finds a candidate fish and grabs it out of the large pile of fish. TROPICAL TOM (V.O.) (cont'd) (filtered) Up, down, up, down. That's enough now. Relax. Gilligan drops the fish. When the fish lands, the radio program changes to MARCHING BAND MUSIC. Startled, Gilligan picks up the fish again. GILLIGAN The radio. The fish must have swallowed the radio. Gilligan strikes the side of the fish and the radio program changes to a baseball game. BASEBALL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And Mantle hit a bunt single and caught the infield landing. They were expecting him to hit away. This puts men on first and third with one out, with Roger Meris coming up to bat. GILLIGAN Come on, Roger. Get a hit. The fish stops emitting sound of the radio, so Gilligan strikes the side of the fish again. The radio program changes back to MARCHING BAND MUSIC. GILLIGAN (cont'd) The radio. I've got to tell them I caught the radio. Gilligan hoists the fish with the radio over his shoulder and exits. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Gilligan runs over to a large fish lying on the ground. Skipper and Professor follow him. Gilligan picks up the fish. GILLIGAN I caught the radio. Look, I caught the radio. Skipper and Professor exchange skeptical glances. Gilligan hits the side of the fish and it begins making sound from a radio broadcast. SKIPPER Well, I'll be darned. PROFESSOR The fish must've swallowed the radio. GILLIGAN And if this fish swallowed the radio, maybe another one swallowed the transmitter. PROFESSOR Gilligan, the chances of that are absolutely zero. SKIPPER But Professor, what have we got to lose? Gilligan, go get the rest of those fish. Gilligan hands the fish to the Skipper. Gilligan salutes. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. Skipper salutes in return, but hits himself in the head with the fish. SKIPPER Gilligan! Gilligan exits. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY PILE OF FISH PAN UP AND DOLLY BACK to Skipper, Gilligan, Ginger, and Mary Ann. Skipper, Gilligan, Mary Ann, and Ginger stand around a pile of large fish. Skipper holds a fish. SKIPPER Now ladies, I want you to pick up a fish and start squeezing 'em. Maybe we might find the fish that swallowed the transmitter. GILLIGAN Yeah! Professor enters. PROFESSOR Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Skipper, I just tuned the radio to the same wavelength as the transmitter. SKIPPER And? PROFESSOR Well, if you say a few words into a fish and the transmitter's in there, I should be able to hear it on the radio. SKIPPER That's a great idea, Professor! Skipper hands the fish to Gilligan. SKIPPER (cont'd) Well, don't just stand there, Gilligan, say something into the fish. GILLIGAN I've never talked to a fish before. PROFESSOR Say anything. GILLIGAN Hello there, fish! PROFESSOR Louder! Gilligan speaks louder. GILLIGAN (yelling) Hello there, little fish! PROFESSOR No, that's not it. Try another one. Mary Ann and Ginger bend down and talk into fish. MARY ANN Hello? Hello, Kansas? SKIPPER Hello, this is the ess ess Minnow. This is the Skipper of the ess ess Minnow. On an uncharted island. Professor listens to the radio and shakes his head. MARY ANN Hello, Uncle George? Having a wonderful time, Uncle George. I'll be back to Kansas pretty soon. Professor listens to the radio and shakes his head. GINGER (sultry) Hello, Coast Guard? This is Ginger Grant. I sing and I dance -- and lots of things. Ginger giggles. GILLIGAN "... the pussycat went to sea in a beautiful pea green boat ..." Professor listens to the radio and shakes his head. Mr. and Mrs. Howell enter. MRS HOWELL Thurston! They've all gone mad. MR HOWELL I have never in my entire life -- SKIPPER Don't just stand there, Mister Howell. Talk into a fish. Skipper hands Mr. Howell a fish. Mr. Howell hands the fish to Mrs. Howell. MR HOWELL Talk into it? Skipper hands Mr. Howell another FISH. SKIPPER Talk into the fish. MR HOWELL Good heavens! Hello there. This is Thurston Howell. Yes, I want long distance. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY SKIPPER All right, Gilligan, you can watch. But don't come any closer. Stay right here. GILLIGAN Yes, sir. SKIPPER Professor, I don't know how those fish managed to swallow the radio and the transmitter, but at least we've got a chance again. Skipper sits down next to Professor. SKIPPER (cont'd) How's it coming? PROFESSOR Just give me a little more time, and I think I'll have it working. Gilligan picks up a screwdriver and tries to help. GILLIGAN Maybe if we took this and kinda pried this up-- SKIPPER Give me that screwdriver! Skipper takes the screwdriver from Gilligan. GILLIGAN Skipper, isn't there anything I can do to help? SKIPPER Yes, Gilligan. Get some more wood for the fire. Lots of wood. Gilligan salutes. Skipper salutes. Gilligan walks to leave as Ginger enters. Mary Ann, Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell follow Ginger from the jungle. GINGER How's the Professor doing with the transmitter? GILLIGAN Almost got it fixed. Gilligan exits. Ginger, Mary Ann, Mr. Howell, and Mrs. Howell join around Skipper and Professor as he works on the transmitter. MARY ANN Oh, that's wonderful! MR HOWELL Well, I must say, that is a happy turn of events. You think you could reach my broker? GINGER Or my agent in Hollywood? MARY ANN Can you get in touch with my mother, please? She's in Winfield, Kansas. MRS HOWELL Oh, if you reach your mother, would you ask her to telephone the Bixby-Taylors in Newport? We're expected there for dinner on Tuesday. SKIPPER Please, folks. I think the first thing we should do is get in touch with somebody that has a boat. The radio emits tuning SOUNDS. PROFESSOR Wait a minute. I think it's working. Here, Skipper. Try it. I'll take the radio. SKIPPER Cee cue, come in, cee cue. Cee cue, this is a mayday. Gilligan carries a load of firewood logs. The logs obscure his view. DOLLY BACK to the other castaways listening to the Professor and Skipper attempt to reach civilization by radio. Gilligan drops a few logs of wood. SKIPPER (cont'd) This is a mayday. Calling cee cue. Cee cue, calling cee cue. GILLIGAN Skipper, where can I -- SKIPPER Not now, Gilligan! Stay where you are. Don't come any closer. (to microphone) Cee cue, calling cee cue. GILLIGAN But Skipper, these logs are heavy. SKIPPER Calling cee cue. Cee cue. PROFESSOR I hear it. I hear it. SKIPPER It's beginning to work. The castaways express glee. SKIPPER (cont'd) Quiet, quiet, quiet! Skipper talks slowly and distinctly into the microphone for the transmitter. SKIPPER (cont'd) If anyone can hear me, this is the skipper of the ess ess Minnow. GILLIGAN Where can I put them? SKIPPER (to Gilligan) Just drop them anywhere. (to microphone) This is the Skipper of the -- GILLIGAN Drop them? SKIPPER Drop them! Gilligan drops the logs right where he stands. Gilligan drops the logs on the transmitter, thoroughly wrecking it. Skipper looks disgusted with himself. He looks at Gilligan. Gilligan looks sheepish. Skipper pulls the remains of the transmitter from beneath the pile of logs. Skipper holds up the remains of the transmitter. Gilligan looks down. Skipper shakes his head and almost speaks. Gilligan gestures to Skipper to hold off speaking. GILLIGAN Wait a minute, Skipper. I know what you're gonna say, and you're right. I've been nothing but trouble to everybody. I threw the radio in the ocean. And now I just crushed the transmitter. But I'll make it up to you. Honest. SKIPPER How, Gilligan? Gilligan smiles. GILLIGAN You don't have to pay me for this week's work. Skipper becomes obviously frustrated. Gilligan's smile turns into a sheepish look. END FLASHBACK. RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: EXT. OCEAN BEACH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY The castaways wait for the destroyer with their belongings. SKIPPER Still don't see a thing. GILLIGAN Nothing there. MR HOWELL When we get back, I'll have the entire Navy demoted for this. PROFESSOR Well, perhaps we can get some information on the radio. Professor turns on the radio. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And here's another flash about the exciting rescue of the castaways. A Coast Guard cutter has just picked up all the passengers and crew who were marooned on the tropical island. SKIPPER Picked them up? RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And they're bringing them back to civilization. According to reports they were believed to be survivors from the ess ess Minnow. PROFESSOR Well, It wasn't our island they sighted. SKIPPER It was another island, with other castaways. GINGER Oh, we're not going to be saved. RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) So the happy group that was marooned for eleven years ... MARY ANN Eleven years? RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... are safe and steaming for home aboard the Coast Guard cutter. MRS HOWELL Coast Guard cutter? MR HOWELL We thought it was going to be the Navy, at least. MRS HOWELL Oh, I'm glad they didn't find our island. We're both terribly overdressed. The Howells turn around and exit. GILLIGAN Don't feel so bad. The other group was stranded for eleven years. We could be rescued in ten. Mary Ann glances at Gilligan. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Nine? (pause) Eight? (pause) Seven? (pause) Six? (pause) Five? (pause) Four, three, two, one? FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - SUNSET DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

MARY ANN And we're still on this island. PROFESSOR Yes, I thought sure we'd be home by now. GILLIGAN I'm sorry. MRS HOWELL Aw, Gilligan, it's not your fault. Santa Claus appears from the jungle, RINGING a BELL. SANTA CLAUS Merry, merry Christmas! Ho, Merry Christmas to you all! MR HOWELL Well, thank you, Santa. But would you care to tell us what we have to be merry about? SANTA CLAUS Why, certainly, good sir. After all, you might have been lost at sea and never reached this island. GILLIGAN He's right. SANTA CLAUS That's right. Or you might have hit an island that had no food or water. GINGER That's right, too. SANTA CLAUS Or you might have all been enemies by now instead of the family group that you are, who all learned to get along with each other. MR HOWELL By George, this bearded gentleman is right. SANTA CLAUS That's right, good sir. So remember, and be of good spirit. Merry Christmas to all! Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas! Santa Claus turns and exits into the jungle. Skipper enters carrying a pile of logs. SKIPPER What's everybody looking at? Gilligan is startled by Skipper's entrance. Gilligan stands up and looks at Skipper with his mouth agape. Gilligan and Skipper exchange glances. SKIPPER (cont'd) Well, what's everybody looking at? GILLIGAN You'll never believe it, Skipper. Merry Christmas. Skipper shakes Gilligan's hand while still holding the LOGS. SKIPPER Merry Christmas, Gilligan. Thank you. SKIPPER (cont'd) Merry Christmas! Skipper looks on, puzzled. Gilligan can't believe his eyes. PROFESSOR Merry Christmas, Skipper. SKIPPER Merry Christmas. The sound of SLEIGH BELLS comes from above. MR HOWELL Merry Christmas! Gilligan and Skipper look up to the sky and cannot believe what they see. They exchange glances. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Merry Christmas. GINGER Merry, merry Christmas. MARY ANN Merry Christmas.

MR HOWELL What on Earth are you talking about, Lovey? MRS HOWELL Oh, nothing, dear. Go back to sleep. It's not your fault anyway. MR HOWELL Thank you. Mr. Howell removes the leaf and turns to Mrs. Howell. MR HOWELL (cont'd) What's -- What's not my fault? MRS HOWELL Well, that we're sitting out the entire social season on this silly little island. MR HOWELL You're absolutely right. It's --it‘s not my fault. Mr. Howell flips the leaf back over his face and folds his arms over his chest.

MRS HOWELL Thurston, can't the captain of a ship marry people? Mr. Howell removes the leaf from his face. MR HOWELL Yes, as a matter of fact, he can. Why? Mrs. Howell walks from the window back to the writing desk and sits down. MRS HOWELL Why didn't I think of that before? They're the most perfect match. A little offbeat, of course, but then that's terribly chic. And it's the right season, too. Mr. Howell sits up and turns toward Mrs. Howell. MR HOWELL Lovey, what on earth are you talking about? MRS HOWELL Well, a wedding, of course. I have a thousand things to do. Mrs. Howell makes notes on a writing pad. MR HOWELL If it's not asking too much, whose wedding?

With a bit of encouragement, they could be madly in love. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann sits in the chair and rubs her right ankle. Gilligan kneels before her. MARY ANN Gilligan, you should have told me you set that trap. I might have broken a leg. GILLIGAN Gee, I'm sorry you fell in, Mary Ann. Here, let me rub it and make it better. Gilligan roughly grabs Mary Ann's right leg. Mary Ann throws her head back in discomfort. He releases her leg and she speaks directly to him. Mary Ann rubs her right leg. MARY ANN No, Gilligan, that's all right. What were you trying to catch, anyway? GILLIGAN An anteater. MARY ANN An anteater? Whatever for? GILLIGAN For Ginger, the poor girl. MARY ANN You mean she told you to catch an anteater? GILLIGAN No, the Skipper did. The Skipper said she had ants in her belfry -- wherever that is. So I was gonna help her get rid of them. MARY ANN Gilligan, I'm sure the Skipper said, "Bats in her belfry." Gilligan puzzles over his mistake, turns, and sits on the ground. GILLIGAN Bats? Where am I gonna find a bat-eater? I don't even know what they look like. INT./EXT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY The Howells peer out of the window. MR HOWELL Lovey, don't you get it? Gilligan and Mary Ann haven't shown the slightest romantic inclination toward each other. MRS HOWELL Well, of course not, dear. If they can manage on their own, they wouldn't need me, would they?

Mrs. Howell follows him. To comfort him. MRS HOWELL All right, darling, if you insist. Mrs. Howell removes the leaf from his face and rubs his temples. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) But it would be so easy. First we get them thinking about marriage in general. MR HOWELL No! MRS HOWELL And then we get them thinking about each other. MR HOWELL No. MRS HOWELL Then we get them thinking about the perfect marriage in the flesh. That's us, dear. MR HOWELL No. I mean, yes, yes. MRS HOWELL It would all be so easy. We'll let nature take its course, hmmm? Mrs. Howell wraps her arms around Mr. Howell. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) And then, I'll work on Mary Ann and you work on Gilligan. Mr. Howell sits up and breaks Mrs. Howell's gentle hold. MR HOWELL No! I will have no part of this cold-blooded, nefarious female scheme! EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY Mr. Howell walks through the jungle carrying a solid gold camera in one hand and a riding crop in the other. MR HOWELL Yes, my boy, a man doesn't start living until after he's married. Gilligan appears from the foliage behind Mr. Howell. Gilligan carries a tripod and a flash lamp. GILLIGAN Thanks for a living now, Mister Howell, this stuff must have cost a fortune. MR HOWELL Everything I have costs a fortune, Gilligan, my boy, except this camera. It costs more than a fortune. It's solid gold. It's custom-made. Actually, it's priceless. GILLIGAN It's beautiful. MR HOWELL Well, it's true, I do like the finer things in life. And so could you, my boy. GILLIGAN Oh, I never could be a millionaire. MR HOWELL Ho-ho! Don't sell yourself short, Gilligan. Do you think that I was always healthy, handsome, and wealthy? GILLIGAN Sure. MR HOWELL No! On the contrary, when I was a youth, I was pale, sickly-looking, and inept. Rather like you, my boy. GILLIGAN No kidding? MR HOWELL Yes, I started to go downhill and then I met Lovey, and that woman changed me. She took me, and she hammered me, and she pounded me and she molded me! GILLIGAN That must've hurt. MR HOWELL It's a figure of speech, my boy. Here, take the camera. (hands camera to Gilligan) I want you to take a picture of me next to this rather rare plant for my album, you understand? GILLIGAN Sure thing, Mister Howell. MR HOWELL Remember, behind every famous man there stands a woman. Gilligan frames the shot, but he is too close. He backs up. MR HOWELL MR HOWELL (cont'd) Look at Napoleon and Josephine. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan steps up onto a rock. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Look at Caesar and Cleopatra. Gilligan steps up onto a boulder. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Look where you're going, Gilligan! Gilligan falls off the boulder onto his back on the ground. MR HOWELL MR HOWELL (cont'd) Oh, no. GILLIGAN examines the camera and removes debris from it. The camera back is open, exposing the film. GILLIGAN I think I got your picture. BACK TO SCENE Gilligan brings the camera over to Mr. Howell. The zoom lens is bent. The camera back is off. The camera is effectively damaged beyond repair. MR HOWELL Have you ever seen a grown man cry? It's a frightening sight! Mr. Howell takes the camera, turns, and walks away. Gilligan contemplates his mistake. EXT. CAMP - DAY Mary Ann pedals the stationary bike to power a bamboo sewing machine that Mrs. Howell uses. MARY ANN They're going to be awfully pretty, Missus Howell. MRS HOWELL Thank you, dear. Thurston loves these colorful ascots. MARY ANN Well, you certainly like to please him, don't you? MRS HOWELL It's all I live for. To be a good wife is to be a completely fulfilled woman. You'll find out yourself someday, I hope. MARY ANN Oh, I do, too. I want to get married. MRS HOWELL Of course you do, dear. Every girl your age does. But time goes so fast. MARY ANN Yes, it does, doesn't it? Oh, gee. We could be marooned on this island for years. MRS HOWELL And years and years. Of course, there are eligible bachelors right here. MARY ANN For me? Who? I'm much too young for the Skipper. The Professor and I have nothing in common. Gilligan, well -- ZOOM ON MARY ANN Mary Ann stops pedaling and giggles. MARY ANN (cont'd) Gilligan a husband? FLIP TO: INT. GIRLS HUT - DAY Mary Ann picks up a large bouquet of flowers from her bed and walks over to Ginger. MARY ANN Flowers from Gilligan? Are you sure? GINGER Of course I'm sure. I was here when he put them on the bunk. MARY ANN And he said they were for me? GINGER Mm-hmmm. Don't be so surprised. After all, you're a girl and he's a -- Well, whatever he is, he's kind of cute. MARY ANN Gee, I just -- GINGER Imagine his having a crush on you, and we're just discovering it now. Golly, it reminds me of a movie I was in once. He loved her with a burning passion and she loved him like a flaming fire. It was a good movie. MARY ANN Sounds like a commercial for a gas company. Gilligan opens the door and steps in. GILLIGAN Hi, girls. I just wanted to see if you got the flowers, Mary Ann. Bye. Gilligan exits and closes the door behind him. GINGER See, I told you. Why didn't you say something to him? MARY ANN Oh, I didn't know what to say. GINGER Just be sweet to him. He's a shy, frightened fawn. Just like in the movies. (winks) See you. Ginger opens the door and exits the hut. MARY ANN Flowers. From Gilligan. EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan stands in the camp clearing. Ginger runs over to him. GINGER Gilligan, I just want to say -- don't be fooled by appearances, okay? GILLIGAN Okay. Gilligan turns to leave, but Ginger stops him. GINGER What I mean is -- sometimes a person can't show what they feel. Do you know what I mean? GILLIGAN looks like he's going to nod. GILLIGAN Nope. But he shakes his head. GINGER GINGER Gilligan, try to understand. Sometimes a certain girl feels the same way a certain fellow feels about her -- but she just can't show it. (sultry) Get it? GILLIGAN'S FACE drops. GILLIGAN Oh -- GINGER GINGER I just felt I should say something. GILLIGAN GILLIGAN Well, I'm glad you did, and I'm glad you like me as much as I like you. I'll tell you what. Don't you worry about your belfry. I'll find you that bat-eater. RETURN TO SCENE Gilligan pats Ginger on the shoulder and exits. GINGER Belfry? DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Gilligan stands in front of a mirror and combs his hair. Skipper and Professor stand behind him and watch as he primps. SKIPPER Well, our little buddy here is becoming quite a social lion. PROFESSOR Yes. How come he rates a special invitation to the Howells? Gilligan buttons his shirt and turns toward them. GILLIGAN Missus Howell wanted to thank me for helping her. She picked flowers all morning and had me give them to Mary Ann. SKIPPER Had you give them to Mary Ann? Gilligan tucks his shirt into his trousers. GILLIGAN Uh-huh. She wanted to thank Mary Ann for helping with the sewing. SKIPPER Was there a note? GILLIGAN I don't think so. Why? SKIPPER Well, it's just the idea if you left the flowers for Mary Ann without a note -- she might think that you gave them to her. GILLIGAN Why would she think that? She never helped me with any sewing. PROFESSOR Gilligan, your innocence is exceeded only by your naiveté. Skipper and Professor smile. SKIPPER Well, I must say, little buddy, you've left yourself wide open for a dilly of a misunderstanding. PROFESSOR Yes, many good men have been brought to their knees by a lot less than a bunch of flowers. Right, Skipper? SKIPPER Oh, right, Professor. And say, did you notice this morning the way Mary Ann kept passing him toast? PROFESSOR And yesterday it was the coconut milk. Indicative. Highly indicative. SKIPPER I want to tell you there's no telling what's flying around in that pretty little head. Gilligan puts on his hat. GILLIGAN Well, you guys are trying to put me on. It's not gonna work. Mary Ann doesn't have a crush on me. Ginger does. Their faces drop. Gilligan walks between Skipper and Professor and exits. Skipper and Professor look at each other and then look after Gilligan. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell are dressed in their finest clothes. Gilligan holds his hat in hand. Mrs. Howell shows Gilligan to a dining table. Two small lit candles illuminate the table. Several other candles light the room. MRS HOWELL Oh, Gilligan, come and take this chair. It's the most comfortable. Gilligan sits down in the chair. GILLIGAN Thank you for inviting me over tonight. MR HOWELL Well, it's the least we can do after you helped me this morning. GILLIGAN But I broke your priceless, one-of-a kind, gold camera. Reminded of the incident, Mr. Howell feigns wringing Gilligan's neck. A KNOCK at the door. MR HOWELL Yes, you did, didn't you? Mrs. Howell walks over to the door. MRS HOWELL Oh -- There's someone at the door. Come in. The door opens and Mary Ann enters. She's dressed in her most elegant dress and carries a clutch purse. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Mary Ann, what a surprise! MARY ANN It is? You did ask me over. Mrs. Howell and Mary Ann walk over to the dining table. MRS HOWELL Yes, of course, yes. Gilligan dropped in, too. Isn't that nice? Gilligan holds his hat in his hands. Gilligan politely stands to greet Mary Ann. MARY ANN Hi, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Hi, Mary Ann. MRS HOWELL Ah, now, isn't this cozy? Sit right down here. Gilligan and Mary Ann sit down at the table. MR HOWELL AND MRS HOWELL MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Thurston, haven't we got some champagne cooling in the stream? MR HOWELL One of our last bottles. MRS HOWELL Oh, marvelous! We must get it at once. Mrs. Howell blows out the candle near Mary Ann. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) Now, you two children sit there and chat and we'll be right back. Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell walk to the door. Mrs. Howell pauses to blow out a candle by the door. The room darkens. Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell exit. GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN sit uncomfortably in the silence. After a moment, Gilligan breaks the silence. GILLIGAN Is something bothering you, Mary Ann? MARY ANN Oh, no. No, Gilligan -- I -- Well, I did want to thank you for the flowers. GILLIGAN Oh, I didn't give you those flowers. Missus Howell did. MARY ANN looks disappointed. MARY ANN Missus Howell? Ginger said you left them. GILLIGAN GILLIGAN I did. For Missus Howell. MARY ANN understands. MARY ANN Oh. (pause) I guess I just -- I thought maybe -- GILLIGAN realizes he has a dilly of a misunderstanding. GILLIGAN Oh. Then you mean that you -- MARY ANN GILLIGAN (cont'd) And Ginger was -- GILLIGAN GILLIGAN (cont'd) The guys were right. GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN MARY ANN I guess there's been a little misunderstanding, huh? GILLIGAN Yeah, I guess, uh -- Tell you what, Mary Ann -- Tell you what -- Suddenly very warm, Gilligan unbuttons his shirt collar. GILLIGAN (cont'd) If I was gonna spend all morning picking flowers for someone -- I'd certainly pick those flowers for someone as sweet and nice as you are. MARY ANN Oh, that's an awfully sweet thing to say, Gilligan. GILLIGAN Oh, it was a sweet thing of you to think that of -- MARY ANN Not half as sweet as you. Mary Ann puts her hand on Gilligan's forearm. Gilligan looks down at her hand and becomes more awkward. GILLIGAN Well -- I'm not -- You're twice as sweet as me. INT./EXT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell peer in through their window as they have eavesdropped on Gilligan and Mary Ann's conversation. Mr. Howell holds a bottle of champagne. MR HOWELL (sotto) Heavens to karas, what a conversation. MRS HOWELL (sotto) Things are going swimmingly. MR HOWELL (sotto) They're sweet on each other, I'll say that much. MRS HOWELL (sotto) Thurston, let's show them what real happiness is. Mrs. Howell moves away from the window and Mr. Howell follows her. INT.

Mrs. Howell brings a tray of coconut drinking glasses to the table and sets it down. Mr. Howell pours champagne into the glasses. MRS HOWELL I'm going to tell you children a secret. This is sort of a celebration. Twenty years ago tonight, Mister Howell proposed to me and I accepted. MARY ANN Oh, how beautifully romantic. MRS HOWELL MRS HOWELL Thurston always had a knack for romance. He took me to the most enchanting little restaurant -- the Tour d'Argent. Do you remember, sweetheart? MR HOWELL MR HOWELL Well, how could I forget a prime bit of income property on West ... GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN listen. MR HOWELL (O.S.) ... 47th Street?

MR HOWELL MR HOWELL You must have rented it, because that's what you had on that night. GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN turn from Mr. Howell to Mrs. Howell. MRS HOWELL MRS HOWELL Thurston, you must be remembering somebody else, my darling. GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN turn from Mrs. Howell to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL MR HOWELL No, no, no. I can see her in that red dress, sitting there, clicking her nails. MRS HOWELL MRS HOWELL Clicking my nails? GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN turn from Mrs. Howell to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL MR HOWELL Yes, it's a nervous habit she has of clicking her nails. GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN MARY ANN Uh, shall we make another toast? GILLIGAN Yeah, here is to twenty years of harmony and bliss. Gilligan and Mary Ann raise their classes to toast. BACK TO SCENE MRS HOWELL If I click my nails, it's only to drown out the noise of his sniffing. MR HOWELL I beg your pardon? MRS HOWELL MRS HOWELL I said "sniffing." Twenty years of it! GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN turn from Mrs. Howell to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL MR HOWELL Well, I hadn't --- that it bothered you before. MRS HOWELL MRS HOWELL It doesn't. Not nearly so much as his throat clearing. MR HOWELL MR HOWELL Well, you never spoke of that before. Mr. Howell clears his throat. GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN turn toward Mr. Howell.

GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN GILLIGAN Mister Howell, Mrs. Howell -- MRS HOWELL MRS HOWELL What vulgarity! But what can I expect of a man -- who can't distinguish between his oyster fork and his shrimp fork? MR HOWELL MR HOWELL That did it. That's gone far enough! BACK TO SCENE MRS HOWELL Don't worry. I won't go farther, because I shall never speak to you again. Mrs. Howell puts her coconut glass down on the table, turns away from Mr. Howell, and folds her arms. MR HOWELL Well, as long as we have witnesses, do you mind putting that in writing? Mr. Howell folds his arms. MARY ANN Do something. GILLIGAN Um, yeah, um. (raises his glass) Here's to a perfect marriage. Mary Ann joins him in his toast.

Ginger, will you please pass the coconut milk? BACK TO SCENE GINGER Sure. Ginger passes a coconut milk-filled gourd to Professor, who passes it to Mary Ann. MR HOWELL Gilligan, ...

GINGER What's a few insults when you've been married twenty years? PROFESSOR Besides, whether they even were insults is highly debatable. GINGER Are you kidding? He said that she snored. PROFESSOR You could hardly call that an insult, could you? GINGER Well, I would. PROFESSOR Don't you think that's a bit immature? GINGER No, I think it's an insult. PROFESSOR (smugly) Perhaps that proves my point. GINGER Well, aren't we the smart one? PROFESSOR You needn't take that tone of voice. MARY ANN MARY ANN Frankly, I don't blame her a bit. PROFESSOR AND GINGER PROFESSOR Excuse me. I'm going to finish my meal elsewhere. BACK TO SCENE Professor rises from the table, takes his plate with him, and exits.

SKIPPER Now, what were the Howells doing when they started their fight? GILLIGAN They were trying to show Mary Ann and me how happy they were. SKIPPER No, no, no. GILLIGAN Yes, yes, yes! Because they were celebrating the anniversary of Mister Howell's proposal to Missus Howell. It was in the Tour d'Argent on 47th Street. I remember it all! Ginger appears out of the jungle. GINGER That's right. She was trying to make everything so romantic, the poor dear. SKIPPER Well, that's our answer.

MARY ANN I think my father use to use sand or something to help the drainage.  PROFESSOR That's a good idea.  Plenty of sand at the lagoon.  Both Mary Ann and the professor take a look at Gilligan.  Gilligan starts to laugh in disbelief.  MARY ANN Gilligan.  GILLIGAN AH look, I did all the weeding, and the planting, and the watering and everything!  PROFESSOR An excellent job at that!  MARY ANN Oh and we do need the sand.  GILLIGAN Ok, but I bet your father didn't grow anything on his farm of his!  MARY ANN He DID too!  GILLIGAN How could he, I wasn't there to do all the work!  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY  Gilligan is gathering up sand for the garden.  He's using the lid of the crate to scrape sand into a bucket. We see the "Danger" printing clearly on the lid.  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - GARDEN - DAY  Gilligan can be seen clearly by a rock, but what he's working can not be. The skipper approaches to check on the gardens progress.  SKIPPER Gilligan are you almost finished?  GILLIGAN Almost.  The skipper finally sees what Gilligan has been working on.  SKIPPER A SAND castle!?  GILLIGAN I had some extra sand.  SKIPPER Looks like I'm wasting my time trying to mold YOUR character.  GILLIGAN Is that what you're trying to do?  SKIPPER Why certainly Gilligan.  Why do you suppose I have you chop the wood, bring up water, pick up coconuts and work on the farm?  I'm trying to strengthen your character.  I'm trying to make you officer material.   GILLIGAN Me an officer!? That's impossible!  SKIPPER Why?  GILLIGAN I'm too busy being the whole crew!  SKIPPER Spread the sand Gilligan!  You just don't underst...  Gilligan throws sand all over the skipper.  SKIPPER OVER THERE!  DISSOLVE TO: SHOT OF MORNING SUNRISE OVER THE OCEAN THROUGH SOME PALM TREES  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - GARDEN - DAY  Three days later.  We see the plants in the garden growing at a fantastic rate. Gilligan walks on camera holding a watering can made from bamboo. HE proceeds along the garden rows watering as he goes. He turns around only to see that the vegetables have grown to almost full size.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper, Professor Mary Ann!  PROFESSOR What's the matter!  GILLIGAN The spinach is growing!  PROFESSOR Oh that's impossible!  GILLIGAN It is? Look!  PROFESSOR Oh we only planted it three days ago!  MARY ANN Gilligan what's the matter?  GILLIGAN The Spinach is growing!  MARY ANN Well it can't be!  It takes at... Professor!  PROFESSOR They look like Spinach plants.  MARY ANN Well the Carrots are they coming up too?  GILLIGAN Are they!  Look!  MARY ANN Oh, oh, the Carrots aren’t they beautiful!?  SKIPPER Is...is something wrong little buddy?  GILLIGAN Nothings wrong, everything's perfect!  PROFESSOR Well it seems that our vegetables have not only taken root, but they've begun to grow at a most miraculous rate!  MARY ANN Well just look they're popping up all over the place!  SKIPPER Little buddy I want to complement you.  GILLIGAN Thanks skipper.  SKIPPER You've really done a fine job. Put're there pal!  The skipper shakes Gilligan's hand as Gilligan ends up pouring water from a watering can, all over the skipper's shoes.  SKIPPER GIVE me this Gilligan!  The skipper takes the watering can from Gilligan and dunks it in the water barrel to fill it up.  He then raises Gilligan's head enough so he can place the nozzle of the can down the front of Gilligan's shirt. He fills up Gilligan's shirt until the point where Gilligan appears almost pregnant.  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - GARDEN - DAY  We see Mr. and Mrs. Howell examining the garden.  MR HOWELL Oh look Lovey...Lovey look, look the...the Mushrooms are...are mushing!  MRS HOWELL Yes, but the Beets are beating them.  MR HOWELL Oh you had a witty one!  MRS HOWELL Oh thank you dear!  MR HOWELL Pretty soon the vegetables will be ready. Gilligan will pick them.  Mary Ann will clean them, and Ginger will prepare them.  MRS HOWELL Yes, but on second thought, oughtn't we do something?  MR HOWELL Oh perish the thought!  Every Hive must have a Queen, the rest are workers.  MRS HOWELL Yes but I feel a little guilty.  Maybe we should make some kind of an effort.  MR HOWELL Ah, what do you suggest?  MRS HOWELL Well ah...we could be a, host and hostess at a dinner party!  MR HOWELL A vegetarian do!  FLIP TO: EXT - GARDEN - DAY  Mary Ann is examining the garden when she pulls a very strange looking carrot out of the ground.  The carrot appears to have a large body with four carrots sticking out.  MARY ANN I never saw anything like this back on our farm!  Except under a cow!  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Everyone is standing around the table.  There are a large number of strange vegetables covering the table. The castaways are all astounded at what they see.  MARY ANN Strange looking vegetables!  What are these?  GILLIGAN Cucumbers I think.  MARY ANN Oh and what's this funny looking thing...corn?  We see what appears to be a circular ear of corn.  SKIPPER Well I...I...I guess that this is budget corn Mary Ann.  MARY ANN Budget corn?  The skipper places the ring of corn over his head.  SKIPPER Yes, a, making both ends meet!  A vegetarians delight!  GILLIGAN They sure are funny looking!  SKIPPER Well who cares what they look like.  We've got fresh vegetables!  PROFESSOR Perhaps being submerged in salt water has had an effect on the seeds.  MARY ANN If my father ever saw string beans like this I think he'd faint!  GILLIGAN They look more like Pretzel beans.  SKIPPER Pretzels...Oh if we only had some beer to go with them!  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Everyone is seated at the table.  On the table are a wide variety of vegetables in bowls and plates.  There is a lot of conversation going on that appears to be ad lib.  GILLIGAN Skipper, pass the spinach please.  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan that's the forth helping of spinach you've had!  GILLIGAN Sixth, I snuck two.  MR HOWELL Ah...Ah Ginger, would you please pass the Artichokes my dear.  GINGER Oh sure Mr. Howell, do you like them?  MR HOWELL Thank you.  The way you prepared them reminds me of my chef Herman.  The ONLY thing about you that reminds me of my chef Herman!  Everyone is asking for their favorite vegetables.  SKIPPER Professor, please the a, string beans.  MARY ANN Mrs. Howell please pass the carrots.  MRS HOWELL Oh yes of course dear.  MARY ANN Oh we don't grow carrots like this back home.  PROFESSOR I never realized how much I missed vegetables until now.  GINGER I think the two things that I miss the most are, are vegetables and dates.  GILLIGAN We have plenty of dates here on the island.  GINGER Not the kind I miss.  SKIPPER Professor, please the a, the string beans?   MR HOWELL Would you ah...may I have the Artichokes?  PROFESSOR Since we all seem to have our favorite vegetables, lets move them near us.  GILLIGAN Spinach next to me.  MARY ANN Oh the carrots please.   MRS HOWELL Oh I just love beets, I want the beets!  I adore sugar beets!  Everyone is talking with each other about passing the vegetables.  They are still dishing up vegetables and having a great time.  The radio has been playing music in the back ground when all of a sudden the radio announcer starts to speak of the seeds.  RADIO ANNOUNCER WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM FOR A NEWS BULLETIN FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURAL LABRATORIES IN HAWAII.  IT SEEMS THAT A BOX CONTAINING RADIOACTIVE SEEDS IS MISSING.  PROFESSOR SHHHHHHH everyone, I think he said something about seeds!  Everyone gets completely quiet.  RADIO ANNOUNCER THE VEGETABLE SEEDS WERE IN A SMALL WOODEN CRATE AND INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED.  THESE RADIOACTIVE SEEDS ARE OF AN EXPERIMENTAL NATURE AND CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.  THE BOX IS CLEARLY LABELED, DANGER, EXPERIMENTAL, RADIOACTIVE.  ON THE CHANCE THEY DID NOT FALL OVERBOARD, ANYONE FINDING THEM OR KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM, PLEASE CONTACT THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT IN HAWAII.  LET ME REPEAT.  THE SEEDS ARE RADIOACTIVE AND CONSIDERED EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  NOW BACK TO OUR PROGRAM OF CHEERY DAYTIME TUNES.  The professor leans over and turns off the radio.  GINGER Professor, do you suppose that?  PROFESSOR Well he did say that the crate was clearly labeled.  SKIPPER Well...we...we...well when Gilligan showed us the crate it didn't have a cover on it did it.  GILLIGAN I took the cover off.  PROFESSOR Do you know where it is?  Gilligan gets up and picks up his chair as he says:  GILLIGAN Made it into this bench right here.  He lifts it up and we clearly see the DANGER label.  GILLIGAN Nothing there, see!  FADE OUT:   ACT TWO FADE IN:  ESTABLISHING SHOT: A SET OF PALM TREES WAVING IN THE WIND  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Everyone except the professor is seated around the table.  The professor is standing at the head of the table referring to a book he's holding.  The camera slowly zooms in for a professor only close-up as he speaks.  PROFESSOR ...Course this book is dated.  It doesn't contain much information about the consumption of radioactive food.  However, it does say that it's entirely possible that it could be fatal.  But on the other hand it doesn't say it MUST be fatal.  So you see there's no...  The camera pulls back to reveal that all but the professor as fainted.  PROFESSOR Now what could I have said to make them faint?  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan is in the upper hammock and the skipper is in the lower one.  The professor is seated at a table still reading his book and looking perplexed.  SKIPPER Gilligan are you frightened?  GILLIGAN No.  SKIPPER Your not!?  GILLIGAN I'm too scared to be frightened.  The professor suddenly realizes something as he continues to read his book.  PROFESSOR How dumb can I be!?  SKIPPER Dumb?  Well you're the smartest man I ever knew!  PROFESSOR How could I be so stupid!? Of all the dumb...  SKIPPER Well professor a, don't call yourself dumb just cause you can't find a cure for this disease.  PROFESSOR We're doing the wrong thing!  Lying still could kill us!  We should be moving around!  At hearing this, Gilligan and the skipper jump out of their hammocks and start a frantic race for the door. The professor leads the two out of the hut while Gilligan and the skipper continue their unorganized departure.  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY  We see Mary Ann and the skipper near the edge of the lagoon pacing back and for.  Mary Ann is looking tired.  MARY ANN Oh skipper I've got to sit down I'm exhausted!  SKIPPER Don't sit down Mary Ann, come on now.  Don't you remember the professor said to keep our...our blood circulating, otherwise that radioactive stuff will settle in one place! Now come on!  MARY ANN But I'm tired!  After all I haven't got your legs!  SKIPPER Well...we...well it's a good thing you haven't Mary Ann other wise you couldn't get in those shorts.  Mary Ann suddenly looks up in amazement as she looks out at the ocean.  MARY ANN Skipper a boat look!  SKIPPER Where!?  MARY ANN Over there!  INSERT: SHOT OF OCEAN THROUGH THE PALM TREES.  SKIPPER Where!? I don't see anything.  MARY ANN It's white with blue trim and...and has a bridge or something covered in glass and a lifeboat hanging on the end.  SKIPPER Are you sure!?  I don't see anything. Mary Ann are you all right?  MARY ANN Oh I'm feeling fi... Oh skipper I'm not seeing things!  There's a boat right over there!  SKIPPER Professor!  Quick!  Mary Ann I think that radioactive stuff is making you see things!  Professor!  Quick! Come on Mary Ann!  DISOLVE TO: EXT-HUT-DAY  Mary Ann and the skipper come running on camera from the lagoon looking for the professor.  SKIPPER Professor!  Professor!  PROFESSOR What's the matter!?  SKIPPER Where's...Oh there you are.  Mary Ann sees a boat out there.   MARY ANN It's white with blue trim.  INSERT: SHOT OF THE OCEAN THROUGH THE PALM TREES  PROFESSOR But I don't see anything out there but water Mary Ann.  MARY ANN I can even see the people on the deck! Oh...there's a man in a red and white-stripped tee shirt.  Another man in a, in a blue shirt and blue slacks, and two beautiful women in bikinis.  SKIPPER OH I wish I could see that!  PROFESSOR But I don't see anything out there.  MARY ANN I know I'm not imagining it!  Why, it's just as plain as your book over there.  PROFESSOR You can see my book?  MARY ANN Well of course!  It's on the stump.  ON the hill!  PROFESSOR But that's a half a mile away!  MARY ANN It's ah, turned to page one seventeen, some sort of chemical equation...hree N O two plus H two O equals two H N O three plus N O.  PROFESSOR Well that's incredible!  SKIPPER Well but professor, if she can see the book...maybe there is a boat out there!  MARY ANN Why would I say there was a boat out there if there wasn't?  PROFESSOR Well keep your eye on the boat just in case. Come on skipper, let's go build a signal fire!  Mary Ann starts to try and signal the boat with yelling and waving her arms.  MARY ANN OVER HERE!  Oh come over here!  SKIPPER Boy professor, what a great time to be rescued.  Now they can take us to the hospital and, and we can get cured of the radioactive whatchamacallit what ever it is.  PROFESSOR Skipper that's it!  That's the reason for her fantastic eyesight!  SKIPPER What are you talking about?  PROFESSOR Well Mary Ann ate those carrots.  Now the radioactive treatment of those seeds must have magnified the Carotene!  SKIPPER Carotene?  PROFESSOR Well that's the chemical in carrots that's necessary for good eyesight!  SKIPPER Well then that proves that she saw that boat out there!  Come on let's get this fire started.  GILLIGAN!  GILLIGAN!  Gilligan comes running on camera from behind the hut.  GILLIGAN What are you doing?  SKIPPER Well obviously Gilligan we're building a fire.   GILLIGAN For a merit badge huh?  SKIPPER No not for a merit badge!  We're trying to signal that boat out there!  GILLIGAN What boat?  INSERT: SHOT OF OCEAN THROUGH THE PALM TREES  SKIPPER The boat out there!  GILLIGAN I don't see any boat.  SKIPPER Of course you don't.  GILLIGAN Do you?  SKIPPER No!  GILLIGAN Professor do you see the boat?  PROFESSOR Oh I can't see it either.  GILLIGAN But it's out there right?  SKIPPER Look, Mary Ann saw the boat out there.  GILLIGAN Can you see Mary Ann?  SKIPPER No, how can I see Mary Ann when she's not even here?  GILLIGAN The same way you can see the boat.  SKIPPER Gilligan will stop that!  Will you go get some firewood for the fire?  GILLIGAN To signal the boat that we can't see right?  SKIPPER Exactly!  GILLIGAN Professor, what kind of boat is it we can't see?  PROFESSOR Ah...white with blue trim, and it's got two men and two women on it.  SKIPPER Yah and the women are wearing bikinis!  GILLIGAN OOOOOO I wish I could see them...even if they're not there!  SKIPPER For the last time Gilligan, will you get over to that tree and get some fire wood for the fire!?  GILLIGAN I have a better idea!  SKIPPER What!?  GILLIGAN Since we're make believing there's a boat, let's make believe we have a fire!  SKIPPER GILLIGAN!!  GILLIGAN I'm going.  You don't have to yell.  SKIPPER YES I DO! Now will you get the firewood!?  CUT TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is seen walking on camera and over to a fallen tree.  We see Gilligan ponder what to do as he grabs the tree by a large branch and lifts the entire tree off the ground to his amazement.   The skipper looks up and sees what Gilligan is doing in amazement.  GILLIGAN Skipper?  Where do you want it?  SKIPPER Professor!  The skipper and the professor walk off camera and over to where Gilligan is.  SKIPPER Gilligan little buddy how did you pick that tree up!?  GILLIGAN With one hand!  SKIPPER Wha...well it must be hollow!  PROFESSOR Well it must weigh four or five hundred pounds!  SKIPPER Oh that's ridiculous professor.  If it weighed four or five hundred pounds he couldn't lift it up!  Skipper tries to pick up the tree by the same branch that Gilligan used and can't seem to budge the tree.  SKIPPER I can't budge it!  Gilligan, how did you do that!?  PROFESSOR Spinach, the spinach, Gilligan kept eating the spinach.  The radioactive treatment of the seeds must have magnified the potency of the oxalic minerals.  That's how you get strength from eating spinach!  SKIPPER Well right now let's worry about that boat out there!  Gilligan since you're so strong, break off those branches and get the fire going real good!   Gilligan breaks off a few of the branches and is looking rather smug about it.  SKIPPER All right Gilligan now will you stop playing games and put it on the fire!  MARY ANN Oh you can forget about the fire, the boats gone.  SKIPPER Gilligan this is all your fault!  IF you hadn't found that crate of seeds out there!  PROFESSOR Now hold it skipper, hold it.  We were all excited about finding those seeds, and he didn't know they were contaminated.  SKIPPER Of course your right professor, I'm sorry little buddy, forgive me...  The skipper starts to shake Gilligan's hand and Gilligan's extra strength starts to show.  SKIPPER Gilligan will you let go!  You're crushing my hand!  MARY ANN What's happened?  PROFESSOR Well it's those radioactive vegetables Mary Ann.  They've given you fantastic eyesight and Gilligan super power.  Well the potentials are unlimited.  Why the increase in the potency of the vitamins alone could make us healthier than we ever were before.  SKIPPER Yes if they don't kill us first!  GILLIGAN Yah we'll be the healthiest dead people around.  PROFESSOR Mrs. Howell!?  MARY ANN What about her?  PROFESSOR Well she kept eating those sugar beets.  SKIPPER Well so what.  PROFESSOR Well sugar is energy.  I wonder what effect it's had on her?  CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Mrs. Howell is seen moving at twice a person's normal speed as she moves around the hut.  She's putting things away and making beds etc.  MR HOWELL Lovey what has happened to you?  Lovey slow down!  I'm exhausted just watching you!  At least take a coffee break!  MRS HOWELL Good idea!  Mrs. Howell sits for just a moment and has some more sugar beets to eat.  She gets up and races out the door.  Mr. Howell follows her to the door in amazement.  MR HOWELL I may enter that woman in the Olympics.  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan is seen holding the skipper up who is laying in a lounge chair.  Gilligan appears to be exercising using the skipper as his weights.  SKIPPER Hey Gilligan would you mind putting me down. I'm getting thirsty, I'd like to get something to drink.  Gilligan puts the skipper back down on the ground.  SKIPPER Thank you little buddy.  Say, what about you? You've been doing all the exercise, aren’t you thirsty?  GILLIGAN Oh yah!  I'll go get us some coconut milk.  SKIPPER Fine.   Gilligan goes to a table with coconuts and picks one, which promptly is crushed.  SKIPPER Gilligan you're a walking disaster area.  You've got to learn to be careful.  Now pick up a coconut, but be gentle.  Gilligan picks up another coconut, this time without breaking it.  SKIPPER There...see, that's much better, now just toss it over here Gilligan.  Gilligan tosses the coconut, but way too hard and it sails past the skipper's head and right through the wall of the hut he's sitting next to.  SKIPPER Gilligan I told you to be careful!  GILLIGAN I'll fix it skipper.  Gilligan runs over to the hut to fix the hole.  SKIPPER NO Gilligan don't touch it!  It's too late. Gilligan has now torn an even larger hole in the hut wall.  PROFESSOR Skipper!  Skipper!  Gilligan!    SKIPPER Wa...wa...what's happened!?  PROFESSOR I think I've found a cure for us!  SKIPPER Wa...Great!  GILLIGAN YAH!  PROFESSOR I've applied the principles of theoretic chemistry to the problem of radioactivity. Now the best preventative for the internal bombardment of radioactive particles is through their containment by hydrocarbons.  GILLIGAN Would you mind repeating that?  PROFESSOR Not at all.  I've applied the principals of theoretic chemistry to the problem of radioactivity.  SKIPPER Oh come on professor, never mind all the scientific lingo.  What are you trying to tell us?  PROFESSOR That our best protection against the vegetables we've eaten is through hydrocar... well that is to say through plant fats.  And the best source of plant fat is the soap we've been making here on the island.  GILLIGAN Do you mean we have to take a bath with that soap?  PROFESSOR No we shall have to consume it internally.  GILLIGAN Oh thank goodness.  For a minute there I thought we were going to have to eat it!   FLIP TO: INT - HUT - DAY  We see everyone seated at the table with a plate of what appears to be cheese on it, but in fact are bars of soap.  GINGER Do we really have to eat soap professor?  PROFESSOR Absolutely!  GILLIGAN It seems a shame to wash out my mouth with soap when I didn't say anything bad.  SKIPPER Gilligan, you are going to eat a piece of soap and I'm going to sit here and see that you do!  Now take a piece of soap!  All right now, start eating!  Gilligan...eat!  GILLIGAN This stuff just tastes awful!  SKIPPER Never mind that Gilligan, just do as the professor says.  As they continue to eat the soap, large quantities of bubbles are coming out of everyone's mouths.  MARY ANN OH!  Just call me bubbles!  GINGER OH MY GOODNESS!  This could be the start of a whole new career!  Ginger Grant, bubble dancer!  PROFESSOR It's working, the hydrocarbons are absorbing the radioactivity!  Keep eating!   GILLIGAN When's this going to stop!  PROFESSOR Everything's going to be all right!  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY   The camera pulls back to reveal the hut and soap bubbles floating all over the place. The castaways can be heard laughing and talking amongst them selves.  FADE OUT:  EPILOG FADE IN: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Gilligan is lying in the top hammock as the skipper works on the door of the hut.  SKIPPER Gilligan, the professor said we're all cured. Isn't that good news?  GILLIGAN Yah, but that soap didn't taste bad after you got use to it.  SKIPPER Oh I thought it tasted awful!  Gilligan is seen sneaking a bite of the soap and hiding it from the skipper.  GILLIGAN Mmmm, I thought it tasted good.  SKIPPER Gilligan, are you eating something?  GILLIGAN Me?  SKIPPER Your not eating...your not eating anymore of that soap!?  GILLIGAN What ever gave you that..Hip..Hip..Hip..  As Gilligan hiccups a giant bubble forms.  SKIPPER Gilligan!  Gilligan?  The giant bubble that was forming as Gilligan hiccuped is getting bigger.  The skipper places his fingers in his ears just before the bubble finally explodes with a loud boom!   FADE OUT: END CREDITS  
Episode #78, "Topsy-Turvy" Gilligan bumps his head and sees everything upside down. Professor tries to help, but then he sees double, triple, ect... He then sees head hunters.   GILLIGAN'S ISLAND  "Topsy-Turvy"  By  Elroy Schwartz   November 14, 1966   TEASER  FADE IN:  EXT - LAGOON - DAY - CREDIT OVERLAY  SLOW PAN RIGHT TO: NORTH BEACH AREA OF LAGOON  The skipper, professor and Gilligan are seen walking along a path near the lagoon. The drums of a native tribe can be heard in the background as they walk off camera  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  The three are making there way through the jungle as the drums continue.  PAN RIGHT WITH SKIPPER TO CAVE ENTERANCE  The skipper leads the professor and Gilligan to a cave entrance.  SKIPPER Here's the cave I was telling you about!  The professor and Gilligan take a look into the cave.  PROFESSOR Ah, you are right! It is big enough for all seven of us.  SKIPPER That's right! And food, and a big water supply and everything!  Gilligan leans into the cave and calls.  GILLIGAN Anybody home!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR, GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  ECHO Home, home…home…  SKIPPER Will you stop fooling around! Those headhunters are getting closer every minute!  GILLIGAN Those headhunters really cut off your head?  PROFESSOR Yes, they cut them off, they shrink them and they put them on the ends of sticks!  GILLIGAN Ooo what crazy canes! I'm going to get out of here! They're not going to take me without a chase!  Gilligan starts to go into the cave as the skipper grabs his arm and pulls him back.  SKIPPER We need some bamboo for weapons. Some spears and clubs and everything, now go get some!  GILLIGAN Aye, aye sir!  CUT TO WIDE SHOT - GROUP  Gilligan starts to run and doesn't see a low branch in his way. Just as he's about to hit the branch we…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN HITTING TREE BRANCH  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan is knocked to the ground.  Gilligan looks a bit dazed after hitting the tree.  The skipper and professor move over to Gilligan.  SKIPPER Gilligan you don't have to try and knock your own head off. The natives'll do it for ya!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN ON GROUND  GILLIGAN First it was day and then it was night, and then it was day, and then it was night.  Gilligan looks up as we…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR (INVERTED)  We see what Gilligan sees. The skipper and professor are standing over Gilligan, but are upside down.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is confused at what he sees.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND SKIPPER  SKIPPER What's the matter Gilligan?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN How come you two guys are upside down?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND SKIPPER  The skipper and professor glance at each other with a confused look.  SKIPPER Upside down!? What are you talking about!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  He's squinting and trying to see straight.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY (INVERTED)  PAN LEFT VIEW OF INVERTED JUNGLE  GILLIGAN (O.S.) How come…the whole world is upside down!?  As Gilligan observes his new upside down world we…   FADE OUT      ACT ONE  FADE IN: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  WIDE SHOT  The professor and skipper are seen helping Gilligan walk to the communal table outside the skipper and Gilligan's hut. Gilligan is having trouble walking because of his vision as he makes his way to the table  PROFESSOR I've got my medical book in the supply hut. I'll see if there's a cure for your condition.  ZOOM IN FOR CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  The professor walks off screen towards the supply hut.  GILLIGAN Yeah, please hurry! Seeing everything upside down…  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE - PROFESSOR WALKING TOWARDS HUT (INVERTED)  (CONTINUED) (O.S.) …makes me awful dizzy.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  SKIPPER What a time for this to happen when all those headhunters closing in.  GILLIGAN Yeah, they'll probably mix up and cut off my feet!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  SKIPPER Here Gilligan take it easy now, just lean against the table.  GILLIGAN Yeah, thanks skipper.  SKIPPER I'm sorry I'm gonna have to leave you little buddy, but I got to make some spears.  GILLIGAN Ok, I'll help you.  Gilligan tries to walk with the skipper and staggers around in a circle. The skipper grabs Gilligan by the arms and gets him back to the table.  SKIPPER Get over here and just sit down at the table now.  GILLIGAN Yeah.  Gilligan sits down on one of the table's benches.  SKIPPER Wait until the professor comes back with something to fix you.  GILLIGAN I better be care, I almost fell up!  SKIPPER Ah…well…yes…all right stay right there.  The skipper walks off camera as Gilligan remains at the table.  ZOOM IN FOR CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan looks off camera.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE - MEDIUM SHOT (INVERTED)  We see an upside down view of Ginger walking into the clearing from off camera.  GINGER Gilligan have you seen Mary Ann?  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan looks surprised and covers his eyes with his hand.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE - MEDIUM SHOT  We see a normal view of Ginger approaching.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan still has his eyes covered as Ginger walks on camera.  GINGER Those drums keep getting louder and louder and skipper wants fresh water for the cave and why do you have your eyes close??  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Cause I'm afraid to open them.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER Gilligan, closing your eyes won't make those headhunters go away!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN That's not what I'm afraid of.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER Then why have you got your eyes close?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan looks between his fingers as we…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER (INVERTED)  We see Ginger upside down.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Cause you're standing upside down and I'm afraid your dress might fall up!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GINGER  GINGER Gilligan that's ridiculous!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan looks at Ginger again through his fingers.   GILLIGAN Hey you're right! It's staying there.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND GINGER  GINGER This is no time to be playing games. Those headhunters could be here any minute!  GILLIGAN It's not a game! You see I was running along and I…and I hit my head against a branch of a tree…  GINGER Oh I don't have time to listen to you, I've got to find Mary Ann!  Ginger turns and runs off camera as we…  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GINGER (INVERTED)  We see Ginger running upside down and off camera.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN For a girl, she runs pretty good on her head!  CUT TO: INT - MR AND MRS HOWELL'S HUT - DAY  We see Mrs. Howell sitting at her table trying on a couple of hats as Mr. Howell, who's dress in a fencing outfit, waves a sword around as he battles an imaginary foe. He goes about stabbing everything in sight as he fights.  MR HOWELL Back you headhunters! You fight very well senior but not well enough for the Count of Monte Cristo! HAhh! Hiee! Ha…ha caught you sneaking up me! Ha!! Ha! HA!!  MRS HOWELL Thurston be careful with that thing!  MR HOWELL Well I'm protecting you from the evil headhunters my dear.  Mr. Howell strikes his sword into one of his trunks and it gets stuck. He works at getting it out.  MR HOWELL My darling, exactly what ever are you doing!?  MRS HOWELL Well if I'm going to have my head hanging on a wall, I want it to be properly quaffered and chapeaued.  MR HOWELL Don't worry my dear, they'll never touch a hair on your head!  MRS HOWELL Yes but the professor said…  MR HOWELL Bah humbug what the professor said! Just put your trust in me faithful…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR HOWELL  (CONTINUED …sword!  Mr. Howell in a gallant display, flexes his sword, which promptly breaks, changing his mood.  PULL BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  MR HOWELL Exactly, what DID the professor say?  MRS HOWELL Well he said, that our only chance for survival, was to hide in a cave.  MR HOWELL Oh good heavens, it took generations of breeding to get the Howell's OUT of a cave!  MRS HOWELL Unless of course you want to sit down and reason with them.  MR HOWELL My dear you reason with men at the Harvard club, not with men who carry clubs.  MRS HOWELL You know I understand that they become quite child like, if you offer them a few trinkets.  MR HOWELL My dear you're absolutely brilliant! Just dazzle them with your diamonds my dear!  MRS HOWELL Oh no darling not diamonds! Natives like rhinestones!  MR HOWELL The aborigines will never know that they're real!

PAN RIGHT WITH PROFESSOR TO GILLIGAN AND MARY ANN  Gilligan is still seated at the table while looks on.  PROFESSOR Gilligan, you're a very lucky young man!  GILLIGAN Lucky!?  PROFESSOR Yes, there's a berry that grows in this part of the Pacific that has remarkable curative properties for optic disorders.  GILLIGAN Well it's bad enough having eye trouble, now I have Optic disorders.  MARY ANN Gilligan it's the same thing!  PROFESSOR The Captibora berry may be the cure for your condition.  GILLIGAN I'll eat anything if it helps.  PROFESSOR Now there are a variety of Captibora plants here on the island. But I want only the red berries with the green dots.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN  PROFESSOR So we must all make sure we pick the right ones.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is squinting and twisting his head in an effort to see the professor better.  MARY ANN (O.S.) You mean we all have to go out and pick them?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN (INVERTED)  PROFESSOR Yes.  MARY ANN Oh Gilligan I'm awfully fond of you but, I'm not going out in the jungle alone! Not while those drums are beating.  Suddenly, the drums stop.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN What drums?  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  MARY ANN The ones that are going…  PROFESSOR They stopped!  MARY ANN We're saved!  GILLIGAN No headhunters!?  PROFESSOR Well they only attack to the beating of the Tom Toms. And since we don't hear a drum beat it follows that we have nothing to fear!  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - DAY  CLOSE UP OF NATIVE DRUM  The drum has a hole in it and there is a drumstick stuck in the hole. A native pulls the drumstick from the hole as we…  PULL BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  We see a native war party on the shore of the lagoon. One of the natives holds the drum while the others look on.

MARY ANN Nothing! Absolutely nothing around here!  Behind Mary Ann we see a  native watching her from a high mound.  MARY ANN Poor Gilligan, sure glad I don't have his problem.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF NATIVE  He's raising his machete as he's about to attack.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP MARY ANN  GINGER (O.S.) Mary Ann, I think I found some!  Mary Ann looks off camera in Ginger's direction.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF NATIVE  The Native jumps off screen as we…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN  Mary Ann moves just in time, and the native is seen landing behind her as he misses his mark.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY - NEW AREA  MEDIUM SHOT OF GINGER  Ginger is seen near a plant with berries. Mary Ann walks on camera to where Ginger is.  GINGER Is it?  MARY ANN Oh no they have to have green dots on 'em.  GINGER Oh I'm exhausted.  MARY ANN Well at least we don't have any headhunters to worry about.  A couple of natives are seen popping up some distance behind the girls as they watch from some bushes.  GINGER Do you think there really every were any headhunters?  MARY ANN Well the professor thought so.  GINGER Well that's because he heard the drumbeats, but we never actually saw one.  The natives drop back down out of sight. The girls start walking towards the camera.  PULL BACK WITH GINGER AND MARY ANN  MARY ANN I know but back in Kansas the farmers have a saying, it's the wolf you DON'T see, that's the one you have to worry about. Oh but you don't come from a farm so I guess you don't know anything about wolves.  GINGER Are you kidding!? I come from Hollywood!  MARY ANN Let's concentrate on find some more Captibora berries.  GINGER That name. The cure sounds worse than the dieses.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF NATIVES  A twig snaps and the natives duck out of sight.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GINGER AND MARY ANN  The girls hear the twig snap as the natives were creeping up on them.  GINGER Did you say something?  MARY ANN No.  The natives are poised for the attack when…  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Mary Ann! Ginger! I found some of the berries!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF NATIVES  The natives decide to attack and run off camera towards the girls.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE ON MARY ANN AND GINGER  MEDIUM SHOT - ANGLE DOWN  The girls are heading out of the clearing and towards the professor. They move just in time as the natives are seen leaping onto the ground, missing the girls by just inches.  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is still sitting at the table waiting for the professor to return. He's staring intently at his wristwatch trying to see what time it is.  GILLIGAN I can't tell if it's a quarter to three or, half past nine. Who cares I'm hungry anyway.  Gilligan is still seeing upside down and is twisting his head around looking for something to eat.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF PAPAYA TREE (INVERTED)  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  GILLIGAN It's hard to tell, but I think that's a Papaya tree. Yeah.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan gets up from the table.  GILLIGAN Maybe I'll do better if I close my eyes.  He starts walking towards the tree and off camera.  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE  Gilligan makes it to the tree. In the background we see a native watching Gilligan. He makes his way towards Gilligan and stands behind him ready to swing his machete. Gilligan picks a papaya from the tree. Just as the native swings his machete, Gilligan drops the Papaya and bends down to pick it up. The native's machete gets stuck in the tree.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN ON GROUND  Gilligan is seen picking up the Papaya and crawling away off screen.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The native un-sticks his machete and heads over in Gilligan's direction.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN ON GROUND  Gilligan, still crawling, makes it back to a chair near the table. He pulls himself up to the table and sits down. While Gilligan is fishing in is pocket for his knife, the native walks on camera and stands behind him.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF NATIVE  The native raises his machete and starts to swing.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN AND NATIVE  Just as the native swings his machete, Gilligan drops his knife and bends over to pick it up.  QUICK CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN ON GROUND  Gilligan grabs for his knife.  QUICK CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The native follows through with is swing, and cuts the papaya in half instead.  MR HOWELL (O.S.) Gilligan! Gilligan are you around boy!?  The native hears Mr. Howell, un-sticks his machete and flees back into the bushes. Gilligan rises up from under the table after hearing Mr. Howell.  GILLIGAN Over here Mr. Howell!  Gilligan see the cut Papaya on the table and looks surprised.  GILLIGAN I don't remember cutting that in half?  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE - HUT CLEARING - MEDIUM SHOT  Mr. and Mrs. Howell walk on camera from out of the jungle.

CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Once again Gilligan is squinting and twisting his head in order to see the Howell's better.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL (INVERTED)  We see the Howell's as Gilligan does, upside down. The Howell's notice Gilligan staring strangely at them.  MR HOWELL Gilligan my boy do you have bursitis?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN No I see everything upside down.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  MRS HOWELL How nice!

Gilligan twists around in his chair and leans backwards on the table so his he can see upside down.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL (NORMAL)  We see the Howell's now right side up.  MRS HOWELL You know dear I think he's trying to tell us something.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I'm trying to tell you a lot of things. A…a I see everything upside down, the drums have stopped, so there's no more headhunter and…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MR AND MRS HOWELL  (CONTINUED) (O.S.) …we're out of danger.

PROFESSOR I hope this medicine works.   PULL BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan is seated near another small table in the professor hut.  GILLIGAN What if it doesn't?  PROFESSOR Well we'll have to find another cure. You can't go through life like that.  GILLIGAN Yeah, imagine going through life not knowing which end is up.  PROFESSOR Gilligan I will withhold comment.  GILLIGAN How long will it take for that medicine to work?  PROFESSOR Its effect should be immediate. Listen, hand me that shell over there to my left will you please?  Gilligan tries to walk over to the table and picks up a bowl of berries. He is very unsteady and ends up tipping the bowl over, spilling the contents.  PROFESSOR Oh Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Sorry professor, but, I didn't want to spill it so I, turned it right side up which was wrong side down since everything I see is right is wrong and every thing wrong I see…  PROFESSOR Gilligan, do me a favor will ya? The next time I ask for help, refuse it!  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  PROFESSOR Thank you. Now go over there and sit down!  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  PAN RIGHT WITH GILLIGAN TO TABLE  Gilligan hits a table, knocking it over. He makes his way to the chair and sits down.  GILLIGAN I made it!  PULL BACK TO WIDE SHOT  PROFESSOR Yes, what you made is a mess.  The skipper enters the hut carrying a bowl of Captibora berries.  SKIPPER Hi Gilligan, hi professor. I found a whole bunch of berries!  PROFESSOR Oh, wonderful skipper. Now, there's one more thing you can do to make this experiment a complete success.  SKIPPER Wha…what's that professor?  PROFESSOR Take Gilligan outside.  SKIPPER All right.  The skipper grabs Gilligan by the arm and helps him to the door.  SKIPPER Come on Doctor Kildare. Steady as you goes.  The skipper finally manages to get Gilligan to the door, and they head outside. The professor goes back to work as we…  FADE TO: EXT - PROFESSOR'S HUT - DAY  MEDIUM SHOT OF HUT  We see the skipper standing on his head up against the hut as Gilligan sits cross-legged near him.  SKIPPER For a little guy, you can sure get in big trouble.  GILLIGAN That's cause I try harder.  SKIPPER Boy, the things I do for you. GILLIGAN I'm sorry skipper. But this is the only way I can talk to you without falling down, or up or sideways.  The professor comes out of the hut carrying a bowl and notices the skipper on his head.  PROFESSOR Skipper, you are standing on your head aren't you?  SKIPPER Of course I am professor!  PROFESSOR Oh good. For a minute I thought I was working too hard. Come on Gilligan.  The professor helps Gilligan up from the ground and they walk off screen as the skipper tries to get up from being on his head.  SKIPPER Give him some of that stuff before I kill myself!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  The professor helps Gilligan to the table and he nearly misses the chair.  PROFESSOR No Gilligan!  Gilligan finally gets seated.  PROFESSOR That's it. Now close your eyes. Now take just one sip.  Gilligan gets the bowl close to his mouth and smells the concoction.  GILLIGAN Ich!  SKIPPER Drink it will ya!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Smells awful.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Oh the smell is nothing compared to the taste!

The head native signals the others and they all take off in different directions as we…  CUT TO: INT - PROFESSOR'S HUT - DAY  CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  PROFESSOR (O.S.) All right Gilligan close your eyes.  PULL BACK/PAN RIGHT TO WIDE SHOT - GROUP  SKIPPER Why's he keep seeing double now!?  PROFESSOR Well it's probably the Captibora berries. They seem to have unstable properties.  SKIPPER Oh we've GOT to find a some kind of a cure for my little buddy!  GILLIGAN Thanks thanks skipper skipper.  SKIPPER Thanks thanks skipper skipper?  GILLIGAN I didn't want to miss either one of you.  PROFESSOR Gilligan, open your eyes.  The professor looks closely into Gilligan's eyes.  PROFESSOR Oh the pupils are extremely dilated.  SKIPPER That's bad huh?  PROFESSOR Well not necessarily. This entire problem is probably a temporary reaction to the Captibora extract. Frankly, I'm not overly concerned.  GILLIGAN I'm not either, if it was happening to somebody else.  PROFESSOR I'll have to prepare a new extract. Something to counter act the last one.  Mr. and Mrs. Howell walk into the professor's hut.  MR HOWELL A…a Ginger said that you wanted to see us.  PROFESSOR Yes I did. It concerns our young friend here.

We should carry on!  Mr. and Mrs. Howell leave the hut while the skipper and professor are about to.  SKIPPER Stay right here now little buddy, and we'll be back in no time!  PROFESSOR Oh and by the way Gilligan. There may be other side effects caused by the sun's rays and the dilation of your pupils.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR The refraction could cause hallucinations.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN That's ok as long as I don't start seeing things.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - SKIPPER, PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Gilligan, that's what the professor means by hallucination!  PROFESSOR To put it more simply, don't believe everything you see.

GILLIGAN What if I see Bridget Bardo in a towel?  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - SKIPPER, PROFESSOR AND GILLIGAN  SKIPPER Call me!  The professor and the skipper leave the hut on their search for Captibora berries. Gilligan is left alone once again.

He grabs a banana and peels it. He tries to eat it, but keeps missing his mouth.  PULL BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT  We see Gilligan with his banana, as a natives approach from behind. Just as he swings his machete, Gilligan drops the banana making him bend over. Once again the native slices empty air.

GILLIGAN Don't worry Mrs. Howell, I'll stay mixed up as ever.  MRS HOWELL Oh that's thoughtful of you dear.  MR HOWELL Well well it's siesta time.  MRS HOWELL Yes, berry picking is very tiring.

GILLIGAN Yeah, there was two Mary Ann's, two Ginger's…  SKIPPER Oh never mind!  PROFESSOR Now Gilligan, I want you to take just one sip. Close your eyes. And don't open them again until I tell you.  GILLIGAN Ok.  Gilligan closes his eyes, and takes a drink from the bowl.  PROFESSOR Now when you open your eyes, your vision should be cleared.   PROFESSOR All right Gilligan, open your eyes.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  He opens his eyes and reacts.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR (FIVE IMAGES)  GILLIGAN (O.S.) I see five professors and five skippers.  PROFESSOR Five images!? Of everything!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  He's shaking his head yes.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR Oh no! The extract must have reacted in some sort of weird geometric progression!  SKIPPER Oh professor I'm afraid you're not helping my little buddy at all.  PROFESSOR I'm afraid not skipper. Gilligan, forgive me.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I will professor as soon as you get rid of all those people.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER (FIVE IMAGES)  PROFESSOR However it should be possible to reverse the process.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) We must dilute the extract.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR Here Gilligan, close your eyes and drink this water.  The professor hands Gilligan a gourd with water. Gilligan closes his eyes and takes a drink. The professor keeps a close watch on the time with his stopwatch.  PROFESSOR Now keep drinking.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  He continues to drink water.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Keep drinking.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR All right open your eyes.  CUT OT: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan opens his eyes and is visibly happy.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR (TRANSITION FROM BLURRED TO CLEAR IMAGE)  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  SKIPPER (O.S.) Well?  GILLIGAN I see one of you each!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  SKIPPER It's wonderful!  PROFESSOR He's cured!  SKIPPER Yes!  GILLIGAN Well not quite, I still see those natives I've been imagining.  The skipper and professor look confused.  PROFESSOR What natives!?  GILLIGAN The ones I've been imagining all day.  SKIPPER What natives have you been imagining all day!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Like the ones that are about to grab the professor.  A native grabs the professor and has his machete at his throat as he drags him away.  PROFESSOR Gilligan you haven't been imagining! He's real!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Real!?  Gilligan gets up from the table and takes off.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - HUT CLEARING  Gilligan leaps across the table as a native gives chase.  PAN LEFT WITH GILLIGAN AND NATIVE  The native chases Gilligan off camera as we…  PAN RIGHT TO PROFESSOR, SKIPPER AND NATIVES.  The skipper and professor are seen being held by the natives with machetes at their throats as we…  FADE TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY  WIDE SHOT THROUGH JUNGLE VEGETATION  We see all the castaways except Gilligan locked in the bamboo cage built by the natives.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN AT CLEARINGS EDGE  Gilligan parts the vegetation and is observing the natives from the safety of the bushes near the clearings edge.  GILLIGAN One, two, three. And one of me. That's three against one. If I could only get them out numbered.  Gilligan looks like he has an idea.  GILLIGAN Out numbered!? Yeah!  Gilligan retreats into the jungle as we…  FADE TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan comes running on camera and heads for the table with the bowl of Captibora berry juice. He picks up the bowl and gives it a sniff.  GILLIGAN Ugh!  He takes the bowl and heads back into the jungle as we…  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY  WIDE SHOT OF CLEARING - HIGH POINT OF VIEW  HEAD NATIVE Wala Nana. Winona!  The native makes a throat slashing gesture and growling sound that amuses the others who start to laugh.  NATIVE NO.2 I'deae Inona!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP - INSIDE CAGE  SKIPPER What'd they say?  PROFESSOR Before they kill us, they plan on taking us to their island for a formal ceremony.  MRS HOWELL Oh, did you say formal ceremony?  PROFESSOR Yes.  MRS HOWELL Oh well then professor you must have exaggerated their brutality. Nobody who gives a formal can be all bad.  GINGER Professor you speak their language, can't you talk to them!?  PROFESSOR Well Ginger it's not a matter of talking to them. It's their tribal custom to kill all strangers.  MR HOWELL Well let's try being friendly!  Everyone agrees and gets close to the cages walls. They all start to smile and wave happily.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP - THROUGH CAGE BARS  MRS HOWELL Yoo hoo!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF NATIVES  They look over off screen at the castaways.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP - THROUGH CAGE BARS  The castaways are still trying to be friendly.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF NATIVES  They're not interested in being friendly and go about talking to themselves.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP - THROUGH CAGE BARS  PROFESSOR It would appear they don't make friends.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP - INSIDE CAGE  MARY ANN Well I'm not giving up hope!  GINGER Thank you Mary Poppins!  MARY ANN Oh but Gilligan's still free! He can rescue us!  SKIPPER Gilligan, rescue us!?  MR HOWELL He couldn't pick the winner of a one horse race!  SKIPPER I wouldn't put it passed him to walk right up and get himself captured!  The skipper looks off screen and reacts.  SKIPPER Oh no!  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE - JUNGLE CLEARING - MEDIUM SHOT  We see Gilligan emerge from the jungle carrying the bowl of juice.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF NATIVES  The natives look over and see Gilligan and react.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is standing, pretending to drink from the bowl and making agreeable sounds.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF NATIVES  They start to run in Gilligan's direction and off camera.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is still drinking from the bowl and making all sorts of agreeable sounds and rubbing his stomach like it's good.  GILLIGAN Mmmmm! Mmmmm! Real nummy num num!  The natives walk on camera and surround Gilligan to see what he's doing. Gilligan keeps up his "oh it's so good" impression.  GILLIGAN Mmmmm! Mmmmm!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  They're standing, open mouthed watching Gilligan.  SKIPPER There, what'd I tell ya!? Our hero!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The natives are curious about what Gilligan has and Gilligan hands the bowl to them. They take the bowl from Gilligan and start to inspect it as Gilligan walks away.  PAN LEFT WITH GILLIGAN TO CAGE  MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP IN CAGE  GILLIGAN Hi everybody!  MARY ANN Gilligan, why did you give yourself up!?  GILLIGAN I got an idea!  Skipper Oh brother.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN I have ideas.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER I know!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Well I thought if that berry juice makes you see double, makes you see three time and four times, and if they drink it…  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Yes! Then they'd see four times as many of us!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN And they'll think they're out numbered!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  PROFESSOR It's an excellent plan!  SKIPPER Oh it is an excellent plan. I just wish that somebody else had thought of it.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan looks disappointed.  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Well what difference does it make who thought of it!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF MARY ANN, SKIPPER, GINGER AND PROFESSOR  SKIPPER Well because Gilligan is the only one I know that can, snatch defeat right out of the mouth of victory!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  He still looks depressed.  MR HOWELL (O.S.) Look!  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF NATIVES  The natives are each taking turns drinking the juice from the bowl. They seem to actually like the taste.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP  GILLIGAN Now if it takes as long on them as it took on me…  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The natives look up and see the castaways in the cage.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  GILLIGAN Yeah, right about now.  Gilligan unlocks the cage.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF NATIVES  They all react at the sight.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP IN CAGE (FIVE IMAGES)  We see the castaways as they file out of the cage.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF NATIVES  They are looking at each other and acting confused.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP IN CAGE (FIVE IMAGES)  The castaways are now all yelling and screaming as they wave their arms about.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF NATIVES  They're still trying to sort out what they see.  CUT TO: WIDE SHOT - GROUP IN CAGE (FIVE IMAGES)  We see Gilligan, Mary Ann and Mr. And Mrs. Howell still yelling and waving their arms.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF NATIVES  The natives are frightened by what they see and react. They drop the bowl and scream. They run off camera into the jungle as we…  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  They are still yelling and screaming at the natives.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY (SLOW SPEED FILMING)  The natives are seen running on camera in a comedic fashion. They fall over each other and then leap into the lagoon.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP  The others are congratulating Gilligan on his rescue.  MR HOWELL Oh Gilligan!  SKIPPER You did it! You did it little buddy!  They continue to yell their appreciation in an ad-lib fashion as we…    FADE OUT:        EPILOG  FADE IN:  STOCK SHOT OF PALM TREE AND BLUE SKY  CUT TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  WIDE SHOT  We see Gilligan and the skipper sitting at the communal table.  GILLIGAN …And Mr. Howell gave me a neat hundred-dollar bill, and professor gave me a neat magnifying glass, and Ginger gave me a neat kiss.  How come she never gives me something good like a slingshot?  SLOW ZOOM IN FOR MEDIUM SHOT  SKIPPER But Gilligan, they were giving you tokens of appreciation for saving their lives!  GILLIGAN Oh they didn't have to do that! They'd do the same thing for me!  Mary Ann walks on camera from behind Gilligan.  MARY ANN Gilligan, I backed you a banana cream pie!  She sets it down in front of Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Oh it's beautiful. I can hardly wait to eat it!  Gilligan picks up the bowl of Captibora juice and takes a drink.  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan! Don't drink that! Gilligan! You just drank that Captibora extract!  GILLIGAN I know it!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is wide eyed as he looks off camera at the table.  SKIPPER (O.S.) Well!?  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF PIE ON TABLE (FIVE IMAGES)  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Now I've got FIVE pies!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN  Gilligan is licking his lips with anticipation.  CUT TO: MEDIUM SHOT OF SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN  Gilligan is trying to grab one of the five pies, but keeps missing. He finally hits the table in frustration and the pie catapults into the skippers face. Gilligan looks at the skipper and wipes a piece of whip cream from his face and takes a taste. The Skipper is left with pie on his face as well.   FADE OUT:   END CREDITS 
Episode #95, "It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Gilligan" (A United States jetpack washes ashore in the lagoon) GILLIGAN担 ISLAND   "It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Gilligan"  by  Sam Locke  and  Joel Rapp   January 24, 1967    TEASER  FADE IN:  INT - AIR FORCE BUILDING - DAY  INSERT - MOVIE SCREEN SHOWING A MAN WEARING A JETPACK AND TAKING OFF.  HE IS FLYING AND DROPPING SIMULATED EXPLOSIVES. THERE ARE TWO AIR FORCE OFFICERS WATCHING THE MOVIE.  COLONEL Now watch this next maneuver General.  INSERT - PILOT DEMONSTRATES VARIES MANEUVERS WEARING THE JETPACK SUCH AS FLYING OVER BUILDINGS AND SHIPS AND FLYING ACROSSED OPEN WATER. THE MOVIE ENDS.  COLONEL Well Sir?  GENERAL Ah, seems like quite a devise Colonel. You're ah convinced that I should authorize this for official Air Force use?  COLONEL General, our tests in the Pacific indicate that the XJP will render all other manually controlled jetpacks obsolete.  It's compact and lightweight.  Practically anybody can operate it and it has a range of over five hundred miles.  Frankly sir I think it's a perfect machine.  There's a knock on the door.  COLONEL Come in!  A lieutenant enters the room and salutes. He is carrying a letter for the Colonel.  LIEUTENANT Begging the Colonels pardon sir.  COLONEL Yes Lieutenant?  LIEUTENANT Just received this message from the test ship in the pacific sir.  He hands the message to the Colonel who then reads it silently.  GENERAL Bad news Colonel?  COLONEL It seems out perfect machine has become a victim of human error sir.  The General takes the message and reads out loud.  GENERAL JETPACK XJP LOST AT SEA. PLEASE ADVISE.  Yah that is bad news.  COLONEL Yes sir.  We certainly wouldn't want the XJP to fall into the wrong hands.  Lieutenant, authorize the fleet to begin a search for the pack at once!  LIEUTENANT Yes sir.  The lieutenant salutes and walks out.  COLONEL I wouldn't be too concerned General.  The pack should stay afloat for several days and...Well I believe our ships will find it.  GENERAL Good.  You know what I can't believe is that man has reached the age where he can fly like a bird.  You know...I haven't seen one of these since I was a boy reading the adventures of Buck Rogers!  FLIP TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY  Gilligan and skipper are seen examining the jetpack that washed ashore.  SKIPPER Buck who?!  GILLIGAN Buck Rogers.  He was the guy who use to fly around in one of these things.  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan why don't you stop...  The professor walks up behind Gilligan and the skipper. He doesn't see the jetpack at first.  PROFESSOR Hi any luck? What's that!?  GILLIGAN I think its Buck Rogers rocket.  PROFESSOR Let me see that!  GILLIGAN If it's Buck Rogers's rocket his mother would have sewn his name on it somewhere.  SKIPPER Gilligan!  There is no such person as Buck Rogers!  He was a comic book character!  GILLIGAN Did you ever meet Buck Rogers?  SKIPPER Of course not!  GILLIGAN Then how do you know he wasn't a real person!?  SKIPPER I'm gonna explain it once more and then I'm...  PROFESSOR Gilligan you're right!  GILLIGAN I am?  SKIPPER You mean...this does belong to Buck Rogers?  PROFESSOR No! But this is a jet powered flight pack and it's practically full of fuel!  SKIPPER Well maybe we can find some way to use it to get off the Island!  PROFESSOR I'll begin experiments right away!  You know...it's just possible that there's enough fuel in this jetpack to get it all the way back to Hawaii!  SKIPPER Oh boy!  Let's start experimenting! Come on Gilligan!  Gilligan, the skipper and the professor take the jetpack and run off down a path next to the lagoon.  FADE OUT:      ACT ONE  FADE IN: EXT - HUT - DAY STOCK SHOT OF HUT EXTERIOR WITH CREDITS OVERLAYED  CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY  The professor is seen in his hut with tables loaded with test tubes and various other equipment made from gourds, bamboo and vines.  The professor is just about to mix two samples in test tubes when the Skipper and Gilligan come running into the hut.  GILLIGAN Hey professor! Professor!  The professor, being startled, spills the two test tubes.  PROFESSOR Oh good heavens, look what you made me do!  SKIPPER Sorry professor, but we're dying to find out if this jetpack is going to be able to fly to Hawaii!  PROFESSOR Well there's a chance skipper, but...  SKIPPER Did you hear that Gilligan!?  One of us might be able to fly to Hawaii!  Isn't that great news!?  GILLIGAN Yeah it's a long trip there.  I hope the jetpack has a good movie!  SKIPPER Yes, so do I because...  The skipper gives Gilligan a dirty look.  PROFESSOR When you gentlemen leave I can complete this fuel analysis.  SKIPPER All right professor we're going right now, come on Gilligan.  As the skipper and Gilligan start leaving the hut, Gilligan turns around and starts to ask another question.  GILLIGAN Professor I have just one more question...  The skipper, seeing what Gilligan is doing, grabs him and hauls him out of the hut.  The skipper and Gilligan leave the hut as the professor returns to his table and begins his experiments again. As before, as he begins to mix the two test tubes together, Mary Ann and Ginger come running into the hut.  MARY ANN Oh professor!  GINGER Professor!  Once again, being startled, the professor spills the test tubes.  PROFESSOR Why did you girls have to burst in to the middle of an experiment?!  GINGER Ah we're sorry professor but we heard that Gilligan found some kind of a jetpack to get us off the island!  PROFESSOR Well it's possible Ginger, but I won't know until I complete these tests.  GINGER OH you just don't know how disparately I want to breathe the heady wines of civilization again.  OH to meet a tall handsome man and have a candle lit dinner for two and then after dinner to dance...OH just to float...just float through the air until dawns gentle fingers pull back the soft blanket of night.  That's a scene from a tender romantic movie I was in.  It was called "The bird people meet the chicken pluckers".   PROFESSOR All right will you girls LEAVE now so I can continue my work!  GINGER & MARY ANN But professor!  PROFESSOR All right OUT!  SHOO!  I'll let you know the results the moment I'm finished! Now GO!  The professor escorts the girls to the door and sees them out.  He checks outside once again to see if there is anyone else lurking outside. Again, the professor returns to his work, confident there will be no further interruptions.  As he begins to pour the two test tubes together just as Mr. and Mrs. Howell run into the hut. Mr. Howell grabs the professor's arm to get his attention.  MR HOWELL Professor!  Once again the professor spills the contents of the test tubes.  MR HOWELL Oh I'm terribly sorry!  MRS HOWELL Oh dear professor did we cause you to spill that?!  PROFESSOR Oh not at all Mrs. Howell. I've had so much practice recently I could have spilled it without you help.  MR HOWELL How soon will you know if the flight is feasible?  PROFESSOR Well if you'll both be quiet, I will know in a minute.  The professor pours the two test tubes together and one of them foams up and over the top with a blue foam.  MRS HOWELL Well professor?  Can one of us fly off for help now?   PROFESSOR I'm afraid not Mrs. Howell.  Although my experiments indicate the jetpack has sufficient flight range to reach Hawaii, I'm afraid such a flight would be terribly terribly risky.  MR HOWELL Nothing is too risky to save a Howell.  MRS HOWELL Two Howells dear.  MR HOWELL That's right, make that two Howells.  PROFESSOR Besides risk, we're facing a time problem. You see the fuel in this jetpack has given me a propellant potency retention problem.  MR HOWELL How dare you talk that way in front of my wife!  PROFESSOR A what I meant was, that this particular type of fuel loses its potency when it gets old.  MR HOWELL Nonsense professor!  Haven't you heard...there's no fuel like an old fuel! HA that was a witty one!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Mr. and Mrs. Howell are seen crouched down behind some jungle plants watching the professor leave the hut where he's been doing the experiments.  MR HOWELL (SOTTO) Let's sneak in and get the jetpack.  MRS HOWELL Oh it seems such a mean trick to play on Gilligan.  MR HOWELL (SOTTO) Well I know how you feel dear, but...but you heard the professor.  If one of us doesn't attempt this trip soon, our chance at being rescued will be ruined.  MRS HOWELL True.  MR HOWELL (SOTTO) Gilligan is the only one on the island that can make this trip.  He's young, he's wiry and he's agile.  Besides who else could we possibly trick into doing it!?  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY  Mr. Howell is seen wearing the jetpack as Mrs. Howell is seen with Gilligan as she attempts to stop Mr. Howell from taking the flight.  MRS HOWELL You see Gilligan he's determined to go through with this!  MR HOWELL Lovey! How dare you bring Gilligan here! He's sure to try and stop me from...from making this flight.  GILLIGAN Now wait a minute Mr. Howell.  MR HOWELL I don't know how to forgive you Lovey for what you've done!  GILLIGAN Don't be angry Mr. Howell.  She doesn't want you to make the flight either.  MR HOWELL Well if I won't make the flight who will?  GILLIGAN Well...  MR HOWELL Ah HA!  I should have known that you would want to grab the glory!  GILLIGAN Oh...  MR HOWELL Oh you can't fool me Gilligan!  You know who ever makes this flight will be a national hero!  And you're aching to go instead of me!  GILLIGAN Is that what you think!?  MR HOWELL I don't THINK sir, I KNOW!  GILLIGAN I know you don't know either!  MR HOWELL Now wait a minute, wait a minute don't try and stop me!  Cause it won't do any good.  GILLIGAN Ok I won't try and stop you.  MR HOWELL Well I know your persistence is hard to breakdown my boy, but before you convince me that you should go instead of me.  Give me one good reason, one sir, why I shouldn't make this flight!  MRS HOWELL Thurston, if anything happened to you, who would take care of me and all our beloved little Howells?  GILLIGAN What beloved little Howells?  MRS HOWELL Well the Howell steel company and the Howel chemical company and the Howell...  MR HOWELL That's just it Lovey!  I'm tired of being a man who's known for the companies he keeps!  I want to be known as a man who would risk his life for his dear and beloved friends!  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston!  MR HOWELL Please try to understand Gilligan.  Despite my advanced age, and my physical inability, and the fact that you're more qualified, I am going to make this flight!  So please leave me to do...what I must do!  GILLIGAN That's very brave and noble Mr. Howell.  But I think I ought to be the one that takes the flight.  MRS HOWELL There you just go!  You heard what Mr. Howell said.    Go ahead!  I want to be alone to say goodbye to my husband.  Gilligan walks off as Mrs. Howell is saying her last goodbye.  MR HOWELL Lovey how could you!?  MRS HOWELL Oh darling how could I what, you brave courageous thing?  MR HOWELL Well how could you make Gilligan go away?  MRS HOWELL But you SAID you wanted him to leave!  MR HOWELL No it was just an act, to trick him into making the flight!  MRS HOWELL Oh darling I forgot what a marvelous actor you were!  Oh and all this is just a little play.  Are you furious with me?  MR HOWELL Of course not...it's showbiz!     DISSOLVE TO: EXT - JUNGEL CLEARING - DAY  Mary Ann and Ginger are in the clearing with Ginger wearing the jetpack.  GINGER Hurry up Mary Ann, I think I hear Gilligan! Hurry up!  MARY ANN Ok...  Oh Gilligan!  Gilligan! Oh come quick!  GILLIGAN What is it Mary Ann?  MARY ANN Oh Gilligan, Ginger is going to fly to Hawaii, you've got to stop her!  GILLIGAN You better find somebody else. I already tried to stop Mr. Howell and couldn't do it.  GINGER Nobody is going to stop me Mary Ann.  If I have to sacrifice myself for my friends I intend to do so.  GILLIGAN You don't want to sacrifice yourself!  GINGER Of course I do!  Is there a brave decent person on this island that wouldn't want to?  GILLIGAN No, but there's a rotten cowardly person that doesn't want to.  MARY ANN Gilligan!  GILLIGAN You guessed it!  GINGER Mary Ann...um...would you give me a few minutes alone with Gilligan?  Marry Ann gets the high sign from Ginger and pretends to leave.  GINGER Gilligan?  GILLIGAN Hmmm?  GINGER There's something that I want to do before I fly away.  GILLIGAN Buy insurance?  GINGER No.  I want to give you a goodbye kiss.  GILLIGAN You don't have to!  I'm not going anyplace!  Ginger starts to kiss Gilligan as Mary Ann removes the jetpack from Ginger and places it on Gilligan. Ginger continues to kiss Gilligan as Mary Ann straps the jetpack into place.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The skipper and the professor are seen walking through the jungle near where Ginger and Gilligan are.  SKIPPER ...I see, well, now let me get this plan straight professor.  We build a dummy, we strap the jetpack to it, pin a note to it and then send it off to Hawaii from a launching pad.  PROFESSOR Exactly!  Here's the drawing I made.  The professor hands skipper the paper with the drawing. The skipper examines the plans intently.  SKIPPER Wow what a brilliant idea!  PROFESSOR Well frankly skipper, I think it's my most brilliant idea.  There's only one thing I'm not certain of.   SKIPPER Oh what's that?  PROFESSOR If it'll work!  The skipper and professor look up and notices Ginger kissing Gilligan.  CUT TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is wearing the jetpack as Mary Ann looks on.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The skipper and professor look on as they see Ginger and Gilligan still locked in a kiss.  SKIPPER Wow, I wonder what's going on over there!?  The skipper and the professor take off towards the clearing to see what's going on.  CUT TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  PROFESSOR Good heavens...what's going on here?!  GINGER Ah professor...wa...well...  MARY ANN Well I guess we'd better confess Ginger.  We were desperate, we wanted somebody to try to fly to Hawaii.  PROFESSOR Well you can stop being desperate Mary Ann. Someone IS going to fly to Hawaii!  GINGER They are?!  Who?!  SKIPPER The dummy!  At hearing the word dummy, Gilligan comes too from his encounter with Ginger.   GILLIGAN Huh?  What'd you say?  SKIPPER I said the dummy is going to fly to Hawaii!  Gilligan thinks the skipper means him and over reacts immediately.  GILLIGAN Oh no I'm not!  I'm not flying anyplace! How'd I get in this thing?!  Let me out of here! I'm getting out of here!  Gilligan gets the jetpack off and hands it away.  GILLIGAN Here take this jetpack!  Gilligan runs off screen.  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Ginger and Mary Ann are busy at work on the dummy.  MARY ANN There! How do you think he looks?  GINGER Well...he's not exactly Rock Hudson, but I guess he'll have to do.  Now we have to make sure he's six feet five inches tall.  MARY ANN How we gonna find that out without a tape measurer?  GINGER Easy!  Ginger walks up to the dummy and puts her arms around it's neck and waist as though she's going to kiss it.  MARY ANN Ginger, what are you doing?  GINGER Well I use to go steady with this basketball player, he was exactly six feet five...and I know just how much I had to reach up to kiss him.  Mrs. Howell enters the hut and does not immediately notice Ginger with her arms around the dummies neck and waist.   MRS HOWELL Oh Ginger have you got a...?  GINGER What is it Mrs. Howell?  MRS HOWELL Well I don't mean to meddle dear, but since that dummy is about to fly away, do you think it wise to become emotionally involved?  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan, the skipper and the professor are standing around an angled launch pad with the dummy lying against it.  SKIPPER There's just one thing I don't understand professor?  PROFESSOR Yes?  SKIPPER Well...how's the dummy going to operate the jetpack when he flies to Hawaii?  PROFESSOR You see, by building him to exact height and weight specifications...and by placing him precisely at the proper angle on the pad, I feel the essential thrust of the rocket will be enough to send him on a direct and unswerving azimuth to Hawaii.  SKIPPER Ah...did you hear that Gilligan?  GILLIGAN My right ear heard it, my left ear is waiting for the translation.  PROFESSOR I merely said the dummies all set to go!  GILLIGAN Oh you know skipper, I'm kind of worried about the dummy making the flight.  SKIPPER Oh you don't have to worry about that, the professor's got it all worked out.  Dummy will definitely fly to Hawaii.  GILLIGAN Do you think he's dressed right?  You know it's the rainy season in Honolulu.  SKIPPER Yes I know but I don't think he should...  Oh will you stop with that conversation!  PROFESSOR Now...all I have to do is write this note, put it on the dummy and we'll be all set to blast off.  GILLIGAN Have a good trip dummy!  Don't forget to write!  Gilligan gives the dummy a good luck slap on the back and the dummy falls over face down.  The professor and the skipper are not too pleased.  GILLIGAN I'll pick it up.  Gilligan straddles the dummy in order to pick it up and inadvertently hits the activation button on the end of the control grip. The jetpack activates and Gilligan and the dummy start to jet across the ground through the jungle.  PROFESSOR Gilligan stop him!  I haven't finished the note!  GILLIGAN Skipper!  Skipper!  The skipper and the professor take off after Gilligan who is now screaming along a jungle path on the back of the dummy.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  INSERT: VIEW POINT JUST BEHIND GILLIGAN OF TRIP THROUGH JUNGLE AND OUT INTO THE LAGOON.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY  Gilligan rides the dummy into the lagoon and falls off. The skipper and the professor come to Gilligans aid. illigan crawls out of the lagoon and onto the shore.  GILLIGAN Ah, ah...where's the dummy!?  Oh here it comes.  The dummy and jetpack slowly arrive back on shore and is pick up by the professor, which he then examines.  PROFESSOR Oh I was afraid of that!  The trip through the jungle and the water carrying the extra weight used up practically all the fuel!  SKIPPER WHAT!  You mean we won't be able to fly it to Hawaii?!  PROFESSOR Afraid not.  SKIPPER Will the real dummy PLEASE stand UP!  The skipper gets frustrated and hits Gilligan with his hat.  FADE OUT   ACT TWO FADE IN: INT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan, the skipper and the professor are in the professor's hut with the jetpack.  The professor has been examining the jetpack after Gilligan's little trip.  SKIPPER Well professor?  PROFESSOR Well...my original conclusion was correct. After Gilligan's little cruise around the lagoon, there isn't nearly enough fuel left for a flight to Hawaii.  SKIPPER (to Gilligan) You know what you are!?  You're bumbling, stupid, incompetent and useless...and those are your good points!  GILLIGAN Your right skipper.  Gilligan takes the skipper's hat and hits himself with it.  GILLIGAN I deserve it.  Mr. and Mrs. Howell come running into the hut.  MR HOWELL Professor! Professor!  We...we heard the most marvelous news on...on the radio...the news cast!  MRS HOWELL All Mr. Howell's stocks have gone up!  MR HOWELL A no...that's not the good news.  We heard there'll be a fleet of ships in the area tomorrow to make a final search for the jetpack!  That's the good news.  SKIPPER What do you make of that professor?  PROFESSOR Well it's a long shot skipper, but I've got an idea that might reduce the odds.  GILLIGAN Can I help professor?  PROFESSOR Please Gilligan...  GILLIGAN I want to do something to make up for what I did.  Please professor?  SKIPPER Gilligan, why don't you go take a flying leap!  PROFESSOR That's it exactly skipper!  That's the basis for my whole idea!  A flying leap!  GILLIGAN Huh?  PROFESSOR All right listen.  There's enough fuel left in the jetpack for about a fifteen minute flight.  Now suppose one of us were to put on the pack and go straight up while the ships were in the area.  That would improve our chances of being spotted immeasurably!  SKIPPER Certainly would!  Well that makes great sense!  MRS HOWELL Oh professor!  It's wonderful having someone like you with us!  Your absolutely marvelous!  MR HOWELL If you were a Republican, you'd be perfect.  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Mr. Howell, Gilligan and the skipper are pacing around outside the hut where the professor is working waiting for the results of his tests.  GILLIGAN The professor sure is taking a long time to decide whether his plans gonna work or not.    MR HOWELL Oh it will work Gilligan.  The professor's trying to decide who will get the assignment of strapping on the jetpack and soaring up in the air.  SKIPPER Oh I guess that's it.  MR HOWELL A well...I suggest to save time, we volunteer.  Anyone volunteer to go up one hundred feet?  Ninety feet?  Anyone willing to put on my elevator shoes?  The professor walks out of the hut.  SKIPPER Well professor?  PROFESSOR Well it'll work.  One of us can go up in the morning and the flight should be comparatively safe.  MR HOWELL I knew it!  NOW who will volunteer?  PREOFESSOR Mr. Howell we can't pick our flyer on a volunteer basis!  MR HOWELL Well why not?  GILLIGAN Because no one wants to volunteer!  MR HOWELL Well that's not true I am not afraid,  I would love to go!  SKIPPER Oh come on Mr. Howell!  PROFESSOR Oh I'm sure Mr. Howell is quite sincere.  But since the rise in altitude causes a lose of oxygen to the brain, we're going to have to take a test to determine which of us is least likely to become light headed or dizzy.  MR HOWELL Take me...take me professor!  I'd love to soar into the wild blue yonder I would...  Mr. Howell suddenly gets frightened as he realizes he has a fear of heights and is up on is toes as he was speaking.  MR HOWELL I get so dizzy on my tippy toes!  Mr. Howell grabs the professor for support.  MR HOWELL Oh hold me professor!  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Mary Ann is peddling a bicycle like device used to rotate a large cylinder made from scraps of wood and bamboo.  Ginger is standing by the cylinder as it goes around and is keeping time.  GINGER Time Mary Ann!  Mary Ann stops peddling and gets off the bike.  The cylinder slows to a stop and Ginger opens the door. The skipper, Mr. Howell and the professor step out in slow motion.  They spin and fall in slow motion as it's apparent they are all extremely dizzy and disoriented.  SKIPPER Wow I can hardly walk!  MR HOWELL I haven't felt like this since I was elected president of the wine tasting society.  PROFESSOR Where's Gilligan?  MR HOWELL Yeah.   Just then, Gilligan pops his head out of the door of the cylinder.  It's apparent the rotation has had no effect on him.  GILLIGAN Hi everybody!  Is the ride over already? That's too bad, I was just having fun!  MARY ANN Why Gilligan isn't dizzy or light headed!  SKIPPER That's because he's dizzy and light headed all the time.  He's just use to it.  MR HOWELL Gilligan my boy, you've been selected as our astronaut fairly and squarely.  GILLIGAN I have!? Could we take the test over again, this time I'll cheat a little!  PROFESSOR Oh come on Gilligan you're about to begin your training as an astronaut.  GILLIGAN Oh professor do I have to?  GINGER Well your not afraid are you?  GILLIGAN Me afraid?  Me afraid?  Me afraid!!  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is hung from vines and is seen swinging back and forth.  The skipper is pulling on vines making Gilligan swing.  Mr. and Mrs. Howell are seen laying on lounge chairs, drinking their tropical drinks and enjoying the afternoon.  MR HOWELL Ninety eight...ninety nine...  MRS HOWELL Thurston?  MR HOWELL Ah yes my dear?  MRS HOWELL This astronaut training is rather vigorous isn't it?  MR HOWELL Yes it's hard to relax with Gilligan hanging about.  How's your drink my dear?  MRS HOWELL Very nice thank you.  MR HOWELL Would you care for another one?  MRS HOWELL Oh thank you dear...this time would you give me a little mint?  MR HOWELL Which little mint would you prefer?  The one in Denver or the one in San Francisco? Ha! That's a Howell rich joke!  GILLIGAN What's the count Mr. Howell?  MR HOWELL The count?  MRS HOWELL Oh of course darling we were suppose to count his swings.  MR HOWELL Oh yes yes...onesy, and now big...big twosy!  SKIPPER NEVER MIND! what time is it Mrs. Howell?  MRS HOWELL Oh it's so hard to see without my lorgnette.  It's a...four rubies past a diamond.  SKIPPER Well I think he's had enough!  Let's let him down.  The skipper helps Gilligan get down from swinging.  SKIPPER Are you all right little buddy?  GILLIGAN I think so, but I don't think I was cut out to be a swinger.  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  The professor is standing next to the launch guide as the skipper carries Gilligan over his shoulder.  Gilligan is obviously not in great shape after the hours of training  SKIPPER Here's our astronaut professor.  PROFESSOR What's wrong with him?  SKIPPER Well he's just so exhausted from all the astronaut training that he's sound asleep.  I better wake him up.  Come on Gilligan...wake up.  Wake up!  Are you awake little buddy?  Gilligan appears to wake up and be responsive.  GILLIGAN Sure skipper!  SKIPPER Ah fine.  The skipper lets go of Gilligan who promptly goes back to sleep and fall down on the ground.  PROFESSOR Let's get him into the jetpack and onto the launch pad before he wakes up.  According to the last news flash, the ships won't be in the area for another ten minutes.  SKIPPER All right lets get him up.  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is now seen wearing the jetpack and standing at the launch pad.  SKIPPER Gilligan little buddy?  Gilligan?  Wake up! Rise and shine!  Gilligan wakes up and is still very groggy.  GILLIGAN Hi skipper.  I was dreaming about wearing the jetpack and blasting of into space.  I'm going back to sleep and see how it turns out.  SKIPPER But that's no dream Gilligan, you are going to blast off in a jetpack!  GILLIGAN I am?  SKIPPER Yes!  Gilligan becomes fully awake and realizes he's wearing the jetpack and panics.  GILLIGAN I am!  Oh I'm getting out of here!  Gilligan makes the attempt to leave but is held back by the skipper.  SKIPPER Oh now wait a minute Gilligan, we've got to get you up in the air so those Navy ships can spot you and we can all get off the island.  PROFESSOR Gilligan, I'm sending the radio up with you so you'll know from the news flashes exactly when the ships are in the area and exactly when they've spotted you.  The professor places the radio which has a cord through the handle around Gilligan's neck.   PROFESSOR Good luck!  GILLIGAN Professor do I really have to!?  The professor takes a pocket watch and uses it as a countdown timer.  The skipper is busy preparing gilligan for his flight.  All three are talking at once.  SKIPPER                 GILLIGAN                        PROFESSOR All right, count down Ah professor I                  ten Don't think we                  nine Should leave this Island!                         Eight Would you get his               I mean I really like            seven hand there                      it very very much!              Six Professor.                      It's really a nice Island!                         five Put your hand on                I'm not going up!               Four This.                           I'm not going up!               Three I'm not!                        Two Good luck                       I'm not going up!               One Gilligan!                       I'm not!                        Blast-off  (skipper activate the jetpack)                    I'm going up!  Oh I'm not gonna go up again!  Gilligan blasts off and goes straight up with a cloud of fire and smoke.  INSERT: AN ACTUAL BELL LABRATORIES JETPACK IS SEEN FLY OVER TREES.  THE PILOT IS DRESSED LIKE GILLIGAN WITH A RED SHIRT AND LIGHT BLUE PANTS.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  All the castaways are present and are standing on a slight hill. The professor is looking through a pair of binoculars as the others look skyward.  SKIPPER Well do you see him professor?  PROFESSOR There he is!  And he's just at the right altitude for our ships to spot him.  CUT TO: GILLIGAN IN JETPACK AT ALTITUDE HOVERING.  GILLIGAN It's not so bad up here!  In fact it's kind of fun!  I'm a bird! I'm a plane! I'm super Gilligan!  A seagull flies past Gilligan as he hovers at his assigned altitude.  The seagull "quacks" like a duck.  GILLIGAN It's the only way to fly!  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The castaways are still in same position looking skywards.  MARY ANN Won't it be wonderful when those sailors pick us up Ginger?  GINGER Won't be the first time it's happened to me Mary Ann!  CUT TO: GILLIGAN HOVERING  GILLIGAN Shouldn't be too long now.  Better keep my ears open for the news.  Gilligan reaches down and turns on the radio.  Gilligan is still tired and yawns.  GILLIGAN Keep my eyes open too.  The radio being on, now has a news bulletin of interest.  RADIO "WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM TO BRING YOU A BULLETIN FROM THE PACIFIC, WHERE NAVY SHIPS ARE SEARCHING FOR A LOST EXPERIMENTAL JETPACK.  THIS IS CHICK HERN REPORTING TO YOU FROM THE DECK OF THE DESTROYER REDWOOD AND WE HAVE JUST SIGHTED A UFO IN THIS AREA!"  GILLIGAN A UFO!?  That's an unidentified flying object from another planet!  Uh I wonder where it is I wonder where it is!  RADIO "ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES SOUTH OF HAWAII."  GILLIGAN That's right where I am!  RADIO "NAVY OBSERVERS HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED WHETHER THE UFO IS FRIENDLY OR UNFRIENDLY."  GILLIGAN I'm not waiting to find out.  I'm getting out of here!  Gilligan kicks in the rocket and rises in to a cloud.  RADIO "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE UFO HAS JUST DISSAPEARED INTO A CLOUD BANK."  GILLIGAN Yeah good!  As long as it's in a cloud it'll never see me!  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The castaways are still watching the sky.  MR HOWELL What's the matter with him professor?  MARY ANN What's he doing?  PROFESSOR Well he's steered himself into a cumulous cloud!  SKIPPER Oh no!  If he's in the cloud those ships won't be able to spot him!  PROFESSOR Oh that's not the worst of it!  MRS HOWELL Oh what do you mean professor?  PROFESSOR Now that he's flown into a cumulous cloud, the exhaust from the jet fuel is bound to seed the water vapor and the result of that will be...  It starts to rain heavily  GINGER RAIN!  PROFESSOR That's a reasonably accurate guess Ginger!  They all try to protect themselves as it continues to rain harder as they run back to their huts.  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Everyone is either seated or standing in the hut.  They are all soaking wet and are using blankets to keep warm. Gilligan is back with them and the radio is on the table.  RADIO "AND SO AS A RESULT OF THE UNEXPECTED HEAVY RAIN STORM IN THE AREA, THE NAVY HAS DECIDED TO ABANDON THEIR SEARCH FOR THE LOST JETPACK"  GINGER That's the end of that.  SKIPPER (TO GILLGAN) And all because you dived into a cloud and started the rain!  GILLIGAN Yeah but the radio said there was a UFO in the area and I was scared.   PROFESSOR Gilligan there was no need for you to be frightened.  You were the UFO they spotted.  GILLIGAN Huh?  MARY ANN They saw you flying around up there and reported an unidentified flying object.  GILLIGAN Me? A UFO?  SKIPPER Yeah and you scared yourself right into ruining our chances of getting off the island!  GILLIGAN Well if I'm a UFO I gotta know one thing!  SKIPPER What's that?  GILLIGAN Am I from Mars or Venus?  Where do I come from?  SKIPPER It all depends on how far I have to chase you!  The skipper takes off after Gilligan and chases him around the hut.  Gilligan runs for the door with the skipper hot on his heels.  At the last second, Gilligan dodges to the left and the skipper heads out the door by himself. Gilligan seeing he's now safe, latches the door to keep the skipper out.  The skipper now standing outside in the rain is not too pleased.  He reaches through the doors window and unlatches the door.  The skipper, now in full threatening view of Gilligan, signals Gilligan to join him in the rain which Gilligan does without complaint.  The other castaways find this rather humorous and begin laughing.  FADE OUT   EPILOG FADE IN: INT - HUT - DAY  The Skipper and the professor are seen entering the hut where the professor has been conducting more experiments with the jetpack.  PROFESSOR ...Once I figured out how to synthesize the jet fuel, it was a simple matter to make enough to make two trips to Hawaii.  SKIPPER Oh boy professor!  How soon are we gonna try it!?  PROFESSOR Well I've already filled the fuel tanks on the jetpack and once we build a new dummy we can...  The professor notices the missing jetpack.  SKIPPER What's the matter?  PROFESSOR The jetpack is gone!  Mary Ann comes running into the hut.  MARY ANN Oh professor!  Skipper come quick!  PROFESSOR What's the matter!?  MARY ANN Oh it's Gilligan!  He's put the jetpack on and he's gonna launch himself to Hawaii!  SKIPPER Oh no!  MARY ANN Oh he thinks it's his fault we weren't rescued the last time.  SKIPPER Well let's go!  CUT TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is seen wearing the jetpack getting ready to take off.  The skipper, professor and Mary Ann come running from behind him.  PROFESSOR Gilligan WAIT!  GILLIGAN Don't worry professor I haven't forgotten one thing you told me about the jetpack not one single solitary thing.  Gilligan activates the jetpack which promptly launches itself into the sky.  Gilligan is left standing in the clearing with everyone else looking on.  GILLIGAN Except to buckle it on!  SKIPPER Nice going Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Skipper give me a boost!  Gilligan is going to attempt reaching up to get the already departed jetpack.  SKIPPER Yeah sure Gilligan.  Give you a boost!  I'll give you a boost!  Skipper is about to clobber Gilligan when we...

Episode #21, “Big Man on a Little Stick” A surfer arrives on the island and the castaways try to encourage him to head back to Hawaii and rescue them. However, he is more interested in making moves on Ginger and Mary Ann than returning to civilization.  “Big Man on a Little Stick”  By  Charles Tannen  and  Lou Huston  February 20, 1965  TEASER FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Gilligan sits on a boulder near the lagoon shore and fishes with a rod and reel. Having hooked something, Gilligan alternates between reeling and tugging on the line. Skipper appears in the distance. He skips rocks in the lagoon until he notices Gilligan struggling with the fish. Skipper rushes to assist Gilligan. SKIPPER Don't let him get away, Gilligan! GILLIGAN I won't, Skipper. Skipper stands by Gilligan and feeds him instructions. SKIPPER Give him some slack. Gilligan releases his grip on the rod and it hits Skipper over the head with the rod. SKIPPER (cont'd) Now, play with him, Gilligan. Gilligan alternates between reeling in and playing out. SKIPPER (cont'd) That's it. Play with him. As Gilligan plays with the fish, he nudges Skipper in the face with the rod. FISHING LINE IN WATER as Gilligan plays with the fish. The water bubbles as the unseen fish struggles beneath the surface. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER (cont'd) What a fighter he is. FISHING LINE IN WATER as Gilligan continues to work the line. BACK TO SCENE SKIPPER (cont'd) He must weigh fifty pounds, yeah. Gilligan pulls the fish out of the water. It is a small fish, less than a foot long. SKIPPER (cont'd) I don't believe it. Gilligan holds the fish and gently tugs on the line. GILLIGAN Okay, come on. GILLIGAN'S HANDS holding fish as the fish opens its mouth and reveals a seashell. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Open up your mouth and give me back the seashell. Gilligan removes the seashell from the fish's mouth and gently pats the fish on its snout. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN (cont'd) (to fish) Thank you. Gilligan sets the fishing rod down on the ground. He carries the fish to the lagoon's edge. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Okay, now. Here we go. Gilligan squats at the water's edge and releases the fish into the lagoon. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Back to school, Irving. SKIPPER Irving? Gilligan stands up. GILLIGAN Oh, yeah. He gets real mad if I call him "Irv." SKIPPER Naturally. Gilligan moves back to the boulder, picks up the rod and reel, and sits back down on the boulder. GILLIGAN He and I are good friends. I catch him almost every day. Gilligan stands up and turns toward Skipper. Skipper notices something in the distance. SKIPPER (points) Hey, what's that? Gilligan glances in the direction Skipper indicates. GILLIGAN It's a guy on a surfboard. (pause) A guy on a surfboard?! Skipper's mouth drops. Gilligan spins around to see DUKE WILLIAMS, 31, riding a surf board across the lagoon. The board hits the beach and Duke steps onto the beach. He collapses face-first on the sand. FADE OUT. END OF TEASER ACT ONE FADE IN: EXT. LAGOON BEACH - DAY Duke lies face-down on the sand. Gilligan straddles Duke and pushes on his shoulders in an awkward way, as if he was trying to resuscitate Duke. Skipper kneels near them. SKIPPER Gilligan, what is it you're trying to do? GILLIGAN Artificial respiration. SKIPPER But he hasn't swallowed any water yet. Maybe a little sand the way you've got him. May I? Gilligan nods and gets out of the way so Skipper can work. Skipper rolls Duke onto his back. SKIPPER (cont'd) All right, boy. Roll over, you're all right. Skipper hits Duke's cheek to stir him. SKIPPER (cont'd) Come on, son, you're all right. Duke stirs, raises his head, and spits. SKIPPER (cont'd) You're okay. Don't try and talk now. Duke gulps in air. Skipper urges Duke to lie back down. SKIPPER (cont'd) Just lie there and rest. GILLIGAN Hey Professor, look what we found! Professor runs up to them and kneels next to Duke. PROFESSOR Yeah, I was in a tree getting some dates, when I saw him come ashore. (to Gilligan and Skipper) Who is he? (to Duke) Who are you? Duke sits up with the assistance of the men. DUKE Duke Williams. PROFESSOR Where are you from? DUKE Topeka, Kansas. GILLIGAN Wow! He sure had along ride. PROFESSOR No, I mean where did you start from? DUKE Oh, oh. I caught a thirty foot one off Waimea Beach. SKIPPER Waimea Beach? But that's near Honolulu. PROFESSOR Duke, it is scientifically absurd to believe you could've ridden the same wave all the way from Hawaii. The counteraction of the marine gravitational forces would have -- DUKE Slow down, Teach. I was a dropout from the second grade. PROFESSOR All right, I'll slow down. DUKE Don't go nowhere, man. Just stay where you are and listen to big daddy. Now there was a large surf making up, and me and a couple of other hotdoggers, were practicing rail grabs and kick outs. Like one joe is a gremmie, so he wipes out at the start. Me, I'm in a nose ride, having a little trouble, when all of a sudden, I'm out of the tube and up on top, only I'm headed for open sea. I mean, I'm riding clear into the middle of the big, salty splash. You got the picture? GILLIGAN Must have been a foreign film. PROFESSOR Now, let's start from the beginning. How long have you been on that board? DUKE Like, you got a fix on what day this is? PROFESSOR Thursday. DUKE I remember swinging with this gidget Saturday night, and then giving her a fast goodbye, so me and the guys could hit the beach Sunday morning. GILLIGAN That was five days ago! Duke counts the days on his fingers. DUKE Say, you're right. SKIPPER Oh, Professor, he couldn't have been out more than two or three hours. Well, his friends are probably out cruising around looking for him right now. PROFESSOR Unless he rode in on a tsunami. GILLIGAN Oh, no, he came in on a board. The Skipper and I saw him. PROFESSOR A tsunami is a giant wave caused by an underground earthquake originating in a seismological fault off the coast of Japan. DUKE Say, is anybody gonna tell me where I am? SKIPPER Duke, I'm afraid you're marooned on an uncharted island. Duke stands up and the others follow suit. DUKE Not for long, pops. Give me a couple days to feed the muscle machine and I'm back to Waimea. GILLIGAN Oh, great! We'll fatten you up and put you on the next salami back to Hawaii. Duke puts his arm around Gilligan. DUKE Little man, lead me to the chow line. Duke and Gilligan walk away. GILLIGAN And when you get there, don't forget to tell them we're marooned here. DUKE (reluctantly) All right. Duke and Gilligan exit. SKIPPER Professor, a reverse tsunami, is that possible? PROFESSOR Not a chance, Skipper. SKIPPER That figures. Why else would Gilligan have thought of it? DISSOLVE TO: INT. BOYS HUT - NIGHT Duke eats a banana as he listens to Skipper tell the tale of the fateful trip. They sit at a table in the boys hut. SKIPPER So, that's the way we ended up on this island. DUKE Man, how do you stand it? SKIPPER Well, it's a little rough for the first couple of months, but you'll get used to it. DUKE Get used to it? I'll go ape. Duke stands. DUKE (cont'd) I just got to get back to Hawaii. SKIPPER Duke, let me tell you something. There is no way off this island. Duke inspects his arms and flexes his muscles. DUKE Admiral, there are no strings on a man with a surfboard. All I got to do is get back in shape. Man, five days on that board and I'm nothing but skin and bones. GINGER looks in one of the windows. GINGER And what skin. BACK TO SCENE Duke notices and turns to look at Ginger. MARY ANN admires Duke from the other window. Mary Ann looks over Duke. MARY ANN And what bones. BACK TO SCENE Duke turns toward Mary Ann. Skipper stands. SKIPPER Ladies, come on in. DUKE Man, you guys ain't lost. You're hiding. Ginger and Mary Ann enter the hut. SKIPPER Duke Williams, this is Ginger Grant and Mary Ann Summers. Duke shakes Ginger's hand. GINGER (sultry) Hello. DUKE (confidently) Howdy. MARY ANN (admiringly) The pleasure's mine. SKIPPER Gilligan was out fishing, and this is what we landed. GINGER Wow! What did you use for bait? Duke flexes his right arm. DUKE You can stop dreaming. The Duke has arrived. Ginger and Mary Ann exchange glances. Duke moves behind Mary Ann and Ginger and puts his arms around the girls. DUKE (cont'd) Oh, I like them little and I like them big. Man, this is "smorgasbroad" time! Duke hugs the girls and they beam. Skipper gives an aside glance and turns away. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUTS - DAY Gilligan discusses Duke William's arrival with the Howells. Mr. Howell sits on a chaise lounge. Mrs. Howell hands Mr. Howell a tall bamboo drinking glass with a straw sticking out of it. MRS HOWELL Did you say duke? Mrs. Howell sits down next to Mr. Howell on the chair. GILLIGAN Yeah, Duke. Mr. Howell sips at the straw. MRS HOWELL Oh, Darling, royalty. MR HOWELL At last, our kind of people. GILLIGAN Maybe I better start over. You see, this Duke Williams was surfing in Hawaii -- MRS HOWELL Thurston, where did we meet the Duke of Williams? MR HOWELL Skeet shooting with Prince Philip? Mrs. Howell stands. MRS HOWELL No, that was the Duke of Albania. MR HOWELL At Monaco with Grace? MRS HOWELL That was the Duke of Troy. GILLIGAN Can I say something? MRS HOWELL No, no, Gilligan. No time for idle chatter, not with a Duke on the island. MR HOWELL The Duke's first day, we must have him for cocktails. Mrs. Howell sits next to Mr. Howell. MRS HOWELL Oh, Thurston, always the right thing at the right time. No wonder you're always sitting on the host's right hand. GILLIGAN Isn't that kind of uncomfortable? MR HOWELL Post haste, pronto, my boy! Mustn't keep the Duke in suspense. Let him know the Howells are here. Gilligan walks to the door and exits. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Duke holds court with the girls. He sits against a boulder and poses for them. Ginger and Mary Ann wear bathing suits, sit on the sand, and admire Duke. DUKE ... took second place at Waikiki. MARY ANN Oh, wow. Who took first prize? Duke stands. DUKE The guy who was married to the judge. GINGER Oh, Duke, you're just not appreciated. DUKE Baby, isn't that what I always say? A lady wanted to do a sculpture of me like this once. Duke poses. MARY ANN Oh, wow. That's you, Duke. That's you. GINGER Oh, I was once painted like this. Ginger poses. DUKE Say, pretty good set of deltoids. Duke brushes his fingers on Ginger's arm to indicate where he deltoids are. GINGER (to Mary Ann) He likes my deltoids. Threatened by Ginger's beauty with respect to their mutual interest in Duke, Mary Ann shifts and poses for Duke too. Duke points at Mary Ann's shoulder. DUKE Oh. Pretty good latissimus dorsi. MARY ANN (to Ginger) He likes my latissimus dorsi. GINGER Whatever that is. DUKE You don't know? GINGER No. Duke points to the muscles behind Mary Ann's shoulder. DUKE Why, that's right here. I remember hotdogging off the coast of Malibu one time. Suddenly the surf went out and we were on the beach. Well, this wahine lays eyes on me, but I give her nothing. I mean, I stand like she's nowhere, but she comes on strong. She won't hold off, but I'm cooling it because the surf might come up -- Gilligan emerges from the jungle and runs into to Duke's arms just as Duke is flexing them. Gilligan drops to the ground like a sack of flour. GILLIGAN Did I hurt you? Duke picks Gilligan up. DUKE Little man, you couldn't knock a hole in the wind with a fistful of hammers. Duke flexes his biceps for Gilligan. GINGER Ooh. MARY ANN Ooh. Gilligan tries to flex his biceps, but they are clearly not as impressive as Duke's arms are. GILLIGAN (to his bicep) Well, just don't lay there. Do something. Anything. Gilligan's bicep flexes briefly. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Oh, boy. Gilligan turns his attention to the group. Duke does deep knee bends for the admiration of the girls. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Hey, has anybody seen the Skipper? You remember the Skipper, don't you? He kinda wears a hat. He's got one big muscle right about here. Ginger and Mary Ann continue to admire Duke as he continues his knee bends. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Oh, well, so long. (pause) Bye. (pause) See you later. Gilligan mock sniffs and exits. FLIP TO: EXT. CAMP - DAY Gilligan exercises with dumbbells made from bamboo and coconuts. Empty coconuts. At Gilligan's feet is a barbell made from a bamboo pole and two large rocks. Skipper enters from the jungle behind Gilligan. As Gilligan exercises, he accidentally hits Skipper in the stomach with the dumbbells. SKIPPER Gilligan, what are you doing? Skipper takes one of the dumbbells from Gilligan. GILLIGAN Hi, Skipper. SKIPPER That is not the answer. GILLIGAN Oh, I'm trying to look like Duke. I mean, he's at the beach with Ginger and Mary Ann now. And he's doing, you know, these Skipper, (muscle poses) and these, (muscle poses) and the girls are like, "Oh, oh!" Skipper examines the dumbbell. SKIPPER You're not going to get anywhere with empty coconut shells. GILLIGAN I'm just starting with those to work up to the big stuff. Skipper looks at the dumbbell and back at Gilligan. SKIPPER Well, okay, little buddy. Good luck. Let me know how you make out. GILLIGAN Skipper, you won't recognize me when I'm all done. I'll be as big as this, I'll have shoulders as big as this and I'll have a chest as big as that. (indicates Skipper's stomach) Except, it'll be up a little higher. Skipper looks down at his stomach. SKIPPER Thanks a lot, Gilligan. Skipper walks off into the jungle. GILLIGAN Ah, I'm sorry, Skipper. Skipper? Gilligan reaches down and tries to pick up the bamboo barbell by lifting with his legs. FLIP TO: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Mary Ann and Ginger each hold onto one of Duke's arms. He stands between them, ready to show off. DUKE All right, girls, go. They hang on and Duke lifts them both off the ground. The girls raise their legs so Duke is completely supporting them. Ginger playfully kicks her feet. GILLIGAN (O.S.) (strained) Help, somebody! Help, anybody big. Help. The girls hear Gilligan's cries for help and drop their legs. Duke lets them down. DUKE Excuse me, girls. Duke exits into the jungle. GILLIGAN (O.S.) (strained) Help. The girls look in the direction Duke went. EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Gilligan lies on his back with the bamboo barbell across his neck and upper shoulders. His arms are unable to move the barbell. Gilligan's legs squirm as he tries to free himself. Duke appears from the jungle and quickly assesses the situation. GILLIGAN (strained) Help. Help. Duke stands before Gilligan. DUKE Gilligan, that's no way to do a back press. Duke bends over and easily removes the barbell from Gilligan's chest. GILLIGAN Is that what I was trying to do? Gilligan rolls over and rises to his feet. Mary Ann and Ginger emerge from the jungle. DUKE Yes. Now watch me. Duke bends over and places the barbell down on the ground. He steps over the barbell to position himself. DUKE (cont'd) It's very simple. Duke positions himself on the sand and lifts the barbell over himself into position. He presses the barbell. MARY ANN AND GINGER gaze admiringly over Duke. DUKE (O.S.) See? BACK TO SCENE Duke rises to his feet still holding the barbell. MARY ANN Oh. GINGER Oh. DUKE Now you try it. Duke hands the barbell to Gilligan. The barbell drops to the ground with Gilligan's hands still holding it. Gilligan drops to his knees. His hands still hold onto the bar. MARY ANN Gilligan, you'll hurt yourself. Duke picks up the barbell. Gilligan stretches out his fingers. DUKE Lie down. On your back. Gilligan lies down on his back and moves into position. Duke places the barbell just above Gilligan's head. DUKE (cont'd) That's it. DUKE ensures that Gilligan is safe. DUKE (cont'd) You got it? GILLIGAN lies on the ground. GILLIGAN Yeah. Yeah. Gilligan strains to press the barbell. He sees it begin to rise and smiles excitedly. DUKE encourages Gilligan. MARY ANN AND GINGER watch expectantly. GILLIGAN loses confidence and strength feels the barbell slipping. He loses control of the barbell and it falls across his neck again. DUKE shakes his head. DUKE Man, you just don't listen. MARY ANN shakes her head. MARY ANN You better give up. BACK TO SCENE Duke lifts the barbell from Gilligan's chest. GINGER You've got to have a body to do that. Gilligan holds his throat. GILLIGAN I've got a body, sort of. Duke positions the barbell over Gilligan and hands it to him. DUKE All right. Here, keep practicing. Let's go, girls. Gilligan holds the barbell up with stiff arms. Duke and the girls exit into the jungle. GILLIGAN Oh, you're not gonna leave me, here. GILLIGAN struggles with the barbell. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Oh, he is gonna leave me. Ooh.

Mr. Howell enters through the beaded door. He carries a small tray of drinks in coconut drinking glasses. Duke holds a half-eaten banana. Mr. Howell passes coconut drinking cups to Duke and then to Mrs. Howell. MR HOWELL Ah, your Highness. I don't think we've ever met before, though we do mingle with royalty, especially during the grouse-hunting season. There you are, Lovey, my dear. DUKE (aside) These nuts come in mixed pairs. Mr. Howell laughs. MR HOWELL Such a droll sense of humor. MRS HOWELL Yes, Thurston, that's what I thought at first, but have we ever known a Duke that looked like that? Duke looks down at his clothes. MR HOWELL I can't say so much for his clothes. Probably a new Italian style. Pizza sharkskin. DUKE I've met some oddballs in my time, but like, you two they let out a little early. Don't go away. I'll get the keeper. Duke puts a half-eaten banana back in the fruit bowl. Duke slowly walks toward the door while keeping an eye on the Howells. MRS HOWELL (to Mr. Howell) I don't remember any duke acting that badly. MR HOWELL (to Mrs. Howell) Not since the one that started World War One. Mr. Howells turns toward Duke. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Sir, I think you are an impostor. DUKE (indignantly) I am not. I am a surfer. MR HOWELL You're not a Duke. You're not even a Count or an Earl. I don't even think you're a Republican! DUKE Charlie, I'm going. You're gone. Duke opens the door and exits.

GILLIGAN I've been exercising. PROFESSOR Why? GILLIGAN So I can die healthy. PROFESSOR Well, stay right here. I've got news that'll brighten up your whole life. GILLIGAN Can I lie down and listen? PROFESSOR Why, of course. Gilligan lies down on one of the benches at the table. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Now, Duke, listen to this. I've been working on this all day. There's been a shift in the trade winds, and the tidal forces compounded by the current pull of the sun have caused a syzygy with the Earth and made a perfect Coriolis effect. Duke turns toward Ginger. DUKE Now, why didn't I think of that? GINGER Isn't he wonderful? PROFESSOR Oh, it's really very simple. The tsunami wave will return in exactly forty eight hours headed for Hawaii. GILLIGAN Hey, Duke, that means you can get us all rescued. DUKE Yeah, we got to talk about that sometime. Come on, girls, let's take a walk. Duke climbs down from the table. Ginger takes his arm. DUKE (cont'd) Right this way. Duke takes Mary Ann's arm and the three of them exit. Professor moves over to Gilligan and sits him upright. PROFESSOR Come on, Gilligan, snap out of it. Gilligan grumbles in pain. PROFESSOR (cont'd) Now listen. Now listen. We've got forty eight hours to get him into shape. We've got to get sugar into his bloodstream. We've got to strengthen his muscles. He has got to be in perf-- GILLIGAN Professor. PROFESSOR What?

SKIPPER (cont'd) May I ask you a simple question? And I want a simple answer. GILLIGAN Sure, Skipper, that's the only kind I know. SKIPPER Exactly. Now, here's my question: Just what are you trying to do? GILLIGAN I'm trying to learn how to surf, because Duke won't go back to Hawaii and if I know how to surf, we could be rescued. SKIPPER Little buddy, your heart is in the right place, but about your head, I don't know. It takes years to master one of these. Now get off of there before you hurt yourself. GILLIGAN Aye, aye, sir. His feet still tied to the surf board, Gilligan tumbles into the water on top of Skipper and they both are soaked. DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

DUKE Listen, I've heard about you movie chicks playing it cool, but aren't you carrying it a little far? GINGER What do you mean, far? Duke leans his arm against the tree. DUKE I'm talking about life, baby. Now you take one long-legged redhead, mix with tall, handsome muscleman, shake well, and -- Duke leans in for a kiss and tries to cup Ginger's face, but she spins away.

MARY ANN (concerned) What's wrong? GINGER Duke. Mary Ann returns to sewing. MARY ANN (smiles) Oh, nothing wrong with him. GINGER Believe me, Mary Ann, while we've been admiring his muscles we overlooked his fangs. Mary Ann turns and looks quizzically at Ginger. GINGER (cont'd) Yeah, underneath that bronzed skin beats the heart of a wolf. MARY ANN Ginger, maybe you're too glamorous. Take me. I'm more like the girl who lives next door. GINGER Girl next door, across the street, around the corner, it wouldn't make any difference to him. Mary Ann gets and and walks over to the door, but she pauses next to Ginger. MARY ANN Please. He's so tall and handsome and -- GINGER And hungry. Where you going? MARY ANN Why, I think I hear Duke calling. Mary Ann pushes the door open slightly. GINGER And you're going? MARY ANN Why, certainly. Mary Ann exits. GINGER Good luck. Mary Ann shuts the door. Ginger gets up from the chair and moves to a seat at the table.

GINGER (cont'd) Not bad time for a little girl. MARY ANN Oh, King Kong had a better approach. They stand. Mary Ann grabs a chair and drags it toward the door. MARY ANN (cont'd) Come on, Ginger, help me move the chair in front of the door. GINGER And honey, he'll huff and he'll puff and blow our house down. MARY ANN Oh, we have to do something to discourage him. Mary Ann holds onto the bamboo door to make sure it doesn't open. GINGER Discourage him? He'd consider a slap in the face applause. No, we've got to bring this to a higher court. Missus Howell. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - NIGHT Mrs. Howell sits on a chair as Mr. Howell enters. MR HOWELL Hello, Lovey, my dear.

MR HOWELL Well, no matter what it is, they deserve it. Here we are trying to figure out how to get Mister America on the surfboard and they're doing everything but giving him the keys to the sorority house if he'll stay. MRS HOWELL The girls want him to leave, too. MR HOWELL You mean they've become disenchanted with that side of beef? MRS HOWELL Thurston, I don't know how to phrase this, but uh, he's been making advances. MR HOWELL You mean, to both of them at once? Ooh, how vulgar. MRS HOWELL Yes, and how young. MR HOWELL You know something? That Duke Williams reminds me of, uh, Montmoransie Vandergrift. MRS HOWELL Thurston, Montmoransie wasn't as bad as all that. MR HOWELL But he did sit a good horse, but nowadays that's not quite enough. MRS HOWELL Well, anyway, I got rid of him once and for all. MR HOWELL Lovey, my dear, I know that we made a pledge never to delve into our past, but I think we should break it just this once for the good of all. Mr. Howell sits down with Mrs. Howell. He places his hands on her arms. MRS HOWELL (innocently) What past, darling? MR HOWELL Your past, just this once. MRS HOWELL (innocently) I really don't think I know what you're talking about.

He walks over to the other men. MR HOWELL Gentlemen! Winken, Blinken and Nod still stuck, blocked by a simple problem. For shame. SKIPPER And I suppose that you have it all solved. MR HOWELL Naturally. You think that country bumpkin is any match for Thurston Howell the Third? GILLIGAN I'll bet it's sneaky and complicated. PUSH IN to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL Sneaky, naturally.

SKIPPER You know something, I've always found it's only the brunettes you can trust. DUKE Right. Just like I was telling Mary Ann before she turned in for the night. SKIPPER Oh, she's not in her hut.

PROFESSOR Skipper you and Gilligan have got to give up this crazy scheme.  SKIPPER Professor there is nothing crazy about trying to reach civilization in order to bring back help.  PROFESSOR On the type of raft your building it's scientifically impossible, you haven't got a chance.  GILLIGAN We haven't?  PROFESSOR Absolutely not.  Gilligan stops working and is about to toss a large bamboo pole he's carrying after hearing that.  SKIPPER (STERNLY) Gilligan.  Gilligan goes back to work.  PROFESSOR With out the proper materials you can't possible survive the wind the waves the coral reefs, not to mention the sharks.  Gilligan once again is about to toss the bamboo pole after hearing the professor.  SKIPPER (STERNLY) Gilligan.  Gilligan goes back to work.  PROFESSOR The entire adventure is suicidal.  Gilligan stops work completely after hearing that and throws down the bamboo pole and tears down his sign.  SKIPPER Get back here!  The skipper grabs Gilligan by the arm and drags him back.  GILLIGAN Skipper, maybe the professor's right. Maybe he got something there. I mean this is a nice little island, why don't we stick around for a little while.  SKIPPER Start tying!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP MARY ANN AND GINGER NEAR LAGOON  Mary Ann and Ginger are sitting sewing a sail for the raft.  MARY ANN It's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard of Ginger.  Gilligan and the skipper risking everything! Braving those stormy seas and fighting off the attack of savages!  GINGER Reminds me of a trip I once took to Catalina on a movie producers yacht.  Gilligan walks on camera to where Mary Ann and Ginger are.  GILLIGAN Hi girls! How you coming along with the sail?  GINGER Great!  MARY ANN Oh it's almost finished!  Mary Ann holds up the sail for Gilligan to see that it's made from bits and pieces including socks.  GILLIGAN Hey those look like my socks in there!  GINGER They are!  GILLIGAN Oh.  MARY ANN Thanks for the contribution it's just what we needed to finish the sail.  Mary Ann looks at the sail and deems it complete.   MARY ANN Well, that does it!  GILLIGAN OK, I'll take it down to the raft.  GINGER Wait!  GILLIGAN Huh.  GINGER Don't you want to read the sail!?  GILLIGAN Read the sail?  MARY ANN Oh it was Gingers idea! Look what she wrote on the front!  Gilligan is standing behind the sail and is looking down at it from above. The sail has the letters S.O.S. spelled out with socks. Gilligan reads the sail out loud.  GILLIGAN Sos?  MARY ANN S   O   S.  GILLIGAN Oh yeah I read it upside down.  GINGER On the other side we wanted to write please hurry, but we ran out of socks.  FLIP TO: EXT – LAGOON – DAY - LATER  The skipper and Gilligan are still working on the raft. Gilligan is using a brush made from bamboo and palm fronds to apply something to the raft. The skipper, with his back to Gilligan is working on another part of the raft.  SKIPPER Before you put that shellac on, make sure that mast is secure.  GILLIGAN Oh the mast is strong enough to hold the sail.  SKIPPER Gilligan, it might have to hold us if we run into a storm out there! Oh never mind I'll check it myself!  The skipper tugs on the ropes securing the mast and appears pleased.  SKIPPER Not bad! Not bad at all! Gilligan your doing a…  The skipper turns around and see Gilligan eating the shellac.  SKIPPER …good…job. What are you doing with that?  GILLIGAN Oh the professor made the shellac out of coconut sap and sugar. You want some?  SKIPPER NO! Now finish up that job!  Gilligan starts to eat the shellac again.  SKIPPER And stop eating that shellac!  The skipper turns without looking and gets tangled in the ropes securing the mast and trips, yelling as he goes.  GILLIGAN Watch the rope skipper!  The skipper regains his balance and give Gilligan a dirty look.  SKIPPER (SARCASTICALLY) Thanks a lot Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Skipper?  SKIPPER What.  GILLIGAN This'd be great frozen! A shellac-cicle!  SKIPPER Where is the putty the professor made?  GILLIGAN Oh the putty is delicious skipper! He made it out of crushed Mangos and berry seeds Mmmmmmp!  SKIPPER Gilligan, can I make you understand this! We are not going out there for a joy ride! It might get pretty rough out there!  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Skipper!?  The professor walks on camera carrying some native artifacts including a necklace and a ceremonial mask.  SKIPPER What is it professor?  PROFESSOR Skipper look at these I found in one of the caves.  SKIPPER Uh oh! Gilligan do you know what these are?  GILLIGAN No, but if they taste as good as the putty I'll have them for desert.  Gilligan reaches out to touch the necklace and the skipper slaps his hand.  SKIPPER Looks like a native arrow head to me.  PROFESSOR Look at this ceremonial mask. It looks very much like the work of the savage Marubi tribe.  SKIPPER Oh professor we have been all over this island, there are no natives on it! Now what is it your driving at?  PROFESSOR First the Marubi still exist as a tribe. Second they may very well be on one of the nearby islands. Third, you and your raft might land on one of those islands.  GILLIGAN Fourth, maybe we shouldn't go.  SKIPPER Gilligan it is our duty. When this raft is ready, we are going to shove off.  GILLIGAN (RELUCTANTLY) Aye, aye, sir.  The skipper walks off camera, leaving Gilligan and the professor.  GILLIGAN Professor? Those savage Marubies, what do they do?  PROFESSOR They're collectors Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Oh that doesn't sound too bad. What do they collect?  PROFESSOR Heads.  The professor starts to walk off camera as he responds.  Gilligan reacts with surprise.  GILLIGAN (HIGH PITCHED) Heads?  FLIP TO: EXT – LAGOON BEACH – DAY  The skipper is working away as Mr. And Mrs. Howell approach.  MR HOWELL Oh skipper. Ah…here's that list of things I want you to do the moment your raft docks.  SKIPPER I'll get to 'em just as soon as I can Mr. Howell.  MR HOWELL Yes I think you'll find the list self explanatory. These are the names of the stocks you see.  The letter S opposite means sell, B means buy, M means merge and H means…wonder what H means?  MRS HOWELL H is for Howell dear, it's your note paper.  MR HOWELL Ah yes yes of course, H that's me! You too.  SKIPPER You folks don't understand. We'll be kept busy when we land just arranging a rescue party.  MRS HOWELL Oh, captain, speaking of parties, would you please get in touch with Mrs. Vanhampton? You see Mr. Howell and I promised to attend her party, and we weren't able to, what with getting ship wrecked and everything.  SKIPPER Well I'm sorry folks but I can't worry about the stock market and parties. We've got a lot of things to do FIRST!  MR HOWELL Lovey, there's only one way to protect our interests. I will have to go along on the raft. Ah Gilligan, bring my luggage.  GILLIGAN Yes sir.  SKIPPER Never mind Gilligan! Just keep loading the supplies on board.  Gilligan Yes sir.  SKIPPER Mr. Howell, you don't know what it's like out there on the ocean. You may be bitten by a shark!  MR HOWELL A shark bite a Howell!? Heh…heh he wouldn't dare!  SKIPPER Well besides, we haven't got room enough for your luggage!  MR HOWELL Oh well that's different. If I can't go first class, I won't go at all! Come along Lovey. Even tourist is crowded!  SKIPPER Well folks, looks like Gilligan and I are ready to shove off!  MARY ANN AND GINGER Wait a minute!  MARY ANN Wait, these are for you! They'll bring you luck!  Mary Ann and Ginger have brought Hawaiian style lei's and start putting them around the skipper and Gilligan's necks.  SKIPPER Well how very nice ladies! Just wonderful. Just about all I can say is Aloha Nui Oi. That's Hawaiian for, till we meet again.  GINGER I learned a little Hawaiian. When I was singing in a club in Waikiki. Wahni Wiki huki loki nu, and every word of it comes from the bottom of my heart.  GILLIGAN Gee that's real nice Ginger. What does it mean?  GINGER This bar is off limits to all military personnel.  SKIPPER Well come on Gilligan, it looks like we're ready to shove off! Hoist the anchor, let go of the stern line!  The skipper and Gilligan start to paddle the raft away from shore. Since Gilligan failed to hoist the anchor, the raft only goes so far and stops. Meanwhile the skipper and Gilligan are frantically rowing.  ALL (AD LIBBING) Aloha! Good Bye! Bon Voyage!...  SKIPPER Goodbye folks!  Row Gilligan! Row!  ALL (AD LIBBING) Aloha! Good Bye! Bon Voyage!  GILLIGAN Goodbye! Bye! Bye!  The skipper finally realizes why they're not going anywhere.  SKIPPER Gilligan. Gilligan! Did you pull in the anchor!?  GILLIGAN That would make us go a lot faster.  SKIPPER Well go get it!  Gilligan gets off the raft and runs over to the anchor and lifts it up. Gilligan walks with the anchor into the lagoon as the raft sails away. The skipper seems completely unaware that he's not onboard and keeps rowing.  GILLIGAN Well, bye!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - GINGER  GINGER (YELLING) Call my agent!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - PROFESSOR, MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  PROFESSOR (YELLING) Be careful!  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON – RAFT SHOT  SKIPPER Goodbye!  GILLIGAN Bye!  MARY ANN (YELLING) Be careful!  GILLIGAN Bye!  GINGER Goodbye Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Bye!   Gilligan keeps walking with the anchor as he follows the raft.  He continues to walk until he's completely underwater. The remaining castaways on shore are witness to the whole thing but keep yelling out their farewells. Mrs. Howell is becoming concerned.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP - PROFESSOR, MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  MRS HOWELL Thurston, I do believe Gilligan's gone underwater.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The skipper finally realizes Gilligan's underwater.  SKIPPER Gilligan! (pause) Gilligan!  The skipper pulls up on the anchor rope and Gilligan pops to the surface.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP – PROFESSOR, MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  MR HOWELL Good, he's up again.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The skipper is then pulled off the raft by Gilligan and ends up in the lagoon too.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP – MARY ANN AND GINGER  GINGER Take care!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP – PROFESSOR, MR. AND MRS. HOWELL  CUT TO: EXT – LAGOON – RAFT SHOT  Gilligan is helping the skipper back up on the raft.  FADE TO: STOCK SHOT OF WAVES BREAKING ON A BEACH  FADE TO: EXT – OCEAN – DAY  The skipper and Gilligan are standing on the raft far out to sea with no land in sight.  GILLIGAN I'm flipping my lid I tell ya! Everywhere I look, it's water water water!!  SKIPPER You stop that Gilligan, that's an order!  GILLIGAN Well I'm sick of orders! And I'm sick of the sun and the wind and the spray and the salt!  SKIPPER What are you talking about!? We've only been gone twenty minutes!  GILLIGAN Gee is that all?  The skipper has had it with Gilligan.  SKIPPER Now sit down there and start paddling! Dig in! FAST!  Gilligan does what he's told and starts paddling as we…  FADE TO: EXT – BEACH – DAY  Mary Ann and the professor are standing on the beach scanning the horizon for the skipper and Gilligan.  MARY ANN How do you think they're doing professor?  PROFESSOR Awe it's hard to tell, but at least they've had calm seas for the past three days.  MARY ANN Ooooo I hope they'll get through. They've got a good raft, and the skipper's a fine sailor and well…Gilligan is…oh I hope they'll get through.  FLIP TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The skipper and Gilligan are still on the raft far out to sea. The trip is beginning to take it toll on the crew.  SKIPPER No sign of land, sign of ships, no wind, nothing!  GILLIGAN Hey skipper? Let's have breakfast.  SKIPPER We had breakfast.  GILLIGAN Let's have lunch.  SKIPPER We had lunch.  GILLIGAN Let's have dinner!  SKIPPER AND GILLIGAN We had dinner too.  SKIPPER By the way, where are those tropical lei's the girls made for us?  Gilligan reaches over and picks up what's left of the lei's. Just a couple of loose vines with nothing left on them.  GILLIGAN I had a snack.  SKIPPER Gilligan will you stop talking about food!  GILLIGAN OK skipper. (pause) I wish I had something to drink. Like a hamburger, or French fries.  Gilligan looks down into the water and finds bottle.  GILLIGAN Hey, I wished for something to drink and there's a bottle. Maybe it's soda.  SKIPPER Maybe it's a bottle of beer!  Gilligan reaches out and takes the floating bottle.  GILLIGAN Yeah!  SKIPPER There's something in it!  Gilligan takes out the cork and removes the contents. He hands the cork to the skipper who promptly throws it away.  GILLIGAN Hey it's a note.  Gilligan takes the note out and start looking at it.  SKIPPER What is it?  GILLIGAN HELP, WE ARE MAROONED ON A DESERT ISLAND. They spelled marooned wrong.  SKIPPER Let me see that! Gilligan this is the note that you wrote!  GILLIGAN Oh yeah, I don't know how to spell marooned.  SKIPPER Errrr…give me that bottle!  The skipper takes the bottle and tosses it back in the ocean. Just then the crew notices several sharks approaching the raft.  SKIPPER We got company!  GILLIGAN I sure hope they had three meals today.  SKIPPER Where's that shark repellent? Didn't the professor say he was going to make some?  GILLIGAN Yeah, it was delicious.  SKIPPER (ANGRILY) Oh Gilligan get over there and start paddling!  The skipper and Gilligan are frantically trying to paddle the raft, but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. There are several sharks circling the raft and as Gilligan tries to paddle. A shark takes a bite out of Gilligan's paddle and he raises it up to look at it in horror.  SKIPPER Keep paddling!  GILLIGAN Skipper look!  SKIPPER Don't just stand there, keep paddling!  One of the sharks takes another large bite out of the end of Gilligan's paddle with a crunching sound. Gilligan lifts the paddle out of the water only to see that the paddle has been bitten completely off.  GILLIGAN Skipper!!  As the sharks continue to make their attack on the raft, they take large bites out of the raft. Gilligan takes out his knife and cuts the vines holding the raft together. The bamboo poles making up the deck start to slide off into the water. The skipper is picking up bamboo poles and tossing them into the water to distract the sharks. The raft is getting smaller and smaller and it is becoming difficult to stand on the deck. The skipper keeps falling over Gilligan in the process. As the raft gets smaller, Gilligan ends up hanging on to the mast for dear life. The skipper is trying to hold on to the mast also but there is barely enough room to stand. Gilligan and the skipper are now only barely staying afloat on what's left of their raft  FLIP TO: EXT – OCEAN – AFTERNOON  The skipper and Gilligan are still standing  on the remains of the raft as a storm develops.  SKIPPER Thought we'd never get away from those sharks!  GILLIGAN Thank goodness bamboo is filling.  SKIPPER We haven't got much raft left, but we'll get where we're going. We got a good current behind us.  GILLIGAN Yep skipper! From here on it looks like smooth sailing!  Just then a thunderclap and lightening strikes, along with a down pour occurs. The skipper and Gilligan are now standing on a sinking raft as it sinks deeper and deeper in the water.  GILLIGAN Skipper, do you think we should abandon ship!?  SKIPPER It's too late! It's already abandoned us!  The skipper and Gilligan are left standing on the sinking raft as we…  FADE OUT    ACT TWO  FADE IN  EXT – BEACH – MORNING  The skipper and Gilligan are seen emerging from the ocean in a tired and exhausted state. Gilligan is seen dragging a long bamboo pole with him. As they make their way on to the beach, they both collapse on their knees onto the sand, soaking wet.  SKIPPER You all right Gilligan?  GILLIGAN Oh I'm fine skipper.  The skipper notices the bamboo pole.  SKIPPER What's that?  GILLIGAN I saved the raft.  SKIPPER (STERNLY) Good work Gilligan.  GILLIGAN I wonder where we are.  SKIPPER I don't know, we must have traveled hundreds of miles. (pause) First thing we gotta do is build a fire.  GILLIGAN Oh yeah. Right skipper. I've got some matches right here.  Gilligan reaches in his pocket and pulls out a waterproofed package containing matches.  FLIP TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  The skipper has assembled some firewood and is waiting for Gilligan to bring a burning log over to get it going.  SKIPPER All right Gilligan, I'm all set here! Bring the fire! And don't let it go out!  GILLIGAN Aye, aye, skipper Oooo Ooooo! Take it! Take it! Take it please skipper! Take it! Takeittakeittakeittakeit!  Gilligan is bringing a burning log over to the skipper using only his hands. He is getting his hands burnt and fumbles it and hands it to the skipper who's hands are now burning as well.  SKIPPER Put it on the fire!  He finally ends up tossing the log down on the kindling.  SKIPPER What did you do that for!?  GILLIGAN It was hot!  SKIPPER Of course it was hot!  The skipper and Gilligan are standing around the fire warming themselves.  SKIPPER This is certainly better than that open beach out there.  GILLIGAN Yeah.  SKIPPER Well don't just stand there, bring some wood for the fire.  Gilligan turns to find some fire wood, but only comes back with green palm fronds and pieces of a green bush. He puts the wood on the fire which immediately starts to produce large quantities of white smoke that rises up.  CUT TO: EXT – BEACH – DAY  Mary Ann, Ginger and the professor are standing on the beach.  MARY ANN Professor, Ginger oh, look, oh there's smoke on the other side of the island!  CUT TO: SMOKE RISING FROM OVER HILL  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  PROFESSOR Girls I'm afraid we may be in for some trouble. There's a chance the Marubi may have returned to this island.  MARY ANN Those head hunters!? Oh golly professor what do we do!?  GINGER The first thing we ought to do is hide our heads!  PROFESSOR I want you girls to gather up some of these Conch shells and meet me at the clearing!  MARY ANN But but…  PROFESSOR At the clearing! I'm going to warn the Howell's about this!  The professor, Ginger and Mary Ann walk off camera as we…  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  The skipper and Gilligan are walking through he jungle when the skipper happens upon tracks in the sand.  CUT TO: SHOT OF FOOT PRINT IN THE SAND.  SKIPPER (O.S.) Gilligan look!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Gilligan comes over to see what the skipper wants and see the foot prints as well.  GILLIGAN Hey that's pretty good skipper! How did you make the other foot prints!?  SKIPPER Those aren't mine!  GILLIGAN Well they sure aren't mine, I don't have that many feet!  SKIPPER There are other people on this island.  GILLIGAN Oh great lets go find 'em!  SKIPPER WAIT!  GILLIGAN Huh?  SKIPPER Remember what the professor said about the Marubi headhunters?  GILLIGAN Yeah!  SKIPPER Suppose they live on this island?  GILLIGAN (SLUMPS DOWN) Yeah.  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGEL CLEARING – DAY  Mr. And Mrs. Howell are standing on a make shift putting green. Mr. Howell is putting and the avocado pit misses the hole.  MR HOWELL Oh dash it all Lovey I've free putted again!  MRS HOWELL Well I think your doing very well dear, considering your using a clam shell on a bamboo stick for a putter.  MR HOWELL Not to mention an avocado pit for a ball. Here, I'll…I'll try it again.  Just as Mr. Howell is going to put the professor yells out…  PROFESSOR (O.S.) Mr. Howell!?  MR HOWELL QUIET please!  The professor runs on camera from behind the Howell's.  PROFESSOR But Mr. Howell!  MRS HOWELL (QUIETLY) Shhhhhh professor! Mr. Howell is putting.  PROFESSOR I know but I got important news!  MR HOWELL Not while I'm putting.  PROFESSOR Mr. Howell, I believe the Marubi may be here.  MR HOWELL I don't care who's here, they are not playing through!  MRS HOWELL Thurston, I believe the Marubi are those nasty headhunters the professor told us about.  PROFESSOR I think it's advisable we prepare a defense.  MR HOWELL Well as I always say a good defense is a strong offense. Wipe the buzzards out before they can attack us!  PROFESSOR Yes but how?  MR HOWELL Simple! First we blow up their bridge!  PROFESSOR Mr. Howell I don't even know if they have a bridge.  MR HOWELL Those crafty devils they've out smarted us already. Alright stand back, quiet please.  Mr. Howell has gone back to putting as Mary Ann approaches.  MARY ANN (O.S.) Professor, oh professor!  Mary Ann and Ginger run on camera.  MARY ANN We got the Conch shells!  PROFESSOR Oh good!  The professor takes the Conch shell from Mary Ann and inspects it.  PROFESSOR Good! Now these shells will be our warning system. And if you run into danger just blow into them like this.  The professor raises the Conch shell to his mouth and blows. The shell lets out a loud howl which can be heard for miles.  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  Gilligan and the skipper are still walking through the jungle when they hear the Conch shell horn sound.  GILLIGAN What's that!!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The professor has issued the Conch shells to everyone and has given them instruction on how to use it.  PROFESSOR Now lets all try it just to make sure.  Ginger, Mary Ann, the professor and Mr. And Mrs. Howell all start to blow into the Conch shells.  The sound of all the shell together is very eerie and ominous.  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  The skipper and Gilligan are listening to the howl of the horns and getting frightened.  SKIPPER Must be the wail of the Marubis!  GILLIGAN Oh no!  SKIPPER Oh yes! We better camouflage ourselves!  The skipper and Gilligan are trying to camouflage themselves by placing leaves and branches under their hats and in their clothes. In the background the wail of the Conch shell horns can still be heard. The skipper is trying to shove a branch down the back of Gilligan's shirt but Gilligan is ticklish and is giggling.  SKIPPER Oh stop that Gilligan, this is no laughing matter!  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – CAVE OPENING – DAY  The professor has led the others to the mouth of a small cave somewhere in the jungle growth.  PROFESSOR Now this is the cave where I found the Marubi arrowhead. Might be safe in there.  Ginger looks inside the cave.  GINGER My, looks dark in here!  PROFESSOR It is! Pitch dark! It'll make a wonderful hiding place. (Pause)  The professor looks at the outside of the cave and ponders.  INSERT: SHOT OF ROCK FACE ABOVE THE CAVE ENTRANCE  PROFESSOR (O.S.) And with those rocks…  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  PROFESSOR I think I can, rig a pretty interesting trap for our Marubi friends.  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE - DAY  We see that Gilligan is wearing a tree trunk while the skipper is dressed as a bush.  SKIPPER Hold Still Gilligan!  GILLIGAN I sure hope this island doesn't have any Termites!  SKIPPER At least we'll be safe like this so we can scout around and see what's what.  GILLIGAN Yeah.  Gilligan is having trouble moving in his "tree" costume.  GILLIGAN Skipper I think you made my roots too long!  SKIPPER Never mind! Just take short steps like this.  The skipper takes small steps and keeps moving around in circles.  SKIPPER How do I look?  GILLIGAN Like a fat bush!  SKIPPER When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it!  GILLIGAN You just asked for it.  SKIPPER OH SHUT UP!  GILLIGAN Shhhhhh!  SKIPPER Remember now, if there's any danger just stand still and you're a tree!  Suddenly a tropical bird lets out a screech and scares both nearly to death. Gilligan takes off at a frantic pass.  SKIPPER Gilligan come back here!  CUT TO: EXT – CAVE OPENING – DAY  The professor is finishing his trap as Ginger brings more leaves and branches to conceal the vine.  GINGER Here's some more.  PROFESSOR Good! Start spreading these around but be careful, it's all set. Now the vine is the trigger. It goes over here, around the tree stump, up here, over to here, and is attached to these two small rocks.  GINGER And if anyone tries to get into the cave…  PROFESSOR The minute they touch that vine, it creates a tension, out come these two rocks and the WHOLE thing comes tumbling down on them.  GINGER That's a wonderful trap professor!  PROFESSOR Be careful now. It's all set to go.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  The skipper is searching for Gilligan after he ran off scared.  SKIPPER Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Over here skipper!  The skipper trips over a rock and falls over as he moves towards Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Watch the rock skipper!  SKIPPER (SARCASTICALLY) Thanks a lot Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Are you alright!?  SKIPPER I'm fine. Just fine! (pause) I got to rest a second. Will you stop going so fast!?  GILLIGAN OK skipper.  SKIPPER From now on we'll stick close together. (PANTING) Did you see anything? (Pause) Well?  GILLIGAN Skipper?  SKIPPER What.  GILLIGAN I've been attacked!  SKIPPER Attacked!?  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Yeah.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN IN HIS TREE. NEAR HIS HEAD IS A WOODPECKER.  GILLIGAN By a woodpecker.  The woodpecker is pecking away at the side of Gilligan's head.  GILLIGAN Shooo!  Shooo!  The woodpecker just keeps on pecking. Finally Gilligan has had enough.  GILLIGAN HEY!  The woodpecker stops.  GILLIGAN Are you going to keep peckin my head?  The woodpecker responds by nodding up and down as if to say yes. It then goes back to pecking Gilligan's head. Gilligan gives up.  CUT TO EXT – SAME JUNGLE AREA – DAY  The professor and the girls are making their way through the jungle when suddenly the professor spies something.  PROFESSOR Wait!  GINGER What?  PROFESSOR That tree over there moved!  The professor raises his bow and lets loose an arrow.  QUICK PAN TO: GILLIGAN BEING HIT IN THE TREE TRUNK BY THE ARROW.  Gilligan's arms extend straight out when he's hit with the arrow. He and the skipper take off through the jungle.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  GINGER The tree ran away!  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  The skipper in his bush and Gilligan in his tree run off into t he jungle.  GINGER (O.S.) And there goes a fat bush!  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  PROFESSOR It IS the Marubi! They often disguise themselves. We better warn the others!  The professor starts blowing his Conch horn to warn the others he's encountered the Marubi.  CUT TO: EXT – JUNGLE – DAY  Gilligan and the skipper hear the wailing horn and react.  GILLIGAN Skipper! There gonna attack any minute! I'm getting out of this tree!  SKIPPER Now is no time to panic Gilligan!  GILLIGAN It's as good a time as any!  THE Conch shell horn can still be heard as we…  FADE TO: EXT – CAVE AREA - DAY  The skipper and Gilligan have removed their camouflage outfits and are making their way through he jungle. The skipper stops as they happen upon the cave the professor found earlier. Gilligan runs into the back of him.  SKIPPER Will you watch where your going!   GILLIGAN What did you stop for skipper?  SKIPPER Look Gilligan a cave. We can hide in the cave! (PAUSE) Well what are you waiting for?  Gilligan won't go in the cave.  GILLIGAN The skipper always leads his crew.  SKIPPER Gilligan get in the cave!  GILLIGAN Wait, wait, I got a great idea. (pause) Why don't we fix a trap with these rocks. Fix'em so they fall down on the Muribi, an…and we can…we can use a vine, look just like this one here see? Good idea?  SKIPPER What a ridiculous scheme. Do you really think that you can take vine, run it along the ground here, over this tree stump, up along side the cave, and tie it into these rocks so that all these rocks fall down.  It finally dawns on the skipper that what he just said is actually a trap and does a double take.  SKIPPER It IS a trap! Must have been set by the Marubi! Gilligan now I know we'll be safe in that cave. When the Marubi come back, see that their trap isn't sprung, they'll go away!  The skipper and Gilligan enter the cave with Gilligan going first.  SKIPPER Watch the vine!  They enter the cave and are now out of sight.  SKIPPER (O.S.) What are you stopping for?  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Skipper…  SKIPPER (O.S.) Never mind I'll go ahead!  Just then we hear a crunch.  SKIPPER (O.S.) Ooooomf!  GILLIGAN (O.S.) There's a low rock there!  SKIPPER (O.S.) Thanks a lot Gilligan! (pause) Cut that out!  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Yes sir.  SKIPPER Quit it!!  GILLIGAN Aye, aye!  And again we hear a head splitting crunch.  SKIPPER Oooomf!  GILLIGAN Another one.  CUT TO: SAME AREA NEW VIEW POINT  Just then the professor, Mary Ann, Ginger and Mr. and Mrs. Howell run on camera near the cave entrance. The professor is directing the others into the cave.  PROFESSOR Hurry!  GINGER Here we go!  PROFESSOR Now be careful of this vine. It's the trap I told you about. Careful. Right into the cave. You'll be perfectly safe in there.  MR HOWELL Good heavens.  The professor helps the others enter the cave one by one until all are out of sight. Suddenly there is an outburst of yelling, screaming and Conch shell horn sounds. It's apparent that Mr. and Mrs. Howell, Mary Ann, Ginger and the professor have met up with Gilligan and the skipper. Each of them believes they have met with the savage Marubi and are fighting back. This continues for quite some time. The skipper is ejected from the cave as the fighting goes on. As he reenters the cave he passes Mr. Howell who is being ejected also. Mr. Howell reenters the cave and then Gilligan and the professor are ejected from the cave at the same time. The professor starts back in when Gilligan notices him.  GILLIGAN Hey don't go in there mister, there's Marubi in there!  PROFESSOR Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Professor, what are you doing on this island!?  PROFESSOR Well we've always been on this island!  GILLIGAN Oh, than that must be us in there! I better go tell'em!  PROFESSOR Be careful of that vine! It's a trap!  GILLIGAN I know!  Gilligan goes back in the cave. There is more yelling and horn blowing. Gilligan gets ejected from the cave once again.  GILLIGAN They threw me out!  PROFESSOR I'll tell'em you stay here!  The professor is next to try to stop the fighting. He starts to enter the cave.  GILLIGAN Be careful of the vine it's a trap!  The professor comes back out of the cave.  PROFESSOR I know!  He goes back in. After a few more moments of fighting it gets quiet.  PROFESSOR (O.S) All clear Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Oh boy it's good to be home again!  Gilligan then starts running back into the cave but trips on the vine in the process.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF CAVE ENTRANCE AS VINES PULLS THE TWO ROCKS OUT SETTING OFF THE TRAP  CUT TO: CLOSE UP CAVE ENTRANCE  The trap works as rocks, dirt and debris fall down in front of the entrance with a loud rumbling sound. All we see at the end is a huge cloud of white dust as we…   FADE OUT        EPILOG FADE IN  SAME SHOT AS FADE OUT  We see the cave entrance piled high with small rocks. There is only a small opening at the top, and the skipper has already squeezed through. The professor is starting to emerge from the opening as the skipper helps him.  SKIPPER Let me give you a hand. Oh, that Gilligan! It's all his fault!  PROFESSOR I, warned him about that vine!  Both are now free of the cave as they standby to assist the others from the cave. Mary Ann is the next to emerge.  SKIPPER Watch yourself now Mary Ann. Don't scrape your back.  PROFESSOR Careful, careful. Are you all right?  MARY ANN I think so.  SKIPPER Watch your ankles.  Mary Ann has emerged and is looking rather beaten. Ginger is next to be helped from the cave.  PROFESSOR Are you hurt?  SKIPPER Careful Ginger.  GINGER No, I'm all right.  Ginger is inspecting her torn dress.  GINGER But look at my dress! It's the only dress I have. It's ruined!  Mrs. Howells parasol starts to emerge from the cave.  SKIPPER Oh that Gilligan! Careful Mrs. Howell.  RS HOWELL Thank you captain.  PROFESSOR Are you well?  MRS HOWELL Not very.  PROFESSOR Careful.  SKIPPER Watch yourself now.  Mr. Howell is next to come through the opening and is complaining the whole time.  MR HOWELL Tremendous…I thought we had been…Ohhhh!  SKIPPER Careful Mr. Howell  MR HOWELL Reminds me of the back nine…  PROFESSOR (TO SKIPPER) Careful with him.  SKIPPER Watch your step…that's it. Well where's Gilligan!  Gilligan knows he's in trouble and doesn't want to come out.  SKIPPER I'm gonna count to three, if you don't come out, I'm gonna come in and getcha!  One!  Two!  THREE!  Just as the skipper says three, a hideous face appears in the opening. It's not Gilligan, but the masked face of a Marubi. The masked face lets out a horrible roar. Every one starts to scream and run into the jungle. The Marubi, complete with grass skirt, necklace and menacing mask, makes it's way out of the cave and stands in the clearing waving his arms menacingly.  CUT TO: SAME AREA – ANGLE ON SKIPPER  The skipper, being the last to run stops and turns around to see the Marubi. The Marubi lets out one last hideous Roar. The skipper has now been frightened in to running away down the path.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT – CLOSE UP OF MARUBI  The Marubi stand full face before the camera when he suddenly lifts his mask to reveal it's only Gilligan dressed as a Marubi.  GILLIGAN Skipper gone. Gilligan one smart Marubi!  Gilligan, dressed as a Marubi is left standing near the cave smiling smugly to himself as his mask falls back down into place. He looks back and forth as we…   FADE OUT   END CREDITS GILLIGAN'S ISLAND Two on a Raft 
Episode #57, "Gilligan's Living Doll" (An experimental robot launched by the Air Force parachutes onto the island.)   GILLIGAN’S ISLAND   "Gilligan's Living Doll"  By  Bob Stevens    Air Date: February 10. 1966    TEASER  FADE IN: EXT - HUT - DAY - CREDITS OVERLAYED  Gilligan is seen riding the bike unit that is powering the washing machine.  The skipper is lying on a lounge near the hut obviously doing very little.  SKIPPER How do I get these crummy jobs!  Laundry is a WOMAN'S job.  After all a man works his way up to be the captain of his own ship...he should get a little respect!  I'll take that back...a whole lot of respect!  Why a captain rates a salute...not a, hey you!   For goodness sakes I always GET assignments I should be giving 'em out!  If anybody on this island is entitled to something that...  During the skipper self pity speech, Gilligan appears to be concerned about something and gets off the bike. He opens the washing machine and is search for something.  The skipper finally notices what Gilligan is doing.  SKIPPER Gilligan?  GILLIIGAN what are you doing!?  Gilligan finally finds what he's been looking for.  GILLIGAN Thought I lost it!  Gilligan pulls out a rabbit's foot from the washing machine.  SKIPPER Lost what?  GILLIGAN My good luck charm.  Gilligan is squeezing out the water and flicking it on the skipper.  SKIPPER Gilligan that's an old wives tale.  GILLIGAN No it's isn't, it's a rabbits foot!  SKIPPER I know exactly what it is but anybody that would think that that would bring them good luck has got to be out of their mind!  GILLIGAN I believe it!  SKIPPER I know, that's exactly what I mean! No get back to the laundry!  Gilligan is still squeezing out the water and heads back to the bike unit.  GILLIGAN I wonder if it works when it's wet?  The skipper now aggravated gets up and grabs Gilligan and leads him back to the bike unit.  SKIPPER Gilligan are you gonna let me put you in the drivers seat or are you gonna get up there!?  Gilligan gets back on the bike and starts to peddle.  SKIPPER Now that's better...now let's finish this laundry.  As Gilligan is peddling, he looks up and notices something in the sky.  GILLIGAN Hey Skipper!? It works it works!  SKIPPER What works, what is it you're talking about?!  GILLIGAN It works even better when it's wet...look!  INSERT: SHOT OF A MAN COMING DOWN IN A PARACHUTE  SKIPPER For goodness sakes that nothing but a man in a parachute now will you start peddle... A man in a parachute!  GILLIGAN Yeah skipper!  We're rescued we're rescued!  Gilligan starts to kiss his rabbits foot and the skipper tries to get the parachutists attention.  GILLGIAN Oh boy!  SKIPPER Down here!  Over here!  INSERT: SHOT OF A MAN COMING DOWN IN A PARACHUTE  GILLIGAN (O.S.) Oh yeah!   FADE OUT:       ACT ONE  FADE IN: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The skipper and the professor are out in the jungle searching for the downed parachutist.  SKIPPER Oh professor did you find anything?  PROFESSOR Not a sign.  SKIPPER I'm sure that parachutist came down dead center...he should be right on this part of the island.  Gilligan is seen running on camera carrying a magazine.   GILLIGAN Skipper!  I found it I found it!  SKIPPER Where!? Where!?  GILLIGAN Right here right here!  Gilligan holds up the magazine.  PROFESSOR Gilligan that's a comic book!  GILLIGAN I know, it's my favorite one...I lost it.  SKIPPER You're a great help!  Come on professor let's check over here.  PROFESSOR You know he could've gotten tangled in a tree.  SKIPPER Well certainly he could've.  Gilligan you go look that way!   GILLIGAN Alone?  SKIPPER Well certainly alone. Why not alone?  GILLIGAN Because I'm at the scary part.  You see here Fossil Face has Davy Davis All-American boy. See that!  SKIPPER Oh never mind the comic book!  Go that way!  PROFESSOR Skipper? Are you sure you saw someone parachute down?  SKIPPER I'm positive professor.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan is walking alone reading his comic book.  He's not aware of where he's going.  GILLIGAN Ah ha Fossil Face.  Just because you have Davy Davies tied to the buzz saw and because you have his tried and true buddy...friendly and lovable Lester Al Lewis tied to the railroad tracks does not mean that...  Gilligan turns the page.  GILLIGAN Oops, I guess it does.  Gilligan continues to walk and read as he walks into what appears to be a robot still attached to the parachute harness. The parachute risers lead off to the parachute caught in a tree. Gilligan doesn't notice it.  GILLIGAN Oops, excuse me sir...  Gilligan looks up and sees the robot.  GILLIGAN It's Fossil Face!! It's Fossil Face...  Gilligan runs away from the robot and gets caught up in the parachute.  He frantically tries to get loose.  GILLIGAN I give up!  I give up!  I give up!  I give up!  Gilligan gets himself untangled and takes a look at the robot.  He approaches the robot with caution and examines it.  GILLIGAN Hello.  ROBOT HELLO  GILLIGAN My name is Gilligan.  ROBOT MY NAME IS GILLIGAN  GILLIGAN Hey! We both have the same name!  ROBOT HEY   WE BOTH HAVE THE SAME NAME  GILLIGAN Professor!  Skipper!  I found him! Her...it... Skipper professor I found it! I found it I found it!  SKIPPER All right Gilligan for goodness sakes you don't have to yell I know that you found it...  The skipper finally sees what Gilligan found.  SKIPPER A robot!?  GILLIGAN Yeah!  SKIPPER Oh for goodness sakes that's just what we needed...a tin fugitive from the Wizard of Oz!  The professor finally arrives on the scene.  SKIPPER Oh professor, meet our rescuer. PROFESSOR Well that's fantastic!  GILLIGAN Huh?  PROFESSOR Well it's obviously an experimental model. The Air Force must be using it for some sort of survival test.  GILLIGAN It's a real live robot!  SKIPPER Gilligan, robots aren’t alive!  GILLIGAN This one is cause it can talk!  SKIPPER Yes and I'm sure you two will have very interesting conversations together.  PROFESSOR Robots have been programmed to talk.  SKIPPER I know but if I was ever seen talking to this refuge from a junkyard...they'd think the skipper lost all his marbles!  ROBOT THE SKIPPER LOST HIS MARBLES  PROFESSOR Why, it must have a blank roll of tape and an automatic relay mechanism.  GILLIGAN You mean what ever I say to it, the robot will repeat it back?  PROFESSOR Yes!  SKIPPER Oh great.  We've got a mechanical Gilligan!  GILLIGAN I wonder what else they made it do?   PROFESSOR Gilligan!  You just hit upon the key word...they!  They sent it up, and they'll come looking for it.  And when they do...  SKIPPER They'll come and rescue us! They'll rescue us! Robot robot you're beautiful!  ROBOT YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL  SKIPPER Thank you...  GILLIGAN Come on! Let's go tell the others!  Gilligan grabs the robot by the arm and tries to pull it but it doesn't budge.  SKIPPER Gilligan for goodness sake that thing must weigh a thousand pounds!  PROFESSOR Well if can talk it must be programmed to walk.  GILLIGAN Yeah let's try it. Robot...follow me!  The robot doesn't move.  GILLIGAN Robot, walk!  The robot raises it's arms, lifting Gilligan partly off the ground and begins to walk.  Gilligan, now trapped, walks on tiptoes trying to walk ahead of the robot.  GILLIGAN That way!  Gilligan points, and the robot turns.  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - DAY  The robot is standing in the middle of the hut as the professor is examining it. Gilligan watches on.   GILLIGAN But you haven't asked it any important questions like who won the World Series or the Rose Bowl or anything.  PROFESSOR Well I asked informative questions and I got informative answers.  GILLIGAN Yeah. (Trying to sound like the robot) I WAS LAUNCHED FROM HICKHAM FIELD HAWAII PURPOSE RADIATION DETECTION FLIGHT DESTINATION VANDENBERG AIR BASE CALIFORNIA  PROFESSOR Well we also learned its model XR one thousand...and what's more important, I think I've solved the schematic problem.  GILLIGAN Is that good?  The professor now gives the robot verbal commands.  PROFESSOR Raise your right arm!  The robot raises its right arm.  So does Gilligan.  PROFESSOR Ah yes the schematic pattern is the key to how to activate it.  Raise your left arm!  The robot raises its left arm...so does Gilligan.  PROFESSOR Gilligan the possibilities are unlimited, and until the Air Force finds our friend, we can put it to all sorts of uses!  GILLIGAN Will it bring water from the spring?  PROFESSOR Raise your left leg!  The robot raises its left leg...and of course so does Gilligan.  PROFESSOR I believe I can program it to do all the unpleasant tasks on the island!  GILLIGAN Even the laundry?  PROFESSOR Twirl your right arm!  The robot twirls its right arm...and again so does Gilligan.  PROFESSOR Gilligan, this mechanical marvel can be taught to do everything a man can do...and it can do it better!  FLIP TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Mary Ann is in their hut along with the robot. Mary Ann has a broom and is showing the robot how to sweep.  MARY ANN Now you sweep like this...back and forth, back and forth.  Mary Ann hands the broom to the robot.  MARY ANN Sweep!  Back and forth, back and forth. Ooo this is going to be fun!  That's fine, that's fine!  Now sweep the other way.  The robot continues sweeping and is heading towards the hut wall. The robot doesn't respond to Mary Ann's voice commands.  MARY ANN Well turn around!  Well sweep the other way!!  The robot continues in a straight line right through the hut wall and into the clearing outside.  MARY ANN Oohh!!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Ginger is lying on a lounge near the hut while the robot does the dishes at the table.  GINGER Are you going to take all day?  Ginger gets up from the lounge chair and approaches the robot. She starts to fiddle with the controls located on the robot's chest.  GINGER Which one of these makes you go faster?  The robot starts to go much faster but isn't very accurate.  It starts throwing plates in every direction.  GINGER Oh!   Oooo!  Aaahhhh!  Aaahhhh!!  Ginger takes cover behind the lounge chair.  GINGER Help professor!  Help! HELP!! Aaahhh!!!!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The skipper and robot are standing next to the drum used as a washing machine.  The robot is loading the drum with clothing.  SKIPPER Now close the lid!  The robot closes the lid.  SKIPPER All right, get aboard and start peddling!  The robot mounts the bike unit used to power the washing machine and starts to peddle.  The skipper lays down on the lounge near the hut.  SKIPPER You are a captain's dream!  What a crew!  A crew that takes orders without questions...(he laughs)  The skipper relaxes and places his cap over his eyes. Gilligan walks on camera from the side of the hut.  He walks over to the skipper and raises his cap.  GILLIGAN Skipper?  Are you asleep?  SKIPPER Yes!  GILLIGAN When you wake up will you tell me if you've seen my rabbit's foot?  SKIPPER Have you lost that again!?  GILLIGAN Well if I hadn't lost it then I wouldn't have to ask you if you've seen it because I'd still have it.  SKIPPER Gilligan for goodness sake...  The skipper notices that the robot is gone.  It appears that Mr. Howell is going to use the robot for something far more important then laundry.  SKIPPER Mr. Howell!  Mr. Howell, come back here with that robot!  The skipper gets up and runs off camera after the robot.  Gilligan starts looking inside the washing machine.  SKIPPER Stop!  I'm...I'm not done with him I've got to have him finish the laundry! Now go back and finish the laundry!  The robot complies with the skippers orders and turns around and heads back to the washing machine.  MR HOWELL No...but the robot and Gilligan are caddying for us.  SKIPPER Oh no he's not his gonna do the laundry!  MR HOWELL No no Mrs. Howell is waiting at the first tee.  SKIPPER Well I'm sorry if Mrs. Howell is waiting, she'll just have to stay waiting.  Gilligan is looking in the washing machine for his rabbit's foot again.  MR HOWELL I'm willing to pay him double I don't understand.  The robot, having returned, dumps Gilligan headfirst in to the washing machine.  The robot, now back on the bike unit, is beginning to give Gilligan a good cleaning. Meanwhile Gilligan is upside down making all sorts of bubbling and gurgling noises.  SKIPPER What's that?  MR HOWELL Well it could be the mating call of the Red Crested Hickenlooper it's the season you know.  SKIPPER It was a call for help!  MR HOWELL Oh then its definitely not the call of the Red Crested Hickenlooper, he's quite capable of...  SKIPPER Over there...look!  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The lower half of Gilligan is seen sticking out of the washing machine.  It's being agitated back and forth as the robot peddles the bike.  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN'S FACE AS SEEN THROUGH THE PORTHOLE OF THE WASHING MACHINE.  CUT TO: EXT - PUTTING GREEN - DAY  Mr. and Mrs. Howell are playing golf.  They are at the green making ready to putt.  MR HOWELL A...darling my a...ball is in your line I'd...I'd better mark it.  Mr. Howell drops a marker for his ball quite far away from where his ball actually is and a lot closer to the hole.  MRS HOWELL I'm a long way away Mr. robot!  ROBOT IT WILL BREAK TOWARDS THE OCEAN ACROSS THE GRAIN DOWN HILL RIGHT OF THE PALM TREE PLAY IT THRE FEET TO THE RIGHT OF THE HOLE  MR HOWELL With those directions should knock it right off the island.  Mrs. Howell plays the shot just as the robot suggested, and although the ball seems to be possessed by spirits, makes it's way right into the hole.  DISSOLVE TO: STOCK SHOT OF PALM TREES.  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Everyone is either seated or standing around the communal table as the professor comes form around the hut with the radio.  PROFESSOR This is a very interesting news program coming in on the radio.  Listen to this everybody!  RADIO ...AND THE DRONE PLANE WHICH ACCIDENTALLY EJECTED THE ROBOT XR ONE THOUSAND, LANDED AT VANDENBERG AIRFIELD.  SINCE THE PLANE WAS OPERATED BY REMOTE CONTROL, THE OFFICIALS HAVE NO WAY OF KNOW THE AREA WHERE THE ROBOT WAS EJECTED.  THEY'VE ANNOUNCED THAT A SEARCH FOR THE ROBOT WOULD BE NEITHER ECONOMICAL NOR SUCCESSFUL, AND THEREFORE, NO SEARCH, WILL TAKE PLACE.  PROFESSOR Oh no.   SKIPPER And we thought that robot was gonna get us rescued.  GILLIGAN Well he's so smart maybe he can figure out something!  SKIPPER Gilligan for goodness sakes, robots don't think, they only do what you tell 'em to.  PROFESSOR That's it!  If we can figure out what to tell him, he could rescue us!  SKIPPER Are you serious!?  PROFESSOR I certainly am!  The professor walks up to the robot as if to ask a question.  PROFESSOR How would you like to do us a very big favor?  The robot indicates his willingness by nodding.  FADE OUT:       ACT TWO  FADE IN: STOCK SHOT OF HUT EXTERIOR.  CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY  The professor is examining the robot, which is bent over at the waist on the table.  Gilligan and the skipper are also present.  PROFESSOR I'm fixing the robot so that our auditory impulses will activate its memory spools...and in that way the particular problem poised will be answered.  The professor replaces the hatch cover on the robots back and tightens the thumbscrews.  PROFESSOR Well the simplest way to explain it is with a demonstration.  I think we can use him now.  SKIPPER Oh...well I'll help you get him up.  GILLIGAN A thousand pounds!?  SKIPPER Oh yes...a thousand pounds.  PROFESSOR Robot! Rise!  The robot rises from the table and stands upright.  PROFESSOR Now gentlemen, what is the most logical way to get off the island?  GILLIGAN The same way we got on...by boat!  SKIPPER Very good little buddy! I'm very proud of you!  PROFESSOR Exactly!  Now if it has the information of any of its spools, we'll get an answer.   Can you build a boat?  ROBOT YES I CAN  PROFESSOR And how long will it take you to build this boat?  ROBOT SEVENTEEN HOURS FOUR MINUTES ELEVEN SECONDS  SKIPPER WOW! That means we can be aboard early in the morning.  PROFESSOR Right!  All right build us a boat and start at once.  And that gentlemen, is that!  As the robot starts to turn and leave it steps on the skippers foot causing extreme pain.  SKIPPER Ooop! Aaah! Two Thousand pounds!  GILLIGAN A thousand pounds.  SKIPPER Whose foot is this anyway!  Don't just stand there Gilligan!   Go out there and tell the others to get packed!  FLIP TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - MORNING  The skipper, Gilligan, the professor and Mr. Howell approach the lagoon from down a path.  Each one carries luggage.  SKIPPER Can you beat that!?  The women still can't decide what to wear on the boat!  MR HOWELL You...you can't blame them you know, Bon voyage, first night out and all that sort of thing.  PROFESSOR I'm extremely curious to see the boat.  GILLIGAN What boat?  SKIPPER The boat he built!  MR HOWELL Well I can't see a thing!  GILLIGAN Maybe he built us a submarine!  ROBOT YOU DID NOT ASK FOR A SUBMARINE  SKIPPER Wa...well I don't think he built a thing!  MR HOWELL I'm going to speak to the head of your union! No more fringe benefits, no health or welfare.  No more nuts bolts or machine oil!  PROFESSOR Oh please Mr. Howell.  Did you build us a boat?  ROBOT YES  PROFESSOR Well where is it?  ROBOT IN THE LAGOON  PROFESSOR Well why can't we find it?  ROBOT YOU ARE NOT LOOKING IN THE RIGHT PLACE  MR HOWELL Well I'm sorry it's the only lagoon that we have!  GILLIGAN I found it!  I found it!  SKIPPER Look at the boat he built!?  GILLIGAN Gee isn't it neat!? It's a two masted schooner, and it's got two lifeboats and a binnacle and look, the pin rail!  PROFESSOR Oh it's my fault.  I should have specified the size and type of vessel.  MR HOWELL Well its not too late, perhaps he can build us a bigger ship!  PROFESSOR Well it's worth a try.  Can you build us a larger boat?  ROBOT I HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED TO BUILD A CARRIER DESTROYER OR MINE SWEEPER  MR HOWELL Well we might as well go first class. Build us a...carrier!  ROBOT A CARRIER REQUIRES FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND TONS OF STEEL  SEVEN THOUSAND TONS OF ALUMINUM...  PROFESSOR Reject! Never mind that last order!  MR HOWELL Perhaps if you said a...a pretty please!  PROFESSOR We're going to have to concentrate on some other device.  It's obvious the robot can't build a ship without steel.  Well...we'd better break the bad news to the girls.  MR HOWELL You goofed didn't you!?  ROBOT I AM NOT PROGRAMMED FOR THAT INFORMATION  MR HOWELL I wonder what next years models are gonna look like?  ROBOT I AM NOT...  MR HOWELL Oh shut up!  Mr. Howell Gets upset and pushes one of the buttons on the robot's chest.  MR HOWELL Power windows...  Gilligan approaches the robot with the model boat.  GILLIGAN I think you did a swell job.  ROBOT THANK YOU  FLIP TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  MR HOWELL There must be some way this robot can get us off this island.  If he were human, I'd offer him more money.  MRS HOWELL Thurston, I have the most marvelous idea!  MR HOWELL You have a plan?  MRS HOWELL The plan darling!  MR HOWELL Well what is it?  MRS HOWELL I'm not gonna tell anybody but the robot!  MR HOWELL Well come on, let's not keep the robot waiting!  Mr. Howell shows Mrs. Howell the door and hands her a boa that is on a table.  MR HOWELL Here you are my dear.  Oh, it's for you! Yes of course.  There you are my sweet.  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - NIGHT  Mr. and Mrs. Howell approach the robot.  MRS HOWELL Mr. Robot are you awake?  MR HOWELL Darling they don't have to sleep!  MRS HOWELL Oh, yes of course. A, Mr. Robot we'd like to leave the island.  ROBOT THAT INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN RECORDED  MR HOWELL Darling the idea, the idea.  MRS HOWELL Oh, yes of course.  Build us a bridge to Hawaii!  MR HOWELL Don't be ridiculous!  ROBOT A BRIDGE TO HAWAII CAN BE BUILT FROM MATERIAL ON THE ISLAND  MR HOWELL It can!?  MRS HOWELL Oh you see dear!  ROBOT IT WILL TAKE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY NINE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS  MRS HOWELL Eighty-nine years!? Thurston, do you realize how old I'll be?  MR HOWELL Yes, you'll be a little old to walk to Hawaii.  MRS HOWELL Oh dear I thought it was such a good plan.  MR HOWELL Eureka I have it!  MRS HOWELL Have what?  MR HOWELL A way to attract attention so people can find us!  Build us a searchlight!  Shine it on passing planes and ships.  ROBOT IMPOSSIBLE NO ELECTRIC POWER  MR HOWELL A...a flashlight?  ROBOT IMPOSSIBLE NO CARBON FOR BATTERIES  MR HOWELL Candles? Matches?  Two friendly fire flies... rubbing their little feet together?  The robot overloads, sounds a ringing bell and displays REJECT on his chest panel.  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Mary Ann and Ginger are discussing the robot.  MARY ANN Oh Ginger I think the plan is impossible.  GINGER WHY?  A girl can get a man to do all kinds of things for her.   MARY ANN I know, but robots aren’t human!  GINGER Neither were some of the guys I went out with.  MARY ANN The professor says that robots can't do any original thinking.  No matter HOW you ask them.  GINGER Well that's what makes it a challenge!  See you later.  Ginger heads out of the hut to look for the robot.  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - NIGHT  Ginger exits the hut and walks over to the robot that is standing outside their hut.  GINGER Hi ya tall dark and mechanical.  ROBOT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND  Ginger gets real close to the robot and puts her arms around it's neck as if to kiss it.  GINGER I'll make it a little clearer for you.  You see I've been stuck on this island for a long long time. Understand?  ROBOT I UNDERSTAND  GINGER And a...I want you to get me off.  ROBOT I AM NOT PROGRAMMED FOR THAT TASK  GINGER Well then...gee whiz...can't you put your mind to it?  I mean...concentrate for Ginger...can you? Just think of what it would mean for me to be back in Hollywood.  The robot starts ejecting smoke from what appear to be its ears.  GINGER I'll tell you what.  If you get me back to Hollywood, I'll introduce you to the swingingest lady robot you ever saw.  For Ginger?  Huh?  Come on...please?  The robot becomes overheated, displays TILT on its chest panel, starts to smoke out its "ears" and its antenna paddles start to oscillate back and forth.   GINGER Mmmmm...now your going.  I think you're beginning to register.  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan is in the top hammock and the skipper is in the bottom hammock.  They've been discussing what to do with the robot.  SKIPPER Gilligan, that's one of the silliest ideas I ever heard!  GILLIGAN I thought it was pretty good myself!  SKIPPER And what's the robot suppose to use to build a radio station?  Bamboo and coconuts?  GILLGIAN Well maybe he could swim to Hawaii and buy some tubes and wires and stuff like that.  SKIPPER Gilligan if he could swim for goodness sakes, we wouldn't NEED a radio station.  We could program him to tell the authorities all about u...oh that's the silliest thing I ever heard for...Wait a minute that's it!  Little buddy that's it!  You did it again!  GILLIGAN What did I do what did I do what did I do!?  SKIPPER Well if we can get it to swim to Hawaii, our worries are all over!  GILLIGAN Yeah, if we can solve one other problem.  SKIPPER Eh...What's that?  GILLIGAN Where we gonna find a bathing suit big enough to fit him.  SKIPPER Yeah, a bathing suit big enough to... Bathing suit!  The skipper realizing he's been baited again and gives Gilligan a disapproving glare.  FLIP TO: EXT - CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan and the professor are with the robot.  The robot and Gilligan are lying down on tables.  Gilligan is trying to get the robot to learn to swim.  GILLIGAN Try this robot!  Gilligan starts to demonstrate a swimming technique. The robot doesn't do very well.  PROFESSOR Awe its no use Gilligan.  It's arms and legs just won't work that way.  GILLIGAN Awe...How bout the Butterfly stroke...like that!  Gilligan demonstrates the Butterfly stroke to the robot and once again it doesn't look too good.  PROFESSOR Awe...the arms won't go over the head!  GILLIGAN Well...how about the sidestroke?  You know like that!  Ya know.  Once again Gilligan demonstrates the sidestroke to the robot but the results are the same.  Gilligan appears to have dropped something in the process.  GILLIGAN Ooops!  PROFESSOR What's the matter?  GILLIGAN I just dropped my rabbit's foot out of my pocket.  Gilligan gets up off the table to look for it.  PROFESSOR I thought I taught you not to pay any attention to those superstitions!  GILLIGAN But it brings me good luck!  PROFESSOR Luck Gilligan...is all in the mind.  GILLIGAN Professor, with my mind, I need all the luck I can get!  The skipper is seen walking on camera.  SKIPPER How's it going?  PROFESSOR Oh not very well skipper.  The robot just isn't built for swimming.  SKIPPER Eh...have you tried the Australian crawl?  GILLIGAN What do you mean crawl!?  He has to swim to Hawaii!  SKIPPER Very funny Gilligan.  PROFESSOR Oh we've tried the backstroke the breaststroke the sidestroke, everything and it's no use.  His arms and legs simply don't have the mobility of a man!  GILLIGAN Well neither does a dog and they can swim.  PROFESSOR Wait a minute!  Wait a minute the dog paddle that's it!  I mean it's a little slow, but I think his arms and legs can make those motions!  GILLIGAN Oh!  Well I'll try it huh?  SKIPPER Yes don't just stand there, get on there and show him how to do the dog paddle!  Gilligan gets up on the table again.  GILLIGAN Hey robot!  Robot!  Watch me robot!  Robot, like this!  Gilligan demonstrates the dog paddle to the robot who in turn tries.  It appears the robot is successful.  PROFESSOR Hey he's doing it skipper!  Look at that! Isn't that marvelous!?  SKIPPER That'll get him there!  DISSOLVE TO: EARLY MORNING SUNRISE AS SEEN THROUGH PALM TREES.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - EARLY MORNING  Gilligan, the skipper, the professor and the robot are seen walking into the lagoon clearing.  GILLIGAN I'm still half a sleep.  PROFESSOR Well I know it's early, but in case this fails, I don't want the others to be disappointed.  GILLIGAN How can they be disappointed if they don't know what we're doing?  SKIPPER Don't both trying to explain professor!  PROFESSOR All right, here goes for a trial run.  Now SWIM!  Go out twenty yards and return!  The robot starts to walk off camera as we...  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - MORNING  We see the robot enter the water with its arms making the dog paddle motions taught earlier.  The robot continues to sink deeper and deeper until its shoulders are still above the water.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - MORNING  The professor, Gilligan and the skipper continue to look on as the robot heads into the lagoon.  GILLIGAN Swim robot swim!  Swim!  That a boy! Keep swimming! Keep swimming!  That a boy!  The robot continues to make the dog paddle motions as it sinks completely below the surface not swimming a stroke.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - MORNING  GILLIGAN He sunk.  SKIPPER He didn't swim a stroke!  PROFESSOR Well it's his weight.  He can't generate enough speed to displace enough water to keep himself afloat!  GILLIGAN Maybe he's too heavy.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - MORNING  The robot is seen emerging from beneath the water.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - MORNING  SKIPPER Of all the silly ideas...swimming to Hawaii.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - MORNING  The robot is now completely out of the water and walks off camera.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - MORING  The robot walks on camera and up to the three men watching.  PROFESSOR Robot, stop!  The robot stops in front of them.  PROFESSOR Well, at least it proves he's watertight.  SKIPPER Let's try that message we gave him, see if it works.  PROFESSOR All right.  The professor pushes a button on the robot's chest panel.  The robot sends out a jet of water right into the professor's face.  GILLIGAN Watertight?!  ROBOT I HAVE BEEN ON A DESERTED ISLAND WITH SEVEN CASTAWAYS OF THE MINNOW  THEY ARE ALIVE AND WELL AND...  The professor pushes the button again and stops the message.  SKIPPER Perfect!  Now all we have to do is get him to swim to Hawaii!  PROFESSOR Well...back to the drawing board as they say.  GILLIGAN I don't say that.  SKIPPER He doesn't mean you Gilligan!  PROFESSOR There's just no way to get him to swim!  GILLIGAN Right!  The way he was going, he could have walked to Hawaii.  SKIPPER Walked?  PROFESSOR Walked?  FLIP TO: EXT - LAGOON CLEARING - DAY  All are present at the lagoon clearing along with the robot.  PROFESSOR I know this is an outlandish scheme but it seems to be our only hope.  MRS HOWELL Well the whole idea's preposterous!  PROFESSOR Well figuring the pressure of the water at it's deepest, the normal speed of the robot and the distance to Hawaii, I figure it should take him roughly a hundred and eleven hours.  MRS HOWELL Under water?! Why he could walk right by Hawaii without ever seeing it!  PROFESSOR Mrs. Howell it doesn't have to see!  It will stay on the direction it's been programmed to follow.  MARY ANN Well what about the valleys and the mountains under water?  PROFESSOR Well it has sonar to avoid undersea obstacles and an automatic pilot to get it back on course.  GILLIGAN What about sharks and other scary things down there?  PROFESSOR It has no human emotions Gilligan so it can't be frightened.  MR HOWELL By golly, sounds like our answer to Lloyd Bridges!  PROFESSOR However, I must remind you that it could run into an underwater mine and blow up or get tangled up in a fishing net.  So it's far from certain that it will reach Hawaii.  SKIPPER Well he's not going anywhere if we don't get him started.  PROFESSOR Right!  Robot walk!  The robot starts to walk off camera.  The castaways all start to sing and hum a Hawaiian farewell theme.  CUT TO: EXT - LAGOON - DAY  As the castaways continue the sing and hum the farewell theme, the robot is seen walking into the lagoon as we...  FADE OUT:         EPILOG FADE IN: EXT - HUT - DAY  All the castaways are present. Seated or standing around the communal table with the radio on it.  They are all adlibbing as the skippers hears the radio.  SKIPPER Wait a minute quiet! The announcement, quiet! Quiet!  RADIO ANNOUNCER AND NOW THEY ARE ACTIVATING THE ROBOT'S RECEPTOR SPOOLS TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND OUT HOW IT GOT TO HAWAII.  THE NEXT VOICE YOU HEAR WILL BE THAT OF THE ROBOT.  ROBOT I HAVE BEEN ON A DESERTED ISLAND THE PUT BREAKS TO THE RIGHT  MR HOWELL Well it was a lucky shot!  ROBOT SWEEP BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH I WAS STRANDED THIS IS THE WAY WE WASH OUR CLOTHES  RADIO ANNOUNCER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE SCIENTISTS FROM THE LABORATORY ARE CHECKING TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT WENT WRONG.  PERHAPS NOW WE CAN LEARN THE REASON THE RECORDED MESSAGES ARE ALL SCRAMBLED.  A WHAT!?  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BELIEVE IT OR NOT A RABBIT'S FOOT WAS JUST FOUND IN THE ROBOT!  Everyone is now looking directly at Gilligan who is shying away from their stares.  RADIO ANNOUNCER IT DEMAGNETIZED THE ENTIRE RECEPTOR SPOOLS. THERE IS NOW NO CHANCE OF FINDING OUT WHERE THE ROBOT HAS BEEN.  WHO REPROGRAMMED IT, OR HOW IT GOT TO HAWAII.  FOR THAT MATTER HOW THE RABBIT'S FOOT GOT IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE!  Everyone is now extremely upset with Gilligan and gives him even more intense dirty looks.  ALL (EXCEPT GILLIGAN) Gilligan!!!  GILLIGAN I just thought it'd bring us some luck ya know?!  They're about to grab Gilligan for a good pounding when we...   FADE OUT:   END CREDITS 
Episode #91, "High Man on the Totem Pole" (Gilligan and the Skipper find a totem pole and the head of it looks just like Gilligan.)  GILLIGAN’S ISLAND  "High Man on the Totem Pole"  By  Brad Radnitz   Air Date: February 27, 1967  TEASER  FADE IN: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Gilligan and the skipper are walking through the thick jungle trying to find their way back to their hut.  SKIPPER Maybe I'd better start finding our way back huh?  GILLIGAN Don't worry skipper, I know exactly where we are.  SKIPPER You do?  Where are we?  GILLIGAN We're lost!  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan!  Well judging from the sky, I think if we head directly east we'll eventually hit the beach.  Gilligan is in agreement but doesn't move much.  SKIPPER Yeah well go on.  Gilligan leads the way through the jungle but has problems with a large vine.  Through his struggles, the skipper too is entangled in the vine.  SKIPPER Will you leave that vine alone Gilligan!  The skipper gets things untangled and is getting impatient.  SKIPPER Move!  Gilligan continues through the jungle and is faced with a wall of foliage.  He parts the foliage and comes face to face with an ugly carved face.  Gilligan immediately lets out a yell, turns and runs into the skipper.  SKIPPER What is wrong with you!  GILLIGAN You...you lead the way!  The skipper takes the lead and parts the foliage as Gilligan did and sees the same ugly carved face.  The skipper reacts at the sight but realizes what it must be.  He parts the foliage farther to get a better look.  SKIPPER Must be some kind of a native totem pole.  GILLIGAN Did you ever see a meaner looking face?  The camera pans upward along the totem pole and stops at a carve head at the top.  SKIPPER Look at that horrible one.  GILLIGAN Yeah that's a horrible face and...that face is mine!  The carved head at the top looks exactly like Gilligan. The carved head is all we see as we...    FADE OUT:      ACT ONE  FADE IN: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY - CREDITS OVERLAYED  Gilligan, the skipper and the professor are in the jungle near the totem pole.  They are clearing away the foliage from around the totem pole.  PROFESSOR Ah...It’s a totem pole all right!  The professor examines the totem pole closely.  PROFESSOR Carved by the Kupaki.  GILLIGAN Kupa who?  PROFESSOR Ki.  SKIPPER Gilligan, can't you understand English? Kupaki!  GILLIGAN If that's English I went to the wrong school!  SKIPPER Professor, what is a Kupaki?  PROFESSOR Well they're a native tribe who inhabit the islands in this area.  SKIPPER Look at the head on the top of the totem pole...looks exactly like Gilligan!  PROFESSOR Yeah!  It's a little more ferocious perhaps, but it is an amazing likeness.  GILLIGAN And I didn't even pose for it!  SKIPPER That's really a good carving!  Those Kupakis must be handy with a knife!  PROFESSOR Oh they're handy with a knife all right.  Why they're the most ferocious tribe of headhunters in the south pacific!  GILLIGAN Do you mean that the people that carved that head...they're headhunters?  PROFESSOR That's right!  GILLIGAN Do you think they're advertising for me?  SKIPPER Looks exactly like Gilligan!  PROFESSOR Oh that's just a coincidence that's all. Gilligan may be a dead ringer for one of their kings.  GILLIGAN Don't say the word dead...not while I'm alive.  PROFESSOR Relax Gilligan!  Kupaki must have carved that totem pole many years ago.  SKIPPER Gilligan you'll really have it made if they ever come back!  Cause you look enough like one of those Kupaki to be one yourself!  DISSOLVE TO: INT - HUT - NIGHT  Gilligan is in the top hammock looking at himself in a small round hand mirror, while the skipper is in the lower hammock.  GILLIGAN Hey skipper?  How come nobody ever told me before I looked like a Kupaki?  SKIPPER Because anybody that knows what a Kupaki looks like, isn't alive to talk about it!  GILLIGAN I sure do look like one.  SKIPPER The professor said that was just a coincidence!  GILLIGAN Yeah, I know what he said!  But if two people have a face like mine, it's not a coincidence!  SKIPPER That's very true Gilligan.  It would be a catastrophe!  GILLIGAN I wonder if that old king was my great great grandfather or something.  SKIPPER That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!  GILLIGAN Yeah but if that old king on the pole, is my ancestor. That means I have headhunter's blood in me...  SKIPPER Will you knock it off!  GILLIGAN There is such a thing as...herdity!  SKIPPER That's heredity!  You look like him because of heredity!  GILLIGAN You see!  Even you think it was my ancestor!  SKIPPER Will you go to sleep!!  GILLIGAN Ok!  But if you wake up in the morning and you don't have your head, don't say I didn't warn you!  DISSOLVE TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Everyone is siting around the communal table talking about Gilligan's belief that he's a Kupaki.   SKIPPER ...So we've got a real problem!  GINGER You mean Gilligan thinks he comes from a long line of headhunters?  MARY ANN Oh that's ridiculous! He's the sweetest, most gentle boy I've ever known!  SKIPPER Well that may be so Mary Ann, but this morning he got up real early to go out and stare at his ancestor some more!  MRS HOWELL Oh pooh! If Gilligan was a headhunter, why would he settle with the head he has!?  SKIPPER Mrs. Howell believe me, he's really convinced he's a Kupaki!  MRS HOWELL Double pooh nonsense.  MR HOWELL Lovey, don't pooh pooh heredity or even give it a double pooh.  After all didn't I inherit my financial genius from dear old dad?  MRS HOWELL That's true.  All the money Thurston has, he inherited from his father.  MARY ANN Gilligan's not a headhunter and we all know it!  SKIPPER Oh that's fine Mary Ann, but how are we going to convince him of that!?  Gilligan is seen walking into clearing.  MARY ANN Shhhhh  Shhhhh Here he comes.  GINGER High Gilligan!  Would you like some breakfast?  How bout some scrambled eggs?  Gilligan does not acknowledge Ginger or anyone at the table.  He just walks past completely oblivious of his surroundings.  SKIPPER How would you like to go fishing this afternoon little buddy?  Gilligan still remains silent and continues to walk along.  MRS HOWELL Ah would you like to stay with Mr. Howell? You can count thousand dollar bills!  MR HOWELL And keep the ones that are upside down!  Gilligan hears nothing and walks off camera.  MARY ANN How are we gonna get Gilligan's attention away from that totem pole?  FLIP TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Mr. and Mrs. Howell are getting ready to go out for the day. They are seated in the back of a car made from bamboo.  Gilligan is seated in the driver's seat acting as a chauffeur.  MR HOWELL I assure you Lovey there's nothing like a relaxing drive in the country to make Gilligan forget that he's a descendant of headhunters.  (SOTTO) Shhhh, quiet.  A...any time your ready my boy.  GILLIGAN Any particular place Mr. Howell?  MR HOWELL No no just a drive the fresh air you know...anything you say.   INSERT: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN"S FEET PEDDELING THE CAR  Gilligan takes off with Mr. and Mrs. Howell in the back. He drives down a path with Gilligan peddling his heart out.  He finally comes to a stop for apparently no reason.  He stops just beyond the totem pole.  MRS HOWELL Well what's the matter Gilligan?  GILLIGAN My legs are tired!  MR HOWELL That's all right my boy conserve fuel.  After all we can only get thirty miles to a leg!  Thirty miles to a leg...I made a witty one!  (SOTTO) That'll make the boy forget his troubles.  Mrs. Howell fakes a laugh as Mr. Howell continues his adlibbing.  MRS HOWELL (SOTTO) Oh darling, we mustn't say anything that will remind him of those dreadful headhunters.  MR HOWELL (SOTTO) I pride myself on my tacit.  A...Gilligan?  I have great plans for you after we're rescued.  GILLIGAN Really Mr. Howell!?  MR HOWELL Yes...with my financial genius behind you, you'll bound to get ahead!  GILLIGAN A Head!  MRS HOWELL (SOTTO) Be careful what you say!  MR HOWELL (SOTTO) I made a fauxpas.  MRS HOWELL Oh Gilligan, Mr. Howell didn't mean what he said.  He was just talking off the top of his head.  GILLIGAN Head!  MR HOWELL Lovey!  MRS HOWELL I'm so sorry Gilligan.  I apologias from the tip of my toes to the top of my...  GILLIGAN Head!  MR HOWELL Gilligan, perhaps you'd better drive.  Gilligan start to drive once again but this time he ends up peddling in reverse.  INSERT: CLOSE UP OF GILLIGAN"S FEET PEDDLING THE CAR, BUT THIS TIME IN REVERSE.  Gilligan, now in reverse, back into the totem pole.  CUT TO: ANGLE ABOVE CAR, TOTEM POLE IN BACKGROUND  Mr. and Mrs. Howell and Gilligan are seen with their heads sticking out of the top of the car.  The carved head which looks like Gilligan's can be seen directly behind Mr. Howell.  MRS HOWELL Oh dear!  I do hope we're insured!  MR HOWELL Gilligan you'll have to be more careful look what you've done!  Lovey are you all...  Mr. Howell looks around and notices the totem poles head.  He starts to do a double take as he looks back and forth between the real Gilligan and the carved head.  MR HOWELL Wha...Gilligan!  He's over...a perfect set...they match!  FLIP TO: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is seen sitting and staring at the totem pole. Ginger approaches him with the idea of taking his mind off the carved head.  GINGER Hi Gilligan.  Would you like to take a nice long walk with me in the jungle?  GILLIGAN No thanks.  GINGER How about a cool refreshing swim? I'll wear by poke-a-dot bikini.  GILLIGAN I wonder if they shrink a lot?  GINGER If it did, there'd be only one dot left.  Gilligan is obviously not paying attention.  GILLILGAN What?  GINGER You asked me if my bathing suit shrinks a lot.  GILLIGAN No no, I was wondering if those headhunters shrink a lot of heads.  GINGER Oh Gilligan!  Look at me.  You know, they say the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  GILLIGAN No.  I never was very good at math.  Again, Gilligan doesn't seem to catch on that Ginger is trying to get his attention.  GINGER Gilligan.  Ginger is obviously getting frustrated with Gilligan's inattention and is in a huff.  GINGER Will you stop looking at that silly totem pole and look at me for a minute!  GILLIGAN Ok.  Gilligan now takes a long hard look at Ginger from bottom to top. Ginger, now having Gilligan's attentions tries to look sexy and she believes she's succeeded.  GINGER Now...what does that totem pole got that I haven't got?  Gilligan does a quick compare of Ginger and the totem pole.  He determines that what the totem pole has that Ginger does not is...  GILLIGAN Three heads.  Ginger, realizing she can't get through to Gilligan gives up.  GINGER You win!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The skipper and Ginger are seated at the communal table discussing Gilligan's obsession with the totem pole. The skipper is painting stripes on what appears to be a boomerang.  GINGER I tried, I really tried!  But all he thinks about are those heads!  SKIPPER You just left him standing there.  GINGER Well two's company, three's a crowd!  SKIPPER Well I made this boomerang for him.  I hope I can get him interested in this.  GINGER I hope that boomerang has more boom in it than I had!  FLIP TO: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is still seen standing near the totem pole just looking at it in a daze.  The skipper approaches with the boomerang he made.  SKIPPER Gilligan!  There ya are little buddy I've been looking all over for ya.  GILLIGAN Huh?  Gilligan does not see the skipper and continues to stare at the totem pole.  SKIPPER Look what I made for ya, a boomerang!  GILLIGAN Uh huh.  SKIPPER We...well come on, ya know how you had all that trouble losing things all the time?  GILLIGAN Uh huh.  SKIPPER Well...this you can't lose!  You throw it away and it comes right back to ya!  It's a boomerang! Get it!  You throw it away and it comes back!  GILLIGAN Skipper, I don't want a boomerang.  SKIPPER Well Gilligan now, yeh...it's a lot of fun really it is.  And of course it takes a lot of practice to learn how to throw one.  GILLIGAN Yeah but skipper I...I...I don't need a boomerang.  SKIPPER Well Gilligan, this isn't a toy ya know.  The natives use 'em to hunt with.  Gilligan now seems to perk up and take notice after hearing about natives and hunting.  GILLIGAN Do headhunters ever use them!?  SKIPPER Well I suppose they could use 'em, but...oh Gilligan we're not talking that seriously and besides it's just a t...  Gilligan, now hearing that headhunters could use a boomerang gets excited and takes the boomerang from the skipper.  GILLIGAN Ah...skipper I never threw a boomerang before can I try can I try?!  SKIPPER Yeah, try!  But be sure and watch where it goes now cause we gotta see where it lands, we can't lose it ya know!  Gilligan takes the boomerang and gives it a health toss.  The boomerang makes a whirring noise and it fly's around the clearing.  The boomerang makes it's way back the where it was thrown and heads for the skipper.  The skipper, being between the totem pole and the boomerang gets caught as the boomerang lodges itself in the totem pole and around the skipper's neck. The skipper appears to be truly frightened.  SKIPPER Gilligan, you almost cut my head off!  GILLIGAN I am a headhunter!  I knew it!  I am a headhunter!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  MARY ANN Skipper! Skipper! Professor! Oh! Skipper!  SKIPPER Mary Ann what is it!  MARY ANN Oh something terrible is gonna to happen!  SKIPPER Something terrible is gonna to happen?  MARY ANN Oh Gilligan just ran past me and he had a wild look in his eye!  PROFESSOR A wild look in his eye!?  MARY ANN And an axe in his hand!  SKIPPER An AXE!!  MARY ANN Uh-huh.  PROFESSOR We'd better go find him!  MARY ANN Oh I think he went that way!  Mary Ann points in one direction.  She then seems confused and points in another direction.  MARY ANN Maybe he went that way!  SKIPPER Oh...oh never mind, come on professor!  The skipper and professor take off into the jungle to look for Gilligan.  MARY ANN Oh he was so upset I don't know which way he went!  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The skipper and professor are walking quickly through the jungle, desperately looking for Gilligan.  SKIPPER We've got to find him professor, no telling what he'll do with that axe!  PROFESSOR I just can't believe that Gilligan is capable of violence.  Suddenly the skipper hears a sound that sounds like pounding or chopping.  SKIPPER What was that?  PROFESSOR I don't know but it sounds like it's coming from over there.  SKIPPER Come on lets go!  The skipper and the professor run off camera towards the sound as we...  CUT TO: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is seen standing on a make shift ladder chopping away at the carved head on the totem pole. The skipper and professor find Gilligan and witness him chopping off the head. Gilligan continues to chop until it eventually cuts loose and falls to the ground.  SKIPPER Not capable of violence huh!  The skipper and professor walk over to Gilligan and notice the head on the ground.  PROFESSOR Gilligan what are you doing!?  GILLIGAN I'm going to get rid of this totem pole!  SKIPPER But look what you've done!  GILLIGAN What'd I do!?  SKIPPER Yo...you've cut the head off!  Gilligan realizes what he's done and drops the axe as we...  FLIP TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan is seen packing his duffel bag with personal items as the skipper and the professor are looking on through the hut's window.  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The skipper and professor are still watching Gilligan pack his duffel bag.  SKIPPER (SOTTO) He's going to the other side of the island. He says he can't trust himself.  PROFESSOR Ah...he's convinced he all in instincts of a headhunter.  SKIPPER Well I'm convinced too!  I'll never forget the look on his face when cut down old grand pappy.  PROFESSOR Oh Gilligan has no native instincts either for headhunting or survival, and I'm not going to let him live alone on the other side of the island.  SKIPPER Well how are you gonna stop him?  PROFESSOR By literally putting my head on the chopping block.  SKIPPER What do you mean?  PROFESSOR Watch!  The professor leaves the skipper and enters the hut carrying a hand axe.  CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY  PROFESSOR Gilligan?  I've brought you a little going away present.  It's a hand axe.  Thought it might come in handy while you're out looking for trophies.  GILLIGAN Thanks professor.  I'm glad somebody believes I'm really a Kupaki headhunter.  PROFESSOR Why don't you start your collection with my head?  GILLIGAN Huh?  PROFESSOR I mean, I'd consider it an honor to be your first victim.  GILLIGAN Huh?  The professor bends over and lays his head down on the table as if to say chop off my head.  Gilligan doesn't know quite what to make of the professor's proposal and glances at the axe in his hand. The skipper, afraid of the outcome, covers his eyes with his hands.  PROFESSOR Come on Gilligan chop off my head.  I mean a real Kupaki wouldn't turn down the offer of a head.  Gilligan is obviously in turmoil between his belief of being a Kupaki and whacking off the professor's head.   Gilligan then raises the axe in a chopping motion and throws it out the hut's window, barely missing the skipper's head.  The skipper, realizing Gilligan isn't a headhunter races into the hut.  SKIPPER You couldn't do it little buddy! You couldn't do it!  GILLIGAN No I guess I'm not a headhunter.  The professor now still in one piece, looks relieved as well.  PROFESSOR And you're not a Kupaki?  GILLIGAN No, I'm a chicken, right down to the bone!  SKIPPER Now you know you're not related to that old king on the totem pole!  GILLIGAN Skipper?  You couldn't make me believe I was a Kupaki if I had to die to prove it!  CUT TO: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  The chopped off head of the totem pole is seen falling to the ground. Several natives are standing by.  NATIVE LEADER Who ever do this...   Die!!  CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF HEAD LYING ON THE GROUND AS WE...  FADE OUT:      ACT TWO  FADE IN: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  The natives are as we left them.  One of them picks up the chopped off head of Mashuka, their king.  NATIVE ONE Mashuka, great king!  Greatest headhunter of all!  NATIVE TWO Also very angry looking!  NATIVE LEADER Put that back on pole.  The native that picks up the head places the head back on the top of the totem pole.  NATIVE LEADER We find who do this!  CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan is sweeping the floor of the hut and making large clouds of dust.  He's whistling as he sweeps. Mary Ann enters the hut.  MARY ANN Hi Gilligan!  GILLIGAN Oh hi Mary Ann!  Mary Ann starts coughing due to the dust cloud.  MARY ANN Oh the dust!  I heard you whistling you must be happy.  GILLIGAN Yeah I am!  I finally realized how silly I was thinking I was a headhunter. And that's why I'm happy!  MARY ANN I'm happy, you're happy!  GILLIGAN I'm happy you're happy I'm happy.  In fact I was thinking how great that woodenhead, would look on the wall over there.  MARY ANN Oh you don't want that creepy thing in your room!  GILLIGAN Yeah!  When nobodies here, I could talk to myself!  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The skipper and professor are walking through the jungle discussing the carved head.  SKIPPER Professor do we really have to put that head back on the pole?  PROFESSOR Oh yes, because of Gilligan.  I'm mean for the moment he's forgotten all about that headhunting business. But would be better if he never saw any little reminders.  SKIPPER Yeah I guess so.  The skipper does a double take as he sees the three natives walking up the path.  SKIPPER Don't look now, but there are three big reminders headed this way! Quick come on, hide!  The skipper and the professor duck down and take cover behind some bushes and the three natives walk past.  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) Are they who I think they are?  PROFESSOR (QUIETLY) Yes!  They are real Kupaki headhunters!  CUT TO: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is seen walking into the clearing where the totem pole is.  GILLIGAN Hey Kupa King!?  Gilligan is looking around on the ground for the chopped off head and can't find it.  GILLIGAN Where'd your noggin go?  Kupa king!?  You and I can be friends.  I just want to take you back to my hut.  Kupa king!?  Kupa king?  Where'd it go?  Gilligan looks low then high and finally sees the head back on top of the totem pole.  GILLIGAN Hey, there it is.  How'd you get up there?  Never mind.  I don't want to know!  Gilligan starts to run off camera.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The skipper and the professor are still hiding behind the bushes watching the headhunters leave the area.  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) They were headed for the lagoon!  PROFESSOR (QUIETLY) Yeah, I'd better warn the others!  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) Wait a minute professor!  There may be more of them!  Gilligan is seen running down the same path taken by the headhunters.  The skipper sees him and reaches out and grabs him, placing his hand over Gilligan's mouth to keep him quiet.  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) Gilligan.  GILLIGAN Ahhhh! Skipper!  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) Shhhh Gilligan!  Don't make a sound!  GILLIGAN I don't want to say anything, but there's ghosts on the island!  SKIPPER Those aren’t ghosts Gilligan!  Those are real Kupaki headhunters!  GILLIGAN Now THERE'S good news...bye!  Gilligan turns around and starts to leave, but the skipper grabs him and turns him around.  PROFESSOR Wait a minute!  Now we got to warn the others!  We'll tell the Howells, and you go find the girls!  SKIPPER Exactly!  And above all, keep out of sight!  GILLIGAN Don't worry skipper.   Its times like this I'm invisible!  SKIPPER Yeah all right go on!  In their attempt to leave, Gilligan and the skipper end up running into each other before they get things sorted out and head off in their own directions.  FLIP TO: EXT - MUD BOG - DAY  Mary Ann and Ginger are up to their necks in mud taking what appears to be a mud bath.  MARY ANN Oooo, I've heard of mudpacks, but this is ridiculous!  GINGER Don't knock it honey, in Hollywood they charge twenty-five dollars a half-hour for this.  MARY ANN Twenty-five dollars!?  What have they got in it, Rock Hudson!?  Mary Ann and Ginger are now relaxing in the mud.  GINGER Oooo I love it!  MARY ANN Ok!  Gilligan is seen walking by the mud bog where Mary Ann and Ginger are relaxing.  Only their heads are visible sticking above the mud. Gilligan, seeing only their heads reacts in horror.  GILLIGAN Oh no! The headhunters got the girls!  I can't look!  Gilligan covers his eyes with his hands and turns around.  MARY ANN and GINGER Hi Gilligan!  Gilligan reacts with confusion at hearing the talking heads.  GILLIGAN Huh!!  MARY ANN What's the matter, you look like a ghost?  GINGER What's wrong with you?  GILLIGAN What's wrong with me?  Have you looked at yourselves lately?  GINGER How can we, we're covered with mud!  GILLIGAN Mud?  GINGER We're standing in a mud bog.  GILLIGAN Oh...I thought those headhunters got here efore I could.  MARY ANN Gilligan...are you trying to tell us there are real headhunters on this island!?  GILLIGAN Yeah!  The skipper and the professor saw them!  GINGER Quick!  Get us out of here!  MARY ANN Oh...help!  Gilligan starts to help Mary Ann out of the mud bog as Ginger is also trying to get out as we...  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE NEAR TOTEM POLE - DAY  We see the Howells being captured by the three natives and being lead to a location near the totem pole. The natives keep threatening the Howells with their spears. The Howells are resisting but with very little effect.  MR HOWELL Wait a minute! Wait a Minute! One moment please!  Stop waiving that thing in...in...in my wife's face! Have you no manners!?  MRS HOWELL Oh Thurston, why don’t you tell these poor souls that we don't need any Boy Scout equipment!  MR HOWELL Lovey I know how to deal with aborigines now one moment...you sir, the spokesman, how much to let Mrs. Howell...Mrs. How...hat, and me go free? A...a ten thousands Hmmm?  A hundred thousand?  Five Hundred thousand?  Oh come come every man has price now what is yours!?  NATIVE LEADER Kupa!  Buga Kupa!  MRS HOWELL Sounds terribly expensive!  MR HOWELL Oohhh!  The natives continue to push the Howells with their spears as the Howells complain in protest.  FLIP TO: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  The Howells are seen tied to a post with the totem pole just off to their left.  The natives are busy making ready a pot of boiling water.  It looks like they're getting ready for dinner.  MRS HOWELL Thurston I didn't know we were asked for dinner!  MR HOWELL I'm afraid my dear we ARE the dinner!  MRS HOWELL Can't you do anything to stop them!?  MR HOWELL No, I even offered then seats on the stock exchange!  MRS HOWELL And they turned you down!?  MR HOWELL Just as well.  They'd probably corner everything in the market! Especially the customers!  We see the natives sharpening their machetes on a large rock as we...  PAN OVER TO: SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  The skipper and the professor are hiding behind some bushes watching what the natives are doing.  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) The Kupakis have got Mr. and Mrs. Howell captive.  We've got to do something!  PROFESSOR Awe...it'd be too risky to try to overpower them.  SKIPPER Well of course if we got Gilligan it will make the sides even.  But of course on second thought...it...might make matters worse.  PROFESSOR Now wait a minute skipper you're wrong!  Gilligan can repulse them, simply by showing his face!  SKIPPER Oh come on professor!  I mean...Gilligan's no Cary Grant but...he certainly doesn't have a face like a Frankenstein's monster!  PROFESSOR No skipper that's not what I meant. Gilligan looks exactly like that Kupaki on the totem pole.  SKIPPER Well what about it?  PROFESSOR Well if he can convince the headhunters that he's really their dead king brought back the life, he can order them to release the Howells!  SKIPPER Hey yeah! He could save us a...save us all!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  The skipper, the professor, Mary Ann and Ginger are all standing around with Gilligan.  Gilligan is now made up to look like the Kupaki king.  SKIPPER Gilligan, you're a born Kupaki if I ever saw one!  MARY ANN Oh boy, one look at that face and they're gonna to know you're their king!  GILLIGAN But I'm not a king and I'm not a headhunter! Professor you convinced me of that!  PROFESSOR I know, but you've got to act like one!  GILLIGAN A dead one!  How's that gonna save the Howells!?  PROFESSOR Well you tell the natives to release their prisoners.  Now these natives are very superstitious. So as a king, your word is law.  GILLIGAN Then how come nobody pays attention to me!?  GINGER (TO SKIPPER) I think you better take a look and see if the Howells are all right.  SKIPPER All right but hurry it up! Cause before you finish off Gilligan, they're apt to finish off the Howells!  The skipper takes a headpiece made from bamboo and places it on Gilligan's head.  It looks just like the ne on the chopped off head.  SKIPPER There you are.  King!!  The skipper then heads off camera to go check on the Howells.  PROFESSOR Now Gilligan...very briefly, the Kupaki words for free the prisoners are...pulu see bagumba.  GILLIGAN Pulu See Bagumba.  PROFESSOR That's right.  Now hit the words hard and make them sound like you're mad!  GILLIGAN Bugilu Gumbamba!!  PROFESSOR No no!  Pulu  See  Bagumba.  Now try it again.  GILLIGAN Pulu Ba sigumba  PROFESSOR Oh Gilligan!  Concentrate!  The Howells are in serious trouble!  Now try it again!  FLIP TO: EXT - TOTEM CLEARING - DAY  The Howells are still tied up, but things are getting rather tense.  The natives are standing around the Howells with their machetes ready to start hacking away.  NATIVE LEADER Dat ta tu moni.  Unga bunga kupa!  MRS HOWELL Thurston, what did he say?  MR HOWELL We...well I don't know, but it sounded like Kupaki for...Cheerio old chap!  NATIVE Mashuka!  Umba!!  The natives are just raising their machetes to strike. The Howells see it coming and start yelling for help.  MR HOWELL and MRS HOWELL Help!!!  NATIVE Ba Kupa!!  Just at this point, the skipper comes running on camera to stop the slaughter.  SKIPPER Wait!!  MRS HOWELL Skipper!  MR HOWELL Skipper!  The natives take the skipper prisoner.  SKIPPER Now look I'm gonna be real fair about this thing! I'm gonna give you boys a chance to get off the island! There's six hundred marines waiting to attack if I'm not back in five minutes!  MRS HOWELL Thurston, isn't that marvelous!? Six hundred Marines!  Oh dear and look, we're not properly dressed to greet them!  MR HOWELL Lovey this is just a bluff!  MRS HOWELL Thurston don't be ridiculous.  Marines never bluff!  SKIPPER Believe me, if you guys know what's good for ya, ya better get off the island right now!  One of the natives puts a machete to the skipper's throat.  SKIPPER You've only got about two minutes left and then you'll be finished!  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY   Gilligan is still trying to learn his lines while Mary Ann, Ginger and the professor look on.  GILLIGAN No Kupa, Pulu See Bagumba.  PROFESSOR Perfect!  Gilligan that's perfect!  GILLIGAN Good...I wonder what I said?  GINGER You know I'm getting worried, the skipper hasn't come back yet.  MARY ANN Well I think we'd better go!  Mr. and Mrs. Howell are probably scared to death by now!  GILLIGAN Yeah I want to see myself in a mirror!  PROFESSOR Oh Gilligan, we don't have time for that!  Gilligan walks off camera and enters his hut to see himself in the mirror.  PROFESSOR Well hurry up!!  CUT TO: INT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan enters the hut and walks over the mirror hanging on the wall.  He admires himself as we...  MARY ANN (O.S.) Gilligan!  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Mary Ann, Ginger and the professor are getting impatient waiting for Gilligan to admire himself. Natives can be seen creeping up behind the three, making ready to take them prisoners.  MARY ANN Gilligan, come on!!  The three are then taken prisoner and walked off down a path into the jungle as we...  CUT TO: EXT - HUT - DAY  Gilligan is seen walking out of the hut looking for the others.  GILLIGAN Professor! Ginger! Mary Ann!  I wonder where they went?  They left without me!  Gilligan takes off to find the others as we...  FLIP TO: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  As we left them, the Howells are still tied to a pole as are Mary Ann and Ginger.  The skipper and the professor are sitting down with their backs against the totem pole and firmly tied in place.  NATIVE Sakupa! Bakuha!  CLOSE UP SHOT: SKIPPER AND PROFESSOR  The following lines are all spoken in a hushed tone.  SKIPPER Where's Gilligan?  PROFESSOR I don't know!  Gillian crawls out from behind some bushes and can not be seen by the natives.  GILLIGAN Hi!  What are you doing there?  SKIPPER I'm sorry we couldn't wait for you Gilligan, but we got all tied up!  GILLIGAN What do I do now? I only rehearsed for the Howells!  PROFESSOR Well make your appearance exactly as we planned Gilligan, only tell them to release ALL of us!  GILLIGAN Well how do I say that?  The skipper has been working at getting loose.  SKIPPER Professor, I think these vines are coming loose!  PROFESSOR But we can't wait till we get loose! Gilligan they may kill us at any moment!  The skipper is making a real effort at getting loose and is shaking the totem pole in the process.  It shakes so hard that the head on top of the totem pole falls and lands in Gilligan's hands.  PROFESSOR Good heavens!  If they notice that head missing they'll come over to investigate!  GILLIGAN I'll...I'll...put...I'll put it back up!  SKIPPER Well hurry it up Gilligan or there'll be a lot of heads missing!  Gilligan takes the head and starts to climb up the totem pole to replace the fallen head.  He uses the skipper's shoulders as a step, but has great difficulty in maintaining his balance.  He tries to put the head back in place but it falls behind the totem pole and out of sight.  The natives notice the commotion and start to look at the totem pole.  Gilligan freezes in place and tries to make the native think that his head is the one at the top.  The natives notice that something is wrong.  NATIVE Mashuka!  The natives, believing their dead king is becoming active, kneel on the ground and start to bow repeatedly.  NATIVES Simba Mashuka.  Simba Mashuka.  Gilligan finally loses his balance and falls away from the totem pole and right in front of the prostrated natives.  One of the natives notices and alerts the others.  NATIVE Bula hula!  The natives, now stand face to face the Mashuka, their once dead king.  NATIVE Mashuka?  GILLIGAN Mashuka?  That's me?  PROFESSOR (WHIPERS) Gilligan!  The professor jerks his head in the direction of the natives, giving Gilligan the go ahead to speak Kupaki.  GILLIGAN Me Mashuka!  Pulu see...  Pulu see...  The professor feeds Gilligan the rest of his lines.  PROFESSOR Pulu see bagumba.  Gilligan then bursts out...  GILLIGAN Pulu see bagumba!!  Hey that was pretty good!  NATIVE LEADER If you dead king...Why you not speak real Kupaki?  GILLIGAN I've been dead so long...I forgot?  The natives don't look too convinced and start to approach Gilligan with machetes raised.  GILLIGAN Would you bel...  Gilligan, thinking he's going to be killed, tries to run away and ends up tripping in the process.  He lands behind the totem pole and hits the chopped off head lying behind it.  The head goes shooting out from behind the totem pole where it lands in full view of the natives.  NATIVE Mashuka!!  We killed burda Mashuka!!  The natives, thinking they killed the once dead king, take off completely terrified and run down a path and off camera.  SKIPPER You did it little buddy!  You did it! You did it!!  GILLIGAN Like they say skipper...two heads are better than one!  SKIPPER Yeah!  Gilligan is satisfied with himself as we...   FADE OUT:     EPILOG  FADE IN: EXT - TOTEM POLE CLEARING - DAY  Gilligan is leading the skipper, Professor and Mr. Howell along the path leading to the totem pole.  The totem pole has been covered with a tarp.  SKIPPER You didn't bring us out here to show us THAT did ya!?  PROFESSOR Oh Gilligan not again!  MR HOWELL When are you gonna stop worrying about looking like some chap on a totem pole?  GILLIGAN Right now Mr. Howell!  Gilligan quickly removes the tarp to reveal that the carved head on top, now looks exactly like Mr. Howells.  GILLIGAN Next time the Kupaki show up...you can be their chief!  MR HOWELL Amazing likeness! Early Rodin!  Oh to be immortalized in your own time.  We close with a final shot of the likeness of Mr. Howell perched on top of the totem pole as we...

We better pick up some bananas huh?  GILLIGAN Ok.  SKIPPER Ok.  Gilligan starts to walk away, still with the earpiece stuck in his ear. The skipper is still holding the jack end and the earpiece gets yanked out with a POP.  SKIPPER Oh Gilligan! Move! Lets get some bananas!  PAN LEFT WITH GILLIGAN AND SKIPPER  The skipper follows Gilligan to look for bananas.  CUT TO: LOW CLOSE UP OF PAILS  We see that one of the pails has the word "GLUE" written on its side.

Gilligan turns on the radio, and searches for a station with marching music. Marching music finally heard on the radio and Gilligan gets a big smile. Gilligan looks pleased with himself and starts marches off camera leaving the skipper to lug both bunches of bananas. The skipper is not at all happy as he starts off after Gilligan.  SKIPPER So have I…  FADE TO: EXT – HUT CLEARING – DAY  WIDE SHOT  We see the skipper and Gilligan walking out of the jungle from around the side of their hut and into the clearing. Gilligan is still marching in front of the skipper as the music plays. The skipper, still carrying both bunches of bananas, is looking very exhausted as he follows Gilligan into the clearing. Both walk towards the camera and stop for a close up.  SKIPPER (STRAINED) Boy can these ba…bananas get heavy!  GILLIGAN Maybe we should have peeled the first.  SKIPPER Yes well ah…oh Gilligan!  GILLIGAN No they'd be too slippery!  SKIPPER Oh…ep…will you forget the bananas and see if the girls brought the fish up from the lagoon?  GILLIGAN Yeah.  Gilligan walks off camera just as the professor walks on camera. The professor is reading a book and not paying too much attention to the skipper.  PROFESSOR Hey skipper.  SKIPPER (EXHAUSTED) Hey professor.  PROFESSOR Got problems?  SKIPPER Ep…problems? No I've haven't got any problems, just, er…I did some fishing down at the lagoon an…and I had two pails of fish and somebody brought 'em up here. Ah…ep, maybe it was you. Did you bring 'em up?   PROFESSOR No it wasn't I. Did you ask the Howells?  SKIPPER No, but I'll go over and ask 'em right now.  PROFESSOR Or perhaps it was Gilligan.

GILLIGAN They put a man on a deserted island all alone.  MARY ANN I know a monkey!  GILLIGAN No a real man.  MARY ANN No I mean maybe a monkey carried the pails of fish away.  GINGER Oh what will the contestant win!?  GILLIGAN Ten thousand dollars if he can stay there a week.  MARY ANN Maybe it was a seal.  GILLIGAN No, seals don't like money they like fish.  GINGER Oh tell us about the man.  GILLIGAN Well, if he gets any help, he looses the pails.  MARY ANN Gilligan I think you're a little confused.  GILLIGAN No I'm not. If the man can stay on a deserted fish for a week, he gets ten thousand pails!   MARY ANN Deserted fish!?  GINGER Ten thousand pails!?  GILLIGAN That doesn't sound quite right does it?  MARY ANN No, now why don't you start all over and tell us about the fish.  GINGER Tell us about the radio program.  Gilligan answers both girls' questions at the same time. He looks back and forth between the two as he does.  GILLIGAN Ok. The fish disappeared, they dropped him on an island, when we went for the bananas, he gets ten thousand dollars, we don't know who did it, and if he gets any help he looses.(pause) I think.

I told you that Vampires are nothing but fairy tales.  SKIPPER But then why'd he try to bite Mrs. Howell  on the neck!?  CUT TO: NEW ANGLE FAVORING PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Well the explanation is obvious. Gilligan was so worried about becoming a Vampire that he became obsessed with the idea.

I mean there's telling who's going to be his next victim!  CUT TO: SHOT FAVORING PROFESSOR  PROFESSOR Fortunately, I know a simple cure for this problem. I'll prepare an anti Vampire potion.

MR HOWELL That's poppycock, you just over wrought from the journey isn't that right teddy dear?  MRS HOWELL Well I can't help it darling. After all there's a rumor that there are Vampires in the neighborhood. And I despise Vampires. They're so toothy.  As Mr. Howell speaks, a wall behind them rotates to reveal the Vampire.  MR HOWELL No I think your imagination is running amok. Any five-year-old child can tell you, there is no such thing as a Vampire. There's no such thing.  The Vampire has come up behind the Howells.  MRS HOWELL There's a Vampire.  MR HOWELL That's the last time I listen to a five- year-old child.  VAMPIRE Gooodeevning! You're my type of folks. You're type A, you're type O.

They stop by the Vampire and tap him on the shoulder and question him.  SHERLOCK I say old boy, have you seen a Vampire?  The Vampire stops feeding and pops up to answer the question.  VAMPIRE Not lately. Why don't you put an ad in the newspapers.  WHATNEY Ahhhh good thinking!  Sherlock and Whatney turn to leave as the Vampire goes back to feeding, prompting Mrs. Howell screams.

Whatney then grabs the Vampire from behind and holds him.  WHATNEY Use your head inspector!  Inspector Sherlock, bends over and drives his head into the vampire's mid drift, sending him sprawling with a "BUH-RooooooM!" overlay.

That finally wakes Gilligan out of his dream and he realizes whom he just hit.  GILLIGAN Skipper? Is that you!?  SKIPPER No, it's not the skipper. I'm Frankenstein's monster!

PROFESSOR Now try to remember to give the orders exactly the way you gave on the Minnow! And Gilligan, the only thing you can do to help is to listen and obey!

Episode #75, "Man With A Net" (Lord Beasley, famous butterfly catcher, lands on the island.)   GILLIGAN'S ISLAND  "Man With A Net"  by  Budd Grossman  October 24, 1966  TEASER  FADE IN  EXT - LAGOON - EARLY MORNING - WIDE SHOT - CREDIT OVERLAY  PAN RIGHT/ZOOM:  Gilligan is seen sleeping with a fishing pole as he lays up against a piece of drift wood near the Lagoon. On his hat can be seen a butterfly.  PAN RIGHT:  We see a man wearing safari style clothing walk on camera, wearing a pith helmet and is carrying what looks like a net as he skulks through the jungle. He has a pair of binoculars around his neck and he's looking around for something. He looks over to see a butterfly sitting on Gilligan's hat just a few feet away.  He creeps his way towards Gilligan with his net in hand.  When he gets close enough, he makes a fast swoop with the net. Just as the net is closing in on the butterfly it takes off and escapes. The only thing his net catches is Gilligan's entire head.  LORD BEASLEY Oh dear I do believe I missed him!  GILLIGAN Hey what's going on!?  The man oblivious that he's just caught Gilligan in his net proceeds to look through his binoculars and starts to walk off, still with Gilligan's head in the net.  LORD BEASELY He couldn't have gone very far.  Gilligan is forced to follow or be choked by the net.  GILLIGAN Hey mister! Hey mister!  Gilligan has no choice but to dragged along after the man as we...  FADE OUT   ACT ONE FADE IN  EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY -  Gilligan is seen running into the clearing near the Hut.  The skipper is working on attaching some legs to a new table he's building.  GILLIGAN Hey Skipper!  Gilligan startles the skipper who in turn completely ruins the table.  SKIPPPER What is it Gilligan!  GILLIGAN There's a man on the Island with a net trying to catch a butterfly!  SKIPPER If there is a man with a net on this Island he'd be after you!  GILLIGAN No skipper really I was minding my own business fishing...  PAN LEFT:  Just then a man with a net walks on camera as the Skipper and Gilligan are arguing. He is searching for the butterfly that got away. He thinks he's on the butterflies trail.  LORD BEASLEY Wait for me! Wait for me little butterfly!  The man walks completely past the skipper and Gilligan without noticing them. He is looking through his binoculars as he walks into a table almost knocking it over. He continues to walk off camera.  SKIPPER Gilligan you're right!  The skipper takes off after the man.  GILLIGAN I told you I told you!  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  The skipper and Gilligan are following after the man and approach him as he continues to look for his butterfly. He is crawling on the ground as he peers through his binoculars into the jungle. The skipper and Gilligan are right behind him.  SKIPPER Excuse me sir!  The man looks up and inspects the skipper.  LORD BEASLEY Your no butterfly!  He crawls away as he goes back to hunting for his butterfly.  SKIPPER Are you looking for something?  LORD BEASLEY Shhhhhh! of course I'm looking for something! I'm looking for the Cetridney Lexipus.  GILLIGAN Ceti wha...wha...whatamus?  LORD BEASLEY Cetridney Lexipus Otherwise known as the Pussycat Swallowtail.  SKIPPER Wha...did you loose it?  LORD BEASLEY Of course I didn't loose it! My dear man the Pussycat Swallowtail is the rarest butterfly in the entire world! It's the only butterfly that escaped Lord Beasley.  Lord Beasley, Gilligan and the skipper are still on their hands and knees searching for butterflies. Lord Beasley see a blue butterfly on a rock and using his net catches it. He picks it up and examines it.  LORD BEASLEY I'm Lord Beasley and that's not a Pussycat Swallowtail.  He tosses the butterfly aside and continues his hunt.  SKIPPER Wa...wa...but Lord Beasley how did you get here on the island?  LORD BEASLEY By boat. Some of the natives said that that butterfly had been seen on this island.  GILLIGAN How you gonna get off the island?  Lord Beasley appears to have spotted something up ahead.  LORD BEASLEY (WHISPERING) Shhhhhhh...By boat. By Jove that might be one over there.  Lord Beasley crawls away to investigate.  SKIPPER Lord Beasley when we...come on Gilligan.  The skipper realizes Lord Beasley isn't listening to him, he and Gilligan follow after Lord Beasley. Lord Beasley spots a yellow butterfly sitting on a rotten log.  LORD BEASLEY That's it! That's it!  SKIPPER Lord Beasley!  LORD BEASLEY Shhhhhh!  SKIPPER when you leave...  LORD BEASLEY Shhhhhh!  SKIPPER (WHISPERING) When you leave the island can we go with you?  LORD BEASLEY (QUIET ANGER) Yes yes now do be QUIET!  The skipper turns to Gilligan who is slightly behind the skipper.  SKIPPER (HUSHED EXCITMENT) Did you hear that Gilligan!? We can leave the island!  GILLIGAN WHOOOPEEEEE!!  Just as Lord Beasley was attempting to catch the Pussycat Swallow tail, Gilligan's yelp of elation scared the butterfly which takes off. Lord Beasley is once again with out his butterfly.  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  The skipper is explaining to the professor the circumstances of Lord Beasley's presence on the island.  SKIPPER ...as soon as he catches one of those silly butterflies, he's gonna shoot off his flare gun.  GILLIGAN And a boats gonna take us off the island!  The professor doesn't look to confident as he listens to the skipper and Gilligan.  PROFESSOR Gentlemen, we have a problem.  SKIPPER What kind of a problem? You mean there's not going to be enough space on the boat?  GILLIGAN How much room can one butterfly take up!?  PROFESSOR Well the problem is catching the butterfly. Now I know that Lord Beasley is a world famous authority but according to this book it's not at all unusual for a butterfly collector to take weeks, months even years to collect the proper specimen. Even if they know its habitat!  GILLIGAN I didn't know a butterfly had a habitat! I thought they had wings and those...those skinny things that came out of their heads.  SKIPPER Gilligan, quiet! What do you suggest?  PROFESSOR Well no one knows this island as well as we do. So I suggest we make some extra nets and all seven of us take turns helping Lord Beasley collect those butterflies just as soon as possible.  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Mr. And Mrs. Howell are following Lord Beasley through the Jungle on his search for the Pussycat Swallowtail.  MRS HOWELL ...and a great friend of ours is the first Earl of Chelsey. I understand he's terribly wealthy.  MR HOWELL Heh...heh...so wealthy he's got monogrammed contact lenses.  LORD BEASLEY I do believe something's fluttering up ahead!  MR HOWELL Oh yes.  MRS HOWELL You know Lord Beasley, I think we met you at Princes Grace's at a dinner party several years ago. Uh...there was someone at the punch bowl with a Pith helmet.  MR HOWELL Ah no my dear no my dear with a pith helmet that was Sir Charles the famous Elephant hunter.  MRS HOWELL Oh yes of course it was, well anyway who ever it was he was terribly potted!  MR HOWELL Well no wonder, scooping the punch out of the bowl with the helmet!  Lord Beasley has not been paying attention and is looking through binoculars for the butterfly that he sees fluttering up ahead.  LORD BEASLEY It looks like it could be a Pussycat Swallow tail!  Mr. Howell realizes that Lord Beasley was not paying attention and is in a world by himself.  MR HOWELL No...it's no use my dear, Lord Beasley has a one butterfly mind.  CUT TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Lord Beasley is still hunting for his elusive butterfly as Mr. And Mrs. Howell follow along at a distance trying to help. Lord Beasley has spotted an orange butterfly and is moving in for the catch.  LORD BEASLEY That's right little pussycat, just sit there quietly until I...  He leaps out and takes a swing with the net.  LORD BEASLEY Oh rot I missed him!  Lord Beasley leapt into something that is now making him sink. Mrs. Howell lets out a yell as she sees Lord Beasley slowing sinking in quick sand.  MR HOWELL Good heavens!  MRS HOWELL It's quicksand!  MR HOWELL A...don't panic Lord Beasley! We'll save you!  Lord Beasley is slowly sinking in the quicksand as he continues to watch the butterfly fly away.  LORD BEASLEY Never mind me, after that butterfly!!  Lord Beasley continues to sink lower and lower.  MRS HOWELL Lord Beasley your sinking!!  LORD BEASLEY He's heading North by North-east! Or is it North by North-west? No it's North by North- east alright! After him! After him!  Mr. And Mrs. Howell continue to try and rescue Lord Beasley using their butterfly nets as we...  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - DAY  Lord Beasley, Ginger and Mary Ann are walking through the jungle near the cliff area still searching for the Pussycat Swallowtail.  LORD BEASLEY Shhhhhhh, remember your training Beasley old man.  Move as stealthily as a snake, as gracefully as a fawn, as quietly as a Rolls Royce.  Ginger stops to look at her finger nails and doesn't appear overly interested in finding the butterfly.  MARY ANN Ginger! We're suppose to be helping to catch a butterfly!  GINGER Mary Ann the only thing I know how to catch is a man!  CUT TO: SAME AREA - CLOSE SHOT - BEASLEY  Lord Beasley has seen something up ahead and is getting excited. He's looking through his binoculars as he walks and is unaware that the cliff is near.  LORD BEASLEY Is it or isn't it? Could be. Yes I do believe it is! A Pussycat Swallowtail!  Ginger and Mary Ann see that Lord Beasley is getting dangerously close to the cliff.  MARY ANN Lord Beasley look out for the...  Lord Beasley has gone over the edge of the cliff. Ginger and Mary Ann can't bare to look.  MARY ANN ...cliff! Oh I can't look!  GINGER Me neither!  With that said, Ginger and Mary Ann exchange glances and decide to look over the cliff anyway.  CUT TO: EXT - CLIFF - DAY  We see Lord Beasley hanging from a small tree that has grown out of the side of the cliff.  He's still intent on catching the butterfly.  LORD BEASLEY (POINTING) Hurry! Hurry! He went that way!!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING -DAY  All the castaways are sitting around with their feet in a variety of containers as they soak their feet in water and looking particularly exhausted.  SKIPPER How are your feet Gilligan?  GILLIGAN I don't know skipper. My feet and I aren't on speaking terms.  PROFESSOR Well we've been over almost every inch of this island and we're not even sure that Lord Beasley has even seen a Pussycat Swallowtail yet!  MR HOWELL Where else can he find to look!?  Just then Lord Beasley walks on camera wearing a complete wet suit, flipper, mask and air tank. He continues to walk until he's off camera.  MR HOWELL Good Heavens!  GINGER He's looking for a butterfly under the water?  MR HOWELL That's what I call a determined man!  SKIPPER That's what I call a determined nut!  MRS HOWELL There must be some way to make that man forget his silly butterfly and get us off this island now!  PROFESSOR Well the questions is how? Until he catches that butterfly he positively refuses to shoot off that flare gun so the boat can pick him up.  MARY ANN Well maybe he'll give up when re realizes there's no place on this island he hasn't looked.  GILLIGAN Except for the top of that mountain over there.  Out of no where, Lord Beasley appears.  LORD BEASLEY What mountain?  FLIP TO: EXT - MOUNTAIN SIDE - DAY  Lord Beasley, followed by the skipper and Gilligan are seen climbing up the steep side of the mountain Gilligan pointed out. A rope connects all three climbers as they make their trek up the side.  SKIPPER You and your big mouth!  Just then several small rocks tumble past the two. The skipper is having difficulty avoiding them. Lord Beasley hears the skipper and is getting agitated.  LORD BEASLEY Shhhhhhh!  Something with wings is flying up around up ahead!  GILLLIGAN We're so high up it's probably an angel!  FADE TO: INT - HOWELL'S HUT - NIGHT  Mr. And Mrs. Howell are in their hut and Mr. Howell is pacing looking quite upset.  MR HOWELL Lovey I tell you I'm so frustrated that...that I could almost scream!  MRS HOWELL Awe I know how you feel dear. Our rescue seems so near, and yet so far.  MR HOWELL There must be some way of influencing Lord Beasley to fire that flare gun now!  MRS HOWELL Well you know darling, there's only one honest way to influence anybody!  MR HOWELL (EXCITEDLY) Your right! Ha...ha...ha...ha...Bribery!  FLIP TO: INT - SUPPLY HUT - EVENING  Lord Beasley is seen sitting in front of a handmade map of the island while he ponders his next location for search. Mr. Howell enters the hut with plans of bribery on his mind.  LORD BEASLEY Lets see, yesterday we looked here and here.  Lord Beasley sticks pins in the map indicating locations already searched. He is oblivious to Mr. Howells entry.  MR HOWELL A...good evening Lord Beasley may I come in?  Lord Beasley does not acknowledge Howells presence.  LORD BEASLEY And the day before we looked here.  He adds another pin.  MR HOWELL Oh thank you very much. May I say that you look like a million dollars! Would you like to try for two million?  Lord Beasley is self absorbed and never responds to Mr. Howell.  LORD BEASLEY And we've also looked here.  MR HOWELL Lord Beasley I'm a very wealthy man and to get me off this island I'd happily pay you one hundred thousand dollars.  No response from Lord Beasley.  LORD BEASLEY Now we've looked by the cove.  MR HOWELL Happily two hundred thousand dollars.  Again no response.  LORD BEASLEY Also yes yes by the bat cave.  MR HOWELL Unhappily three hundred thousand dollars.  You guessed it, no response from Lord Beasley.  LORD BEASLEY I believe I looked there, yes I did!  MR HOWELL Lord Beasley will you at least give me the courtesy of listening when I'm trying to bribe you!  LORD BEASLEY Now the question is, where shall I look again.  Lord Beasley finally knows where to look.  LORD BEASLEY Aaaaah!  MR HOWELL Please listen to me!  Mr. Howell is upset at Lord Beasley and decides to stand between the map and Lord Beasley in order to get his attention.  LORD BEASLEY The center of he island!  At that, Lord Beasley tries to stick a pin in the map, but stick Mr. Howell instead where by Lord Beasley walks out of the hut.  MR HOWELL Heavens I've had an appendectomy!  FLIP TO: INT - SUPPLY HUT - DAY  Lord Beasley is sitting near his map looking at the search areas again as he talks to himself.  LORD BEASLEY Well, that sortie was a disappointment.  Ginger, comes into the hut with intentions of scamping Lord Beasley into firing the flare gun. She's brought with her a bunch of flowers.  GINGER Lord Beasley, may I come in?  As with Mr. Howell, Lord Beasley pays no attention to her.  LORD BEASLEY What now, the mountain top again?  Ginger leans up against some crates near the door as she tries to be sexy.  GINGER Lord Beasley?  She gets even closer.  GINGER Lord Beasley, you know I've always been crazy about lords and ladies. Especially lords.  Ginger is now standing behind Lord Beasley acting alluring but Lord Beasley still doesn't acknowledge Ginger's presence as he gazes at his map.  LORD BEASLEY On second thought I think I'll save the mountain top for tomorrow.  GINGER I hope you don't think I'm being too forward, but...  Just then Ginger sees a bee buzzing around the hut. It must have come from the flowers she brought.  GINGER A bee!   Shoooo    Shoooo!   Shoooo!!  Lord Beasley is just as unaware of the bee as he is of Ginger.  LORD BEASLEY Of course I could always try the east end of the island again.  GINGER Don't you worry about a thing, I'll take care of it for you.  Ginger is now trying to get rid of the pesty bee.   GINGER Shoooo   Shooooo!  Shoooo!! Shooooo!!! Ooooowwwwww!!!!!  Ooooo!  Ginger gets stung by the bee as she makes her way out of the hut. Lord Beasley until now has been unaware of anything going on around him.  LORD BEASLEY Hello? Did someone say something?  Lord Beasley looks around only to find himself alone.  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT  The professor can be seen alone with a book about butterflies as he studies up on the subject.  PROFESSOR The Cetridney butterfly, identified by the bright yellow spots on it's blue wings. The Ninfaliday, builds itself a shelter out of rolled leaves. Also known as the Milkweed butterfly. No no no that's the Pathelyoniday!  Mary Ann walks into the clearing as she hears the professor studying.  MARY ANN Professor! Lord Beasley has you talking to yourself!  PROFESSOR Oh please Mary Ann I am trying to memorize these facts about butterflies so I can converse with Lord Beasley in an intellectual fashion. I must convince him to fire that flare gun so we can get rescued. Now...the Infalice-Antiopius also known as the Redtailed...noooooo that's the Basilarcia!  MARY ANN Oh professor uh when I was in school, some of the kids, well not me of course but, used to put crib notes in the palms of there hands, just to help them remember things.  PROFESSOR Mary Ann remember to whom you are speaking! I mean after all the idea, a professor with six degrees using crib notes!  MARY ANN I'm sorry. It was just and idea.  Mary Ann walks off camera feeling badly. Meanwhile the professor has a curious look on his face.  PROFESSOR And an excellent idea at that!  FLIP TO: EXT - JUNGLE - NIGHT  Lord Beasley and the professor are crawling along the ground searching through the jungle, still looking for the Pussycat Swallowtail. Lord Beasley has a miners helmet and lamp on his head to see with. He stops and picks up an caterpillar.  LORD BEASLEY My word, obviously this caterpillar will never turn into a Cetridney Lexipus.  PROFESSOR Oh obviously not, why that's a...  The professor inspects the palm of his hand.  PROFESSOR Basalarcia Artimus if I ever saw one.  Lord Beasley tosses the caterpillar aside, looks suspicious and moves on. He then inspects some leaves of a plant.  LORD BEASLEY Ahhhh butterfly eggs!  PROFESSOR Yes and from the looks of them, I'd say they were from the family of uh...(Checks palm)...Infalia Artimus.  Lord Beasley again looks suspicious.  LORD BEASLEY Possibly possibly.  PROFESSOR Lord Beasley I haven't told you this before but I...I'm a great admirer of yours. Why I practically memorized your book the butterfly and I!  LORD BEASLEY Indeed!?  I'm writing a sequel, things with wings!  PROFESSOR Ahhhhh splendid title splendid title! Now that I met you in person I can't wait until we get off this island so that we can...  Lord Beasley finds yet another discovery.  LORD BEASLEY Ah ha! What have we here. A bright red butterfly with spots of brown. What would you say he is professor?  The professor consults his palm as he searches for the answer.  PROFESSOR Ah bright red with spots of brown. That's from the family of Lyciniday, also known as the meadow brown.  Before the professor can finish, Lord Beasley turns and takes a look at the professor palm and discovers his notes.  LORD BEASLEY Just as I suspected. If there's one thing detest professor, it's an imposterous butterfly collector!  Lord Beasley being upset, crawls off and leaves the professor alone in the jungle.  PROFESSOR Imposterous.  Imposterous?  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - NIGHT  The castaways are sitting around the table pondering what to do next.  PROFESSOR It's no use.  All our efforts to get Lord Beasley to fire off that flare gun have failed absolutely miserably!  MR HOWELL He wouldn't even listen to a bribe. The man is obviously a mental case.  MRS HOWELL There must be something we can do to get him to fire that flare!  GILLIGAN Well why don't we just, you know...  SKIPPER Gilligan quiet please! The question is what can we DO!  MARY ANN Oh you can't even get his attention unless you look like a butterfly.  GILLIGAN Well why don't we...  SKIPPER Gilligan quiet please!  GINGER Maybe we could hypnotize him, and make him think that we're all Pussycat Swallowtails!  GILLIGAN Why don't we...  SKIPPER Gilligan please!  GILLIGAN Why don't we just fire the flare gun!?  SKIPPER Gilligan I'm going to tell you for the last time will you be quie...flare gun, fla...what flare gun!?  GILLIGAN This flare gun!  Gilligan hold up the flare gun for all to see.  SKIPPER Gilligan!! Where did you get THAT!  GILLIGAN It was on the table an when he went out he just left it and I picked it up.  MR HOWELL Well just don't stand there man, fire it, fire it!!  Gilligan hold up the flare gun and pulls the trigger.  GILLLIGAN It must have a silencer I didn't hear a thing.  SKIPPER You knuckle head why didn't it go off!?  MR HOWELL Yes I wonder why it didn't.  From off camera Lord Beasley is heard.  LORD BEASLEY Because I have the flares. So, you thought you could flatter and cajole and trick me into breaking my vow not to leave this island without the Pussycat Swallowtail! Shame on you! And after our two countries had built up a friendship based on mutual trust, despite of what happen in seventeen seventy-six! Now hear this!  We shall stay on this island until we catch the that butterfly, if it takes forever!  Goodnight!  With that said, Lord Beasley goes into his hut and closes the door. The rest of the castaways are left with a look of disappointment on their faces as we...  FADE OUT    ACT TWO FADE IN:  EXT - CLEARING - DAY  The castaways are lined up in a row each holding a make shift butterfly net as Lord Beasley begins his inspection.  LORD BEASLEY Troops tenSION! Present nets!  The castaways following orders, raise their nets to their shoulders. Lord Beasley walks along, inspecting his troops.  LORD BEASLEY Mr. Howell your net is very untidy! Remove the loose grass!  MR HOWELL No look here! I...  PROFESSOR (QUIETLY) Mr. Howell he's our only hope of getting off the island.  MR HOWELL Oh  LORD BEASLEY Did you have something you wanted to say?  MR HOWELL Ah...no mone Capiton!  LORD BEASLEY Now before we go into the field today, may I remind you, that unless we catch that butterfly, nobody leaves the island!  SKIPPER He's a regular Captain Bligh!  LORD BEASLEY No talking in the ranks!  SKIPPER Yes sir!  LORD BEASLEY And may I remind you, that captain Bligh was also a Britisher!  SKIPPER Yes sir!  LORD BEASLEY Troops tenSION!  The castaways straighten up and come to attention.  LORD BEASLEY Left face!  The castaways do as they're told.  LORD BEASLEY Shoulder nets!  As the castaways put their nets on the shoulders, each of their nets catches the castaways head in back of them.  LORD BEASLEY Forward March!  Just as they begin marching, Lord Beasley reverses direction.  LORD BEASLEY To the rear march!  They all pivot around and start to march off in to the jungle.  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - DAY  The castaways are being marched back to camp after a long days search for the elusive butterfly.  LORD BEASLEY Hup two three four hup two three four troop halt!  It's now precisely seventeen hundred hours. We shall rest for half an hour, and then resume our search at precisely seventeen hundred and thirty hours.  Troops fall out.  Lord Beasley walks off and stands nearby , as the castaways take a seat at the table to rest. Gilligan doesn't sit with the others as he takes his rest on a lounge chair some distance away.  GILLIGAN Oh my poor feet!  SKIPPER Oh your poor feet!? My calluses have calluses!  PROFESSOR Oh that's nothing, would you believe my socks are melting!?  MARY ANN Oh I'm a half an inch shorter, I've worn out my feet!  GINGER I'm a half an inch taller! I'm standing on my blisters!  MRS HOWELL Thurston how much longer will we have to be in this horrible army!  MR HOWELL Oh when we get home the British embassy will hear about it believe me!  LORD BEASLEY Cheer up men, with continued fortitude and resolution, it is only a question of time before...  MR HOWELL Before we collapse from heat prostration!  CUT TO: CLOSE SHOT - GILLIGAN  We see Gilligan laying on the lounge chair as a reddish butterfly floats around him and lands on his chest.  CUT TO: PREVIOUS SHOT  Lord Beasley looks over at Gilligan and sees the butterfly.  LORD BEASLEY That's it! That's the Pussycat Swallow tail! After him!  Lord Beasley and the others take off in Gilligan's direction.  CUT TO: CLOSE SHOT - GILLIGAN  Gilligan sees the horde coming at him and shoos the butterfly away as he thinks they're after him. He franticly gets up and starts to run. The others pass by him as they chase the butterfly.  GILLIGAN What'd I do!?  FADE TO: INT - SKIPPER'S HUT - NIGHT  We see the skipper sitting at a table with paint brush in hand.  He's holding a small bamboo cage that contains a colorful butterfly. He's using the paint brush to add colors to the butterfly. Gilligan looks on holding a painters palette as the skipper does his work.  GILLIGAN Skipper? A little purple would be pretty.  SKIPPER Gilligan we're trying to make this butterfly look exactly like the Pussycat Swallowtail in the professor's book! And there is no purple in it!  GILLIGAN Well a little purple would be pretty skipper.  SKIPPER Would you please just hold the palette steady! Or I'll make you purple! And black and blue too!  The professor enters the hut.  PROFESSOR Hey have either of you fellas seen my book on the...  The professor sees what the skipper is doing.  PROFESSOR What are you doing!? Why your painting a butterfly!  GILLIGAN I think the little devil likes it.  SKIPPER It's going to help us get off the island!  PROFESSOR I don't believe it. I don't believe it!  The skipper has just finishing his creation and appears proud of his work.  SKIPPER There you are now Gilligan, call Lord Beasley!  PROFESSOR It won't work! An authority like Lord Beasley will never in a million years be taken in by a painted butterfly.  SKIPPER & GILLIGAN Call Lord Beasley.  Gilligan turns and goes to the window to call Lord Beasley to the hut.  GILLIGAN Lord Beasley! Lord Beasley! We cauth'em!...we caught'em!...we caught'em!...we caught'em!  Immediately Lord Beasley rushes into the hut.  LORD BEASLEY Where! Where! Where! Where!  Lord Beasley sees the butterfly in the cage the skipper is holding.  LORD BEASLEY Ah the Cetridney Lexipus if I ever say one!!  SKIPPER It is!? Well good now we can shoot off the flare gun and we'll all be rescued!  LORD BEASLEY In a moment in a moment! I'd like to examine this beauty more closely.  Lord Beasley star leaves the hut, just as a thunder storm arrives with thunder, lighting and rain.  PROFESSOR Well, now I've seen everything!  GILLIGAN We sure are good painters huh skipper?  SKIPPER I want to tell ya, who is this Picasso and Rembrandt? Gentleman Aloha, Hawaii here we...come?  Just then Lord Beasley returns to the hut. He's now carrying the bamboo cage with a white butterfly and is not too pleased.  LORD BEASLEY The rain seems to have turned your butterfly into a large white moth! (pause) Well!!  INSERT: CLOSEUP OF MOTH IN CAGE  SKIPPER Well if there's anything I can't stand it's a butterfly that won't hold it's colors.  GILLIGAN Maybe it turned white because it was sick.  LORD BEASLEY Gentleman consider yourselves fortunate! In England I would have had you jailed for butterfly forgery!  Lord Beasley turns and leaves the hut. Gilligan is running after him.  GILLIGAN Lord Beasley!!  Lord Beasley slams the door closed just as Gilligan gets there and the painters palette he was holding gets pushed right in his face. Gilligan turns around and his face is covered in a multitude of colors.  FADE TO: EXT - CEARING - DAY  We see another of the professor's contraptions. It is a multiple barrel arrangement that is connected to an air pump which is being driven by the bicycle power unit the skipper is on. It is squeaking and making other various sounds.  A bamboo cylinder has a black rubber bag attached is inflating and deflating as the skipper pumps the bike.  PROFESSOR Well gentlemen what do you think?  MR HOWELL Well I must say professor it's a very...heady smelling concoction, a lot of...  PROFESOR Oh yes indeed, after these berries have fermented in the sun, they have a lovely flavor and quite a kick.  SKIPPER Well I don't know, getting Lord Beasley tipsy so we can get him to fire his flare gun, is a pretty wild scheme to me!  PROFESSOR Listen skipper, for a fella who recently tried to paint a butterfly I...  MR HOWELL Well I don't see how it could miss! I once made some fantastic business deals over a few drinks! I will never forget I once sold grand central station over three martinis.  SKIPPER What's so fantastic about that!?  MR HOWELL I didn't own it!  As they are talking the black rubber bag is getting larger and larger. The professor is collecting the fermented berry juice in a gourd.  PROFESSOR Gentlemen I think we're about ready. I think we have enough.  The black rubber bag is incredibly large now and can take no more.  MR HOWELL I predict that after a few sips of that concoction, Lord Beasley's flare gun will go off by itself!  Just then the bag lets loose with a loud bang!  FLIP TO: EXT - HUT CLEARING - EVENING  All the castaways are seated around the table with the gourd, coconut drinking glasses and the radio.  MARY ANN Here's some more tea.  GINGER Oh don't spill any of that tea Mary Ann, it's libel to eat right through the table.  MR HOWELL Now...now remember, act very casual, so Lord Beasley won't get suspicious.  MRS HOWELL And remember also that the proper way to drink tea is with your little pink extended. Thusly.  SKIPPER Thanks a lot Mrs. Howell...Oop her comes Gilligan and lord Beasley now Shhhhh!  We can hear Lord Beasley making Gilligan March with his hup two three four cadence.  LORD BEASLEY Hup two three four hup two three four halt one two!  Gilligan doesn't stop and runs into the back of Lord Beasley.  LORD BEASLEY Halt means stop Gilligan!  GILLIGAN I think my stoppers broke.  MR HOWELL Eh...er oh Lord Beasley before you...please sit down won't you we have a...a little surprise for you.  MRS HOWELL A specialty in your honor Lord Beasley.  LORD BEASLEY Well how nice, we'll just have time before we explore the volcano.  MR HOWELL Oh...oh how jolly.  MRS HOWELL Here you are Lord Beasley!

ALL Lord Beasley, long may his butterfly net wave!  LORD BEASLEY How sporting of you!  MR HOWELL Yes of course.  LORD BEASLEY I always admire a good loser.  GILLIGAN Skipper? This tea tastes just like...  The skipper puts his hand over Gilligan's mouth t shut him up.  SKIPPER (QUIETLY) It IS!  GILLIGAN Oh that's why it tastes like....  Again the skipper covers Gilligan's mouth.  PROFESSOR A toast, to Lord Beasley! Long may his butterflies fly!  ALL Lord Beasley! Long may his butterflies fly!  LORD BEASLEY Drink up! Drink up! When Beasley drinks, everybody drinks!  Mr. Howell pours more "tea" for Lord Beasley.  MR HOWELL There you are!  LORD BEASLEY Delicious! Now you must excuse me, I've gotta get my asbestos suit so we can explore the volcano.  PROFESSOR Another toast! To the United Kingdom!  ALL To the United Kingdom!  FLIP TO: SAME SHOT - LATER  Everyone appears to be very drunk now and Lord Beasley is still standing as everyone else is sitting.  SKIPPER (SLURRED) Oh a just a minute Lord Beasley.

LORD BEASLEY There you are!  MR HOWELL To the...wait!...One more...to the British boy scouts!  LORD BEASLEY The little fellows!  MR HOWELL The little fellows yes.  LORD BEASLEY, MR HOWELL To the British Boy Scouts!  Mr. Howell is the last to pass out, leaving Lord Beasley the only one awake.  LORD BEASLEY And a toast to this most delightful tasting tea!  Lord Beasley looks up from his last toast and sees a butterfly sitting on a rock.  LORD BEASLEY It can't be! But it is!  Lord Beasley, along with his net, creeps up on the butterfly and catches it in his net.  LORD BEASLEY At long last! A Pussycat Swallowtail is mine! There you are my beauty!  Lord Beasley takes the butterfly out of the net and places it in a glass jar. He then reaches for his flare gun, raises it up and fires.  INSERT: STOCK FOOTAGE OF FLARE RISING  Lord Beasley runs back to the table.  LORD BEASLEY Hurry! Hurry everybody! The boat will be hear in fifteen minutes!  Lord Beasley sees everyone asleep at the table and is rather disappointed.  LORD BEASLEY Gilligan! Gilligan!  Lord Beasley tries to wake Gilligan up, but with no luck.  LORD BEASLEY Well my little Pussycat, I'm afraid we shall have to leave without them.  Lord Beasley takes one last look at the sleeping castaways.  LORD BEASLEY That's the trouble with you Americans. You simply don't know how to hold your tea!  We're left looking at the sleeping castaways as we...

GINGER Oh...your next to me Gilligan, where ever I am.  MRS HOWELL Oh dear, this is the last tea from fermented berries I'll ever serve at one of my parties!  MR HOWELL Now I remember.  We were drinking toasts to...  ALL Lord Beasley!  PROFESSOR I don't see him anywhere!  MARY ANN Has anyone thought of looking under the table!?  Gilligan comes running out of the hut.  GILLIGAN Hey all of his things are gone!  MR HOWELL According to my watch, we've been asleep only...only ten minutes!  PROFESSOR Only ten minutes!? Well according to my calendar watch, we've been asleep for two days and ten minutes!  SKIPPER Two DAYS!  PROFESSOR I wonder if there's anything on the radio?  The professor turns on the radio.

By the time he gets back from the Antarctic, he'll forget we ever existed!  GILLIGAN What are we gonna do!?  MR HOWELL Well I don't know about the rest of you, as far as I'm concerned it's...tea time.  Mr. Howell takes another drink of "tea" and almost passes out again as we...    FADE OUT:  END CREDITS

I was supposed to star in this play. Ginger stops crying while listening to Gilligan's story. GILLIGAN I was in a play once in school. It was called "Our Friends in the Forest." I played a squirrel. GINGER Oh, please. GILLIGAN And all I had to do was gather nuts while the other animals did nothing. I gathered nuts and nuts, and by the time winter came, I had plenty to eat, but -- GINGER I know. All the other animals went hungry. GILLIGAN You saw the play. Ginger stands and walks in a small circle. Gilligan stands too. GINGER Oh, Gilligan. You just don't understand. You just don't understand. This play was especially written for me. Why, I would have been famous overnight if I got to do it. All Broadway would have been at my feet. GILLIGAN Gee. GINGER Why, a new star would have been born. My name would have been assured among the greats. Producers would be clamoring for me. GILLIGAN You know what, Ginger? GINGER What? GILLIGAN You ought to be on the stage. Ginger cries again. She walks over to a tree and leans her head against the trunk. GINGER Oh, Gilligan. You don't understand at all. You just don't understand.

MR HOWELL Don't talk to me, you scurvy mutineer! Captain, throw this man in irons! SKIPPER Oh, relax, Mister Howell. This is not a mutiny. He's just reading some lines from a play. MR HOWELL A play? Reading some lines -- Well, there's one thing I can't stand, is a mutiny before luncheon. GILLIGAN Mister Howell, it's a script. Gilligan hands the script to Mr. Howell.

GILLIGAN Sure, Mister Howell. We can try it out here and if it's good, we can take it to Broadway. MR HOWELL Well, I don't know. SKIPPER Why don't you do it, Mister Howell? It'll be a lot of prestige. MR HOWELL I've got prestige. GILLIGAN And if it's a hit, you make a million dollars. MR HOWELL I've got a million dollars.

MARY ANN Oh, that's wonderful! GINGER What's wonderful about it? So what if he puts my play on here? GILLIGAN You don't understand. We'll put it on here first, and if it's real good, he'll take it to Broadway. Meanwhile, the island -- the island's kind of like off-Broadway. GINGER Oh. MARY ANN Oh, that's great! Mister Howell has all kinds of influence. If anyone can make you a star, he can. GINGER Oh, Gilligan, you've made me so... Ginger stands up and walks over to Gilligan, which backs him into a pole. GINGER (cont'd) ... happy. You're wonderful! You're just marvelous. I don't know how to describe you, you're so great. Ginger kisses her finger and moves to press her finger to Gilligan's lips. He turns away and knocks his head into a pole. Gilligan appears dazed as he slides down the pole. Ginger gives an aside glance and shrugs. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Mrs. Howell is seated in front of a typewriter. Mr. Howell paces behind her. MR HOWELL Let's see. Whom can I get to play the leading man in this play? MRS HOWELL Well, what's he like, dear? MR HOWELL Well, the part calls for someone who has a magnificent physique, ravishingly handsome, marvelous diction. I know who would be perfect, but I'll be too busy directing the play. (beat) All right, back to business. Let's finish typing the parts. MRS HOWELL Well, I'm ready, dear. MR HOWELL "Marc Antony brings you news from Rome. The battle goes well, and the armies move onward, ever onward." Have you got that, my dear? MRS HOWELL Em-ay-are ... Mrs. Howell hunts and for the "C" key. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) ... see. Marc. There. What did you say after that, dear? MR HOWELL I see this is going to be a long rewrite. MRS HOWELL I've never typed before, and this typewriter's very confusing. They have the ay-bee-sees all mixed up. Ginger enters. GINGER Mister Howell! Mister Howell! Gilligan told me you're going to produce my play. Oh, you've made me the happiest girl in the world. Ginger kisses Mr. Howell on the cheek which leaves lipstick. Mrs. Howell's mouth is agape in shock over Ginger kissing Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL Come, my dear. Let's not lose our heads. GINGER I just wanted to thank you, Mister Howell. I'll see you at rehearsal, huh? Ginger exits. MR HOWELL Ta-ta, my dear. See you at the theater. Emotional little creature, isn't she? MRS HOWELL Yes. (beat) And if I were you, I'd wipe her gratitude off my face. MR HOWELL Oh, yes, yes, of course. Mr. Howell wipes the lipstick off his cheek with a handkerchief.

I thought there was a ship in the harbor. GINGER Gilligan, I got to change my costume. GILLIGAN Oh. Ginger exits. Gilligan walks over to the nearby stage. Professor paints the scenery. The Professor paints the window on the set with a brush and a coconut cup of paint. GILLIGAN (cont'd) Gee, Professor, you're doing a real neat job. PROFESSOR Thanks, Gilligan. You know, these jungle berries mixed with water make excellent paint. Gilligan sticks his finger in the paint and brings it to his mouth to taste it. It tastes good. GILLIGAN Mmmm. In case the play's a flop, we can always eat the scenery. PROFESSOR I thought you were supposed to be fixing that door. GILLIGAN I already finished it. Look. Here. Gilligan walks over to the stage door and demonstrates that it opens out from the stage. GILLIGAN (cont'd) See? It works just fine. The Professor follows Gilligan to the door. PROFESSOR Oh no, Gilligan, that's wrong. The door should open in, not out. GILLIGAN Why? It works fine. What's wrong with it having open out? Gilligan demonstrates quickly opening the door out. Skipper cries out. Gilligan's face expresses that he realizes he struck down Skipper backstage. Professor opens the door more fully to reveal Skipper lying on the ground. DOLLY THROUGH DOOR TO BACKSTAGE GILLIGAN (cont'd) Sorry, Skipper. I didn't know you were there. SKIPPER Gilligan, how do you manage to always do something that -- Never mind, Gilligan!

MARY ANN Skipper? Oh, I'm glad you're here. I want you to try on this toga that I made for you to see if it's big enough. Mary Ann puts the toga over Skipper's head. MARY ANN (cont'd) Put your head through there. Like that. SKIPPER Where do I put the rest of it, Mary -- ? MARY ANN There! Wait, wait. Mary Ann puts the head wear on Skipper.

Mr. Howell walks over to a chair on stage and picks it up. MR HOWELL Well, I know in the play Cleopatra's crazy about you, but you're not exactly my type. Mr. Howell steps off the stage and places his director's chair in front of the stage. MR HOWELL (cont'd) By the way, where is the Queen of the Nile? GINGER Here I am. How do I look? Ginger walks to Mr. Howell, who stands in front of the stage. MR HOWELL Oh, you look ravishing. I must say, you look ravishing. I envy that snake, my dear. GINGER Thanks. MR HOWELL Shall we get on with it? All right, everyone. Clear the stage. Clear the stage. Ginger steps up onto the stage. Gilligan, Professor and Skipper exit through the stage door to backstage. Mr. Howell directs. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Now, in this one, you haven't seen your lover for ages. You understand? You're yearning for him. You're pining for him. You're by the window when you see the ship. All right. All right. Places. Let's go. Mr. Howell sits in his director's chair. GINGER "Look! I see a ship. In the harbor! I see a ship!"

MR HOWELL (cont'd) -- what are you doing? GILLIGAN Oh, it's just the play. MR HOWELL Yes, yes. Would you mind clearing this -- Get off there! Where were we? Oh, yes, yes. You're over there by the window, and the maid brings the nectar. Is the maid there? MRS HOWELL Yes, I'm ready. MR HOWELL All right. Places. Take it from the top. GINGER "A ship! Look! In the harbor. I see a ship!" Mrs. Howell, costumed as the maid, fumbles with the tray, drops a drinking glass, picks it up. MR HOWELL What is this? Hurry, dear! Mrs. Howell enters, pushing the stage door in, and carries a tray and drinking glass. She fumbles and tries to balance the drinking glass on the tray. MRS HOWELL "I bring you --" Mrs. Howell drops the drinking glass. MR HOWELL Oh, go get it! MRS HOWELL (to Mr. Howell) Don't yell at me. (to Ginger) "I bring you --" Mrs. Howell fumbles with the tray and drinking glass. MRS HOWELL (cont'd) "I bring you nectar, my Queen." Mrs. Howell steps in front of Ginger. Mrs. Howell's back is to Mr. Howell. MR HOWELL Lovey, my dear, you mustn't cross in front of a big star. MRS HOWELL Oh? MR HOWELL Try it again. Mrs. Howell walks behind Ginger and repeats her line. MRS HOWELL "I bring you nectar, my Queen." Ginger spins to face Mrs. Howell. GINGER "Thank you!" MR HOWELL No, Ginger. Ginger, you mustn't say "thank you." See, that's a servant. That's a nonentity, a very lowly person. You understand? Ginger smiles while Mrs. Howell maintains a straight face. MR HOWELL (cont'd) And incidentally, you look every inch a queen. Ginger preens at the compliments. Mrs. Howell skeptically looks at Ginger. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Proud and beautiful accustomed to the adoration of the world. Mr. Howell positively beams at Ginger. MRS HOWELL Thurston. MR HOWELL You're beautiful. MRS HOWELL Thurston! MR HOWELL Oh, yes, yes. What is it, dear? MRS HOWELL I'd like a word with you. Alone. MR HOWELL Yes, yes, of course.

OFFSTAGE - DAY Mrs. Howell confers with Mr. Howell regarding the part Mrs. Howell thinks she deserves. MR HOWELL Yes, my dear, what is it? MRS HOWELL Thurston, do you remember the day we got married? MR HOWELL Indeed, I do. That was the day Consolidated General jumped seventeen points. MRS HOWELL Do you still love me? MR HOWELL Of course I do, darling. I adore you. You're -- you're Missus Thurston Howell the Third. MRS HOWELL Well, doesn't it bother you that Missus Thurston Howell the Third -- should have such a teensy-weensy part in her husband's play? MR HOWELL I never thought of it that way. MRS HOWELL A Howell playing a maid. MR HOWELL It isn't exactly typecasting, is it? But the only parts left are -- Let's see, the high priestess? (beat) Slave girl? (beat) Lady-in-waiting? (beat) Well, the only part left is Cleopatra. Mrs. Howell beams and smiles broadly. Mr. Howell smiles uncomfortably. FLIP TO: EXT.

Gilligan turns to exit, but runs into the scenery. MR HOWELL Really. All right, Lovey, my dear. Take it from the top. MRS HOWELL "A ship. Look. In the harbor. I see a ship." MR HOWELL That's the cue for the maid to enter with the nectar. Where's the maid? Ginger! Ginger! Where's Ginger? Gilligan enters through the stage door. GILLIGAN I'm sorry, Mister Howell, but I'm afraid Cleopatra'll have to go on the wagon. Ginger refuses to play the part of the maid. MRS HOWELL Oh, dear. It's so hard to keep help these days. GILLIGAN Pretty hard, Mister Howell. She went back to her hut. I think she was crying. Mr. Howell throws a childish fit. MR HOWELL Oh, temperament! I tell you, all you actresses are little children in a tantrum world! Oh, you're all against me! I can't put on a show with this temperament. Do you hear me? If there's one thing I can't stand, it's temperament! Mr. Howell throws his hat to the ground and stomps on it in a tantrum, and finally sits on the stage. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GIRLS HUT - DAY Ginger sits crying while Gilligan and Mary Ann attempt to console her. Mary Ann wears her high priestess costume. GILLIGAN Don't cry, Ginger. I know how you feel, but it's not the end of the world. GINGER I was gonna be discovered. I was gonna open on Broadway. I was gonna be a star! And now look at me! GILLIGAN You're right. It's the end of the world. MARY ANN Oh, Gilligan, stop that. Oh, that's no way to cheer her up. GILLIGAN Oh yeah, I was supposed to cheer her up. (cheerfully) Look on the bright side, Ginger. Maybe we'll never be rescued -- and maybe we'll be marooned on this island for the rest of our lives. Then there'll be no Broadway, no play, no nothing. Gilligan laughs uncomfortably. GINGER I may do something desperate. MARY ANN Oh, Gilligan, out. Mary Ann points to the door. GILLIGAN Huh? MARY ANN Out! Go out! GILLIGAN Are you trying to tell me something? Mary Ann grabs a broom and chases Gilligan out the door. MARY ANN I certainly am. Out, Gilligan! Gilligan exits. Mary Ann closes the door behind him. FLIP TO: EXT. BACKSTAGE - DAY Skipper rehearses his lines as Marc Antony. SKIPPER "Oh, my fair Queen, come away with me and share my life --" Gilligan enters and interrupts. GILLIGAN Skipper? SKIPPER Just a minute, Gilligan. GILLIGAN But, Skipper, I want to talk to you. It's about Ginger. Remember we decided to put this play on -- SKIPPER Gilligan, please. Can't you see that I'm rehearsing my lines? GILLIGAN Oh. SKIPPER "Oh, my fair Queen, come away with me and share my lot. Our love will --" Skipper glaces at the script. SKIPPER (cont'd) "Our love will last all through e--" Skipper checks the script for the next word. SKIPPER (cont'd) "-- eternity. Eternity. Eternity." GILLIGAN Now can we talk, huh, Skipper, huh? Now can we talk? SKIPPER Well, you're a fine pal. I mean, what'd you think of my acting? GILLIGAN Your acting? SKIPPER That last speech I made. What did you think of it? GILLIGAN I don't know. I wasn't listening. SKIPPER Oh, Gilligan, well, listen this time. I'll do it again. I want your opinion. GILLIGAN But Skipper, I want to talk to you. SKIPPER Gilligan, will you stop and listen? Skipper rehearses his lines. SKIPPER (cont'd) "0h, my fair Queen --" Gilligan applauds. GILLIGAN That was just great, Skipper. Just great. SKIPPER Gilligan, I haven't even said it. GILLIGAN Yeah, but now can we talk? SKIPPER (angrily) Will you go away and let me alone and do my rehearsing by myself? GILLIGAN Yes, sir. Gilligan exits. Skipper gives an aside glance and then continues rehearsing. SKIPPER Oh, my fair Gilligan -- Skipper lowers his head after flubbing the line. Skipper attempts to raise his arm to dramatically gesture, but his Marc Antony costume is tangled around his arm. SKIPPER (cont'd) Oh, my -- Skipper moves the fabric and tries again. SKIPPER (cont'd) oh, my fair -- Skipper's efforts only make the problem worse. FLIP TO: EXT. STAGE - DAY Mrs. Howell is costumed as Cleopatra. She rehearses her performance. Her voice is lower and husky as Cleopatra. Mr. Howell directs her performance on stage. He is dressed as a director and carries a cane. MRS HOWELL "My heart, it beats so. I can scarce hear my lover's approach." MR HOWELL That is very good. Very good, Lovey. Now remember, Cleopatra is a woman of passion and she is waiting for her lover, Marc Antony, to return from Rome. Got that? MRS HOWELL I think so. As Mr. Howell describes how Cleopatra feels, Mrs. Howell gestures to each body part in turn. MR HOWELL Your eyes are glowing. Your temples are pounding. Your heart is beating fast. Your anxiety is such that you can hardly breathe. Mrs. Howell inhales and exhales quickly. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Just pretend that you've eaten a Hungarian dinner. MRS HOWELL Oh, yes! MR HOWELL Very good. I knew you'd get it. Mr. Howell crosses the stage to the door. MR HOWELL (cont'd) (to Skipper) Are you ready, Marc Antony? Skipper opens the stage door from backstage. SKIPPER I'm ready, Mister Howell. Just give me my cue. Mr. Howell steps off the stage and walks to his chair. MR HOWELL Good, good, good. Curtain. Lights. You're on, my dear. Mr. Howell taps his cane on the stage. MRS HOWELL "My heart it beats so. I can scarce hear my lover's approach." EXT. BACKSTAGE - DAY Skipper waits backstage for his cue. Gilligan enters. GILLIGAN Skipper, can I talk to you? SKIPPER Not now, Gilligan. I'm -- I'm waiting for my cue. EXT. STAGE - DAY MRS HOWELL "My heart, it beats so. I can scarce hear my lover's approach." EXT. BACKSTAGE - DAY SKIPPER That's my cue. GILLIGAN Please, Skipper, please? EXT. STAGE - DAY Skipper, costumed as Marc Antony, enters via the stage door. He walks over to Mrs. Howell and stops. MR HOWELL Well, Marc Antony, say something. SKIPPER I forgot my line, Mister Howell. Mr. Howell rolls his eyes. MR HOWELL "Oh gracious Queen, greet thy happy sailor." Trippingly. SKIPPER I've got it now. I got it. Skipper exits through the stage door. EXT. BACKSTAGE - DAY Skipper enters from the stage. GILLIGAN Now, Skipper? Now? SKIPPER Not now, Gilligan. GILLIGAN But you promised. EXT. STAGE - DAY Mrs. Howell overacts her line. MRS HOWELL "My heart, it beats so. I can scarce hear my lover's approach." Skipper enters through the stage door. SKIPPER "Oh, gracious greet, queen thy happy sailor." MR HOWELL In the name of Richard Burton, what are you doing? SKIPPER I'm sorry, Mister Howell. But it's Gilligan. He's pestering me. MR HOWELL Never mind that. We'll take care of that. Do it again, will you please? SKIPPER All right, sir. Skipper turns and walks toward the stage door. EXT. BACKSTAGE - DAY Skipper enters. GILLIGAN Now, Skipper, now, huh? SKIPPER Not now, Gilligan! For goodness sakes, help with the scenery, the props, or do something! EXT. STAGE - DAY Mrs. Howell passionately delivers her line. MRS HOWELL (irritatedly) "My heart, it beats so. I can scarce hear my lover's approach." Skipper enters. SKIPPER "Oh, gracious sailor, queen thy happy greet!" Mrs. Howell rolls her eyes. Mr. Howell rolls his eyes. EXT. BACKSTAGE - DAY Gilligan moves a ladder. SKIPPER (O.S.) Please, Mister Howell, once more? EXT. STAGE - DAY SKIPPER Just once more? All right. Skipper exits through the stage door. MRS HOWELL Really, darling. How can I perform when the other actors can't remember their lines? MR HOWELL Never mind, Lovey. Calm down. He's a slow study. PAN ON Gilligan as he enters carrying a ladder across the stage in front the actors. MRS HOWELL (irritated) "I can scarce hear my --" MR HOWELL (O.S.) Gilligan! MR HOWELL What are you doing with that ladder? GILLIGAN The Professor has to paint the scenery. MR HOWELL Well, not now. We're rehearsing! GILLIGAN Okay. I'll take it backstage. Gilligan carries the ladder and lines it up to take it through the stage door. MRS HOWELL "I can scarce hear my lover's approach." Skipper opens the door and enters. Skipper runs into the rungs of the ladder. SKIPPER as he breaks all of the rungs until he is face to face with Gilligan. Skipper gives an aside glance. FLIP TO: INT. HOWELLS HUT - DAY Mr. Howell and Mrs. Howell discuss the play. Mrs. Howell sits at her table in front of a small mirror. Mr. Howell gushes about the play. MR HOWELL That last rehearsal, my dear, was simply marvelous. With my directing and my producing, this play could be a big Broadway hit. MRS HOWELL Thurston, you haven't said a word about my performance. MR HOWELL No, I haven't, have I? Well, it's an oversight on my part. May I say, my dear, that you are simply splendid. MRS HOWELL Oh, thank you, Thurston. Even Ginger, whom I replaced in the part, paid me a compliment. She compared me to a famous television personality. MR HOWELL Oh, good. MRS HOWELL By the way, who is Mister Ed? MR HOWELL I haven't any idea. I wonder why she didn't compare you to Missus Ed. I can't wait for tomorrow night. Opening night. Lot of details to attend to, my dear. See you later. Gilligan enters. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Hello, Gilligan, my boy. GILLIGAN Hi Mister Howell. Can I talk to Missus Howell? MR HOWELL There she is, Cleopatra. See you later. Mr. Howell exits. Mrs. Howell checks her makeup in the mirror. GILLIGAN Hi, Missus Howell. I hope you're not gonna get mad at me for what I'm gonna say. It's got nothing to do with your acting. I think that's real good. Maybe even better than Mister Ed's. But, you see, the reason we put this play on in the first place was because Ginger was feeling so terrible about Broadway and you're a very important woman, Missus Howell, and you got everything you want, but this play is the only thing Ginger's got. I hope you're not getting mad at me. See, Ginger's getting real desperate and I thought that maybe if you'd, uh -- I guess you're getting mad at me. You haven't said a single word. Mrs. Howell motions to her throat. GILLIGAN (cont'd) What? Gilligan leans in to hear what she's trying to say. GILLIGAN (cont'd) What's the matter, Missus Howell? Mister Howell? Mister Howell? Mr. Howell enters. MR HOWELL What is it, Gilligan? GILLIGAN She's talking, but nothing's coming out. MR HOWELL Lovey, my dear, what is it? Mrs. Howell motions to her throat. MR HOWELL (cont'd) By George, she's got Laryngitis. GILLIGAN Yeah. She lost her voice, too. MR HOWELL A star with Laryngitis. It's the scourge of every producer. GILLIGAN What're you gonna do, Mister Howell? MR HOWELL I'll have to call off the show. I'm an angel with my wings clipped. GILLIGAN Why don't you use Ginger? She knows all the lines. MR HOWELL Well, I don't know -- GILLIGAN Mister Howell, I saw a movie once and just before the star went on, she fell and broke both her arms. (puzzled) Or was it both her legs? (pause) Well, anyhow, there was a girl in the chorus and she knew the lines and the dances and the producer was going nuts and he yelled -- MR HOWELL Get the understudy! GILLIGAN You saw the picture, too. MR HOWELL On the late show. Go, my boy! Gilligan exits. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Lovey, try. Mrs. Howell motions to her throat and shakes her head. FLIP TO: EXT. STAGE - NIGHT PROGRAM FAN DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL Gilligan holding a woven fan that reads "PROGRAM" on the back and "Act I: Courtyard, Act II: Palace, and Act III: Queen's Chambers" on the front. He ushers the Howells to their seats. Mr. Howell directs Mrs. Howell to their seats in the second row on the left side of the aisle. MR HOWELL Here we go, my dear. Gilligan directs Mr. Howell to the front row on the right side of the aisle. GILLIGAN Oh, no, sir. Here's your seat right up here, sir. MR HOWELL Nonsense. I always sit second row center with Missus Howell! GILLIGAN May I see your ticket, please, sir? MR HOWELL May you see it -- Mr. Howell searches his pockets. MR HOWELL (cont'd) (angrily) What are you talking about?! Mr. Howell takes the program from Gilligan and directs him backstage. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Get backstage, will you? All right. The first-nighters are here. Curtain! The curtain opens. Brass horn fanfare plays. The Howells applaud. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Beautiful set! The music changes to a full orchestra. Ginger enters. She twirls and bows. The Howells applaud. EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT Gilligan prepares to go on stage as the maid. GINGER (O.S.) "A ship! Look, in the harbor. I see a ship!" EXT. STAGE - NIGHT Gilligan, costumed as the maid, enters through the stage door. He carries a tray with a drinking glass on it. GILLIGAN "Your nectar, oh my Queen." GINGER "Oh, no. No, no, no. I'm too excited. My lover's ship is in the harbor." Ginger pulls a message from her cleavage. GINGER (cont'd) "Oh, I must send him this message. Send in the royal messenger." Gilligan reaches to take the message, but Ginger withdraws it. GINGER (cont'd) "No, no, no." Gilligan turns to leave and puts the TRAY under his arm. The glass is affixed to the tray so it does not fall off. EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT Gilligan quick changes into the messenger costume. Mary Ann and Professor help him. Mary Ann wears a high priestess toga. Professor wears his usual attire. EXT. STAGE - NIGHT GILLIGAN "You sent for me, 0h Queen?" GINGER "Oh, yes, yes, I did. I want you to send this message to my lover Marc Antony." Gilligan reaches for the message, but Ginger withdraws it. GINGER (cont'd) "But wait. No. You will be recognized. Send in my maid." GILLIGAN Huh? GINGER "My maid. Send my maid in." GILLIGAN "Yes, 0h Queen." EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT Gilligan quick changes back into the maid costume. Mary Ann and Professor help him. EXT. STAGE - NIGHT Gilligan enters costumed as the maid. GILLIGAN "You sent for me, 0h Queen?" GINGER "Oh, yes, yes. I've decided that you must take this message to my lover, Marc Antony." GILLIGAN "Yes, 0h Queen." GINGER "But wait! A woman. You will be suspect. Send in my aged, but trustworthy major-domo. Send him in immediately." GILLIGAN Yeah, it figures. Why don't you give me the message, and I can give it to him? GINGER "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I must -- I must entrust it to him with my own hands." EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT Gilligan quick changes into the major-domo costume. Mary Ann and Professor help him. EXT. STAGE - NIGHT Gilligan enters costumed as the major-domo. GILLIGAN "Your maid said you wanted me, 0h Queen?" GINGER "Yes, yes. Deliver this message, but be careful. Caesar's spies are everywhere." GILLIGAN "I will be careful, 0h Queen." GINGER "You know what to do if you're caught?" GILLIGAN "I'll eat it." GINGER "Good, good, good. This message must not fall into Caesar's hands. Hark! I hear footsteps. It's Caesar!" Gilligan eats the message. Ginger moves to the stage door and peers out. GINGER (cont'd) "No, I was mistaken. It's not Caesar. Give me back the message." Ginger holds out her hand. GINGER (cont'd) "Give me back the message." Gilligan swallows. GILLIGAN "Too late, oh Queen." Gilligan motions to his chest as if he has trouble swallowing the message. Ginger glares at him. MR HOWELL It's wonderful, dear, and the next act is even more dramatic. EXT. STAGE - NIGHT Gilligan, costumed as a slave, wears a ball and chain. Gilligan fans Ginger, who reclines on a day bed. GINGER "My heart, it beats so." Gilligan's fan falls into Ginger's face so she pushes it out of the way. GINGER (cont'd) "I can scarce hear my lover's approach." Loud footsteps. Gilligan turns to the door so the fan falls into Ginger's face. Ginger pushes the fan out of her face. GINGER (cont'd) "Slave, open the door." Gilligan drags the ball and chain toward the door. Cleopatra grows impatient. GINGER (cont'd) "Slave, open the door." Gilligan picks up the ball and chain and moves to the door. Gilligan sets the fan down next to the door, which he opens for Skipper costumed as Marc Antony. Gilligan moves around behind him. Skipper stands in the doorway. SKIPPER "Oh gracious Queen, greet thy happy sailor!" Skipper enters. Gilligan stands on the tail of Skipper's toga. As Skipper moves onto the stage, his costume tears in half. PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN as they stand in the stage wing. Mary Ann covers her eyes after seeing Skipper in his undergarments. Mary Ann peeks to see if Skipper has covered himself and re-covers her eyes. Professor quickly closes the curtain. BACK TO SCENE The curtain closes as the play cast scrambles to recover. MR HOWELL Wasn't she magnificent, dear? MRS HOWELL Bravo, bravo! MR HOWELL Bravo, bravo. What did you say? MRS HOWELL I said, "bravo." MR HOWELL You didn't have Laryngitis after all. You were just being noble. MRS HOWELL I was just being a Howell. MR HOWELL Bravo! The curtain opens. Ginger bows. Mary Ann enters and motions for the Professor to join her on stage. Gilligan and Skipper correctly adjust Skipper's costume. MR HOWELL (cont'd) Bravo! MRS HOWELL Bravo! MR HOWELL Bravo! Simply marvelous! Gilligan drops the ball on Skipper's foot. Skipper cries out in pain. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO TAG FADE IN: EXT. CAMP - DAY Skipper walks through the jungle. SKIPPER Gilligan! Gilligan pulls his clothesline taut. It rises up from the ground. SKIPPER (cont'd) Gilligan, little buddy! Skipper runs into Gilligan's clothes line. He is caught at the neck and is flung backward as if snapped by a large rubber band. Skipper's size causes tension on the clothesline and pulls Gilligan back to the outside wall of the hut. Gilligan pulls the line taut again, turns, and sees the Skipper lying on the ground. Gilligan runs over to the Skipper lying on the jungle floor. Gilligan helps Skipper to his feet. GILLIGAN Come on, Skipper. Here. I'm sorry, Skipper. SKIPPER Gilligan, never mind. Never mind, Gilligan. Gilligan and Skipper walk back to the clearing. GILLIGAN I was just hanging up the wash to dry. SKIPPER I saw that you were. Now, Gilligan, I want to talk to you about something. Well, Mister Howell really liked the play, didn't he? GILLIGAN He sure did. He's gonna put it on Broadway when we get off the island. SKIPPER Exactly. Now, Gilligan, I want you to forget something. Understand? I want you to forget that I'm your Skipper. GILLIGAN It's forgotten. SKIPPER And I want you to forget that you work for me. GILLIGAN It's forgotten. SKIPPER And I want you to forget that I'm twice as big as you are. GILLIGAN It's forgotten. Skipper places his arm around Gilligan's shoulders. SKIPPER Good. Gilligan, what did you think of my Marc Antony, little buddy? GILLIGAN It's forgotten. Skipper removes his arm from Gilligan's shoulders. SKIPPER Come on now, Gilligan. What did you really think? PARROT sits on a branch in a tree. PARROT Terrible, terrible, terrible. BACK TO SCENE GILLIGAN Don't pay any attention to him. He just says what he's taught. SKIPPER Uh-huh. And who's been teaching him? PARROT (O.S.) Gilligan, Gilligan, ... PARROT sits on a branch in a tree. PARROT ... Gilligan. BACK TO SCENE The parrot SQUAWKS. GILLIGAN Blabbermouth. Skipper nods at Gilligan and gives an aside glance. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GILLIGAN'S ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY FADE OUT. THE END 
The ghost of Hyde! -How was the magic show tonight? -Terrific. -And so are these double-fudge sundaes. -With a pickle on top. -l want to do a magic trick. -You want to do a magic trick? Like, this l got to see. Hocus-pocus, alley-oop. Hey! What kind of a magic trick is that? That's called ''the vanishing ice-cream trick,'' Shaggy. Well, next time he tries it, l'm gonna pull ''the vanishing Scooby trick. '' Come on, gang. lt's time we head for home. Yeah, l wanna catch the early late show on TV. lt's called I Was a Teenage Blob. l saw that. Boy, was it corny. The blob would hide in the back of cars and wait for his victims. This creepy shortcut you're taking, Freddy, gives me the chills. -Yeah. Like, me too. -That's because the heater is broken. Scooby, fetch the beach blanket so we can bundle up. Okay. Excuse me. Like, what is it, Scoob? l think he's had too many ice creams. A ghost! Look! The ghost is going into the marshes. Did you get a look at his face? Yeah. He'd make a fortune renting himself out to Halloween parties. That's not what l meant. That's the ghost of Mr. Hyde. You mean that creepy jewel thief who's been scaring everybody in town? The very same. Like, l wonder what Hyde was doing hiding in the Mystery Machine. Well, there's one way to find out. Come on, let's follow him. He went into that spooky-looking old house. They always do. -Don't tell me you're scared. -Me, scared? Like, don't be silly. Then why are you biting Scooby's nails? So l am. Sorry, Scooby. Come on. Let's see if we can find a back way into that creepy old place. Hey, the back door is unlocked. This is gonna be easier than we thought. -What happened? -What was that? Like, wouldn't you know that back door would trigger a trap door? Yeah, and look where we landed. Right in the middle of a mad scientist-type laboratory. lt must belong to the ghost of Hyde. Zoinks! Someone's coming. Hey, that's not Hyde. What are you kids doing here? Would you believe we're looking for a ghost? That's how we ended up in your lab, Dr. Jekyll. Boy, are we glad you didn't turn out to be Mr. Hyde. -Yeah. Glad. -Well, kids. . . . . . l'm not so sure l'm not the ghost. What do you mean, Dr. Jekyll? Like my great-grandfather, the first Dr. Jekyll. . . . . . l may also be changing into the horrible Mr. Hyde. . . . . . but this time as his ghost. -Ghost? -Ghost? -But how, sir? -For the past three years. . . . . . l've been working on a vitamin formula. . . . . . that you only have to take once in your life. Last week, l perfected it. And all that was left to do was to test it. But something must have gone wrong. I became dizzy. And the room began to spin. Several hours later, I was awakened by my housekeeper, Helga who found me on the floor. l had fresh mud on my shoes, like l'd been out in the marsh. The same thing happened tonight. And when l awoke, l found these in my pocket. That's the necklace we saw the ghost of Hyde holding. -That's real. -So you see. . . . . . there is no doubt that l am the ghost of Hyde. There's one thing that puzzles me. lf you were in the swamp, how come the mud on your shoes is dry? That is strange. There's something strange about this whole thing. We'd like to find out what it is. Not me. Freddy said to search the place from top to bottom. Wouldn't you know we'd be the ones to search the attic? Like, this place looks like a storeroom for spiderwebs. Wow, a spooky room filled with haunted spiderwebs. . . . . . and creepy, old-looking chests. Wonder what's in them. Funny place to keep bats. Hope they've all, like, flown the coop. There's nothing in here but a bunch of old costumes. Somebody around here must have been in show biz. -Shaggy? -Yeah? Zoink! Very funny. Don't take it off. You look better with it on. Now, quit fooling around and help me search. You look on that side, and l'll look on this. Yipe! Nothing in that one. What's with you, Scooby-Doo? That horrible-looking? Come on. We'll sneak up on him. Get ready, Scoob. l'm gonna open the door. Gotcha! Oh, Scooby, you were only looking at yourself in a mirror. This place is creepy. Like, all we're missing is a big, old, scary shadow. Shaggy, look. Zoinks! The door is stuck. lt won't open. Shaggy! Coming, Scoob! We're goners. Friends of the doctor's, no doubt. You must be Helga. We thought you were the ghost of Hyde. Well, you can see l'm not. And you've made a mess of the attic just after l finished cleaning it. Cleaned it? Like, l wonder what it looked like before she cleaned it. l hope Shaggy and Scooby are having better luck than we are. Wait a minute. l think l found a clue. Looks like someone was in a hurry to burn something in the fireplace. -lt's an old newspaper clipping. -And listen to this. Human-fly act? Yeah. lt's a daring acrobatic act done on tall buildings and other high places. Why should a circus star be working as a housemaid in a creepy place like this? l don't know. Maybe one of these books will give us a clue. -Maybe. -Here's one. A Hundred and One Ghosts and Ghouls. Zoinks! We hit the jackpot. Hi, kids. Uncle Happy Time here, once again, with your favorite dog star. . . -. . . King of the Wild Blue Yonder. -Hi, kiddies. lf you don't sign the treaty, Running Dog. . . . . . we'll take back the trinkets and beads. -lndian giver. -Then go. You know, you ought to get this set fixed. -This chute leads to the laundry room. -l wonder what's down there. l wonder what's happened to Shag and Scoob. We haven't heard a peep out of them. Look out below! Duck! A perfect three-point landing. You mean four-point landing. What were you running from in the first place? -Old horrible Hyde. -You saw him? ln glowing color. Like, Dr. Jekyll must have changed again. He couldn't have. We just saw him reading in his study. Hey, Shaggy. Look. lt looks like someone was ironing a shirt with muddy shoes. You mean it looks more like someone was hiding a pair of muddy shoes. And where did this feather duster come from? That's the one Helga was cleaning spiderwebs with. -That's the one. -Velma? -Shaggy? Scooby? -Are you guys all right? -Couldn't be better. We found a clue. -Yeah. Clue. And l have a hunch we'll find a few more answers. . . . . . to this mystery in Helga's room. Helga's room? Here it is. Come on. Let's go in. lf you don't mind, l'll wait out here and guard this bowl of fruit. -Guard it? -Sure. What safer place than in my stomach? Come on, Scoob. So far, no luck. -Let's see what's under the mattress. -Hey, look, a can of phosphorus paint. And a bottle of knockout drops. Are you thinking what l'm thinking, Freddy? l'm thinking this mystery is pretty close to being solved. We better tell Dr. Jekyll what we found. Hey, gang, did l find something interesting in the fruit bowl. -The ghost of Hyde! -And he's got Shaggy. Shaggy! They're gone, vanished. Come on. We've got to find him, and fast. Shaggy! Shaggy! What are you gonna do with me? You're gonna turn me into a frog. Like, l think he's going to croak me. Scooby-Doo, where are you? Shaggy! l wish l had a Scooby Snack. Shaggy, Scooby. -Thank goodness you're safe. -You mean thank Scooby we're safe. What l'd like to know is why Hyde was after you, Shag. Maybe he was, like, after these suction cups. l found them in the fruit bowl. Sounds pretty silly to me. What would he want with suction cups? Beats me, but with the clues we have so far. . . . . . it's for sure the ghost of Hyde is a 24-carat phony. And we know who that -We do? -Now it's our turn. . . . . . to scare the hide off of Hyde. The plan's working, Scoob. We'll lure him into the trick trap. No! Ghosts! -lt worked. -Ghosts! -He's headed for the back door. -And the trap door. -We got him, Scooby. -Scooby-Doo! Nice catch, guys. Now to unmask this phony Hyde. And if our calculations are right, it should be Helga, the housemaid. Dr. Jekyll! So it really was Dr. Jekyll behind the ghost of Hyde jewel robberies. lt sure was, sheriff. When all his crazy experiments failed. . . . . . Dr. Jekyll decided to turn to a life of crime. But one thing he didn't count on was us following him into the marsh. And, like, when he figured he might be caught. . . . . . he came up with the idea of framing Helga, the maid. Shame on you, Dr. Jekyll. First he told us that phony story about the formula. Then he planted fake clues for us to find. . . . . . that would make it look like Helga was the ghost of Hyde. His plan almost worked, except that Shaggy found the suction cups. . . . . . which turned out to be the real clue. When he tried to get them back and keep Shag from telling. . . . . . everything backfired, and he ended up caught in one of our traps. Why were the suction cups such an important clue? -Show him, Scoob. -Okay. Dr. Jekyll had to use the suction cups to scale the buildings. lf Helga was the ghost of Hyde, she wouldn't have needed them. . . -. . . because she was an ex-circus star. -Hey, like, look. Scoob thinks he's a circus star too. Oh, no, Scooby's gonna fall. l gotta admit, that's some act. Scooby-Doo! SDl Media Group [ENGLlSH] 
What a nervous night to be walking home from the movies, Scooby-Doo. And all because you had to stay and see. . . . . . Star: Dog Ranger of the North Woods twice. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! -What's that? -lt's coming from the bushes. Go see what it is, Scooby. -Don't worry, l'm right behind you. -Thanks a lot. Oh, well. Scooby, come back! Wait! Where he go? Where he go? -Like, next time, signal. -Sorry. Hey, what's that? Looks like a deserted-type pickup truck. Anyone home? You're right, Shaggy. This sure is strange. Yeah. What's an empty, old suit of armor. . . . . . doing in the driver's seat of this pickup? Maybe he went out for the knight. Get it? -Very funny. -Gosh. . . . . . l wonder who this creepy hunk of tin belongs to. Well, the name on the crate says, ''Jameson Hyde White. . . . . . Professor of Archeology. London, England. '' -Hyde White? -l've heard of hide-and-seek before. . . . . . but l've never heard of Hyde White. That's an English name, you comedians. Hey, what's this? lt's a delivery label that says: ''Deliver to the County Museum. '' So that's where the old knight was headed for. That's using the old noodle. But, like, what happened to our mysterious professor? Well, if he was driving this truck, he's disappeared. Well, gang, it looks like we're up to our armor plates in another mystery. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. l suppose l should thank you for finding the Black Knight. But with Professor Hyde White's mysterious disappearance and all. . . . . . l wish you hadn't. -Why is that, Mr. Wickles? -Because of the legend. -Legend? -Yes. The Black Knight is supposed to come alive when the moon is full. Like, wow! The moon was full last night. Then what was the professor doing with tall, tin, dark and creepy? He was delivering it to the museum. All the way from England. -Where do you want it, Mr. Wickles? -Just put it in the Medieval Room. Right. What's this? Scooby-Doo, where are you? -Come on, Scooby. We're leaving. -Coming. This mystery's got me baffled. Well, it's got me, like, hungry. When do we eat? -Let's eat! -Hey, what's Scooby wearing? They look like some crazy kind of glasses. -He must've found them at the museum. -Yeah, yeah. Man, l wonder what kind of groovy things you see with those. Well, there's one way to find out. Here it is! They're a special type of magnifying glasses. . . . . . used by jewelers, scientists and archeologists. And hold on to your Hula-Hoops. lt says here, ''made only in England. '' -Archeologists? -England? Professor Hyde White! That settles it. There's something fishy going on in that museum. -Museum? -Right, Scooby. Tonight we're going fishing. This place is locked up tighter than a drum. Then, like, how do we get in? Easy. Shaggy goes through that window up there. -Why me? -Because that's a small window. . . -. . . and you're the thinnest. -Oh, boy. Come on, give me a hand with this ladder. -lt won't reach. -l guess we don't get in. Well, if we don't, we'll never find out what happened to the missing professor. Shaggy, you start up, and l'll get the jack out of the Mystery Machine. Right. -Hang on, Shaggy. -Like, right, man. l'll start cranking. And l'll keep hanging on. -That's it, no more jack. -He still can't reach it. Don't worry. Shaggy's the swingingest gymnast in school. When you get in, open the back door. Right. Watch me swing right in. Well, at least we know he's inside. The Black Knight. Sure glad it's empty. Golly, this place sure is creepy at night. lt's even creepy during the day. l think we'd better split up. Daphne and l will go this way. . . . . . you two go that way. And, Scooby, stand guard. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? -Two? -Okay, two it is. Scooby-Doo! Yikes! -l think we're being followed. -Yeah, by Scooby. All right, Scooby-Doo, you can come with us. All right, all right. Down, down. What did you do that for? You know how that full moon turns on that Black Knight. -That's only a superstitious legend. -Well, l'm not taking any chances. l'm with you. Oh, no, we lost Shaggy. l hope we find Shaggy soon. Stop that noise. l've got it! That's better. Come on. What a spooky place. Not now, Scooby. Not now. Now, look what that dog did. He knows l can't see without my glasses. There you are, Shaggy. You sound terrible. l told you to take care of that cold. Lucky l brought your medicine. l can't find that Velma nowheres. Zoinks! This will fix you up in a jiffy. Let's get out of here! See? You sound better already. Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Sorry! Bye-bye! l tell you, the Black Knight is alive. . . . . . and roaming through the hallways. lf we could only find a clue. lt's Scooby! When Velma said, ''clue,'' she didn't mean you, Scooby. Hey, like, wait a minute. There's a picture missing from the wall. Maybe that's a clue. -We better tell the others. -Right! lt's right down here. -There's no picture missing, Shaggy. -Well, it was a minute ago. Some clue. Well, if that's blood. . . . . . that's a clue. lt's paint. And look. A trail of it leads down the hallway. Come on, follow that paint. The trail of paint ends here at the mummy case. Come on, Shaggy. Help me open it. Don't like surprises, especially spooky ones. Oh, come on. Hey, look, a secret room. Somebody sure is a messy housekeeper. And look at that. There are two paintings exactly alike. Are you thinking what l'm thinking? Right, Velma. This just about solves the mystery. -lt does? -What? No time to explain now, Shaggy. We gotta get the sheriff. Let's take this back way out. Leave it to Daphne to pick the wrong door. Zoinks! Scooby, like, do something. Maybe my ventriloquism bit can get us out of this jam. lf l can throw my voice to make it sound like it's coming from the room. . . . . . he might leave. Help! Let me out of this pot! -Help! -Help! Scooby-Doo! Zoinks! Scooby! Yikes! Scooby-Doo! We did it, Scooby-Doo. We did it. We did? Scooby-Doo! -Just as we thought! -lt's the curator, Mr. Wickles. We've gotta hand it to you kids. We never would have suspected Wickles as the art swindler. Boy, it was a neat setup. He and his gang were switching fake pieces of art. . . . . . for the real ones in the museum. They made the fakes at night, in a secret workshop behind the mummy case. That's why they had to get rid of the professor. He was the only one who could have spotted the fakes. Oh, my gosh! Professor Hyde White! We never found him. -lt's Scooby-Doo with a shoe. -Follow me! See? Professor Hyde White! All the time, it was Wickles who made that Black Knight come to life. -Then there was no legend. -Positively not. Wickles just used the story to cover up my mysterious disappearance. Somehow, he managed to get into the armor, down at the train station. And, like, on the way to the museum, he made you disappear. Zoinks! He's alive! Scooby-Doo! SDl Media Group [ENGLlSH] 
What's that? The ghost of Red Beard! Listen: ''Coast Guard baffled as third freighter raided within a week. '' ''C. L. Magnus, owner of shipping line. . . . . . claims it's the ghost of Red Beard the pirate seeking revenge. '' Like, l'm sure glad he's not seeking my superduper sandwich! Yeah! Yeah! Lucky for him. He'd probably get indigestion. Paw please, Scooby. Now, that's what l call handy bite-size! Delicious! What happened? Poor Mr. Magnus! First he's going out of business, now this ghost pirate shows up. Why would a ghost pirate want revenge on a nice man like Mr. Magnus? l don't know. But maybe we can help him solve this mystery. Let's go see him! -This must be the apartment. -''Penthouse, C. L. Magnus. '' Yes? Excuse us, but we'd like to talk to Mr. Magnus. l'm afraid not. He's not to be disturbed. Well! That slams the door closed on this ghost mystery! lf Mr. Magnus knew we wanted to help, he'd see us. Maybe we still can. l've got an idea. -ls everybody all set? -Okay! Yes? Room service! -Breakfast is served! -At 1 1 :00 at night? Sure, so you don't have to get up in the morning to eat! What's going on in here? Do you believe we're here to help? -Like Good Samaritan Joes! -Yeah, yeah! So, you see, it was over . . . that Red Beard the pirate was the terror of the seven seas. When my ancestors brought him to justice. . . . . . he vowed to return and avenge himself. Now that he has, l'm afraid nothing can be done to stop him. l'm not so sure, Mr. Magnus. Ghosts are our specialty. And l have a plan that l think will work. lf Red Beard sticks to a schedule, he should strike tonight! Yeah! And we are going to be there first, and fool him. There's the Magnus freighter, right on schedule. Good. Now keep your eyes peeled for a mysterious fog bank! That's where we'll find Red Beard's ghost! You can stop looking, it's right ahead! -Let's put Operation Decoy to work! -l'll switch on the tape recorder. Now head into the fog bank, Shaggy. Let's hope that ghost thinks we're the freighter! lt sure is creepy in here. Like, the fog is so thick, you can cut it with a knife. Scooby-Doo! Wow! Look! The ghost ship! Our plan worked too well! lt's going to ram us! -Quick, full-speed reverse! -Like, double full-speed reverse! Start paddling! l'm paddling! But l'm not getting anywhere! -Me, neither! -Hang on! We've been cut in half. -Now what'll we do? -Sink! Oh, my hairdo! Scooby-Doo! Where are you? Hey! Come on, let's get out of this water. And there's only one place to go. The ghost ship! Ghost ship? Oh, boy! One more. . . . . . tug! Well, we're aboard this creaking, creepy craft. Like, let's hope the others made it too. l hope so. Do you see any ghosts? No, this spooky old ship looks deserted to me. lf l know Shag and Scoob, they're already aboard. Let's find them. Yeah, and maybe we can find some clues as well. This must be Red Beard's cabin, Scoob. And look at that kooky picture. That must be Red Beard, himself! Yipe! Help! Zoinks! lt's him! An unfriendly ghost sword! Zoinks! Yipe! That was close! Yeah! Now, let's figure how to. . . . . . get out of here! One, two, three ghosts! For a ghost ship, there sure aren't many ghosts. Maybe they're haunting for a new house. Or out with a couple of old ''ghoul friends. '' Our jokes weren't that funny, Freddy! -l didn't laugh! -Look! Red Beard! Come on, let's follow him, but not too close. -He's gone! -Maybe he went in that door. Let's go take a look. Come on! He's not in here, that's for sure. Thank goodness. This ghost ship is giving me chills! lt's not the ship that's giving you chills. lt's this dry ice. What's dry ice doing on a ghost ship? l don't know, but l think we've found a clue! The door! We're locked in! lt's him! Red Beard! Stop your sniveling, or l'll make you walk the plank! What are you gonna do with us, Your Ghostliness? But if you were good for anything, l'd spare you. -We're good cooks! -Huh? Good cooks, eh? Well, get up and fix me some dinner! And remember, it better be good, or. . . . Aye, aye, sir! Or. . . . Well, the seawater's boiling. l wonder what ghosts like in their stew, Scoob. Chains? Chains! Yeah! Ghosts like chains! And, oh, yeah, some ashes from the stove! -You know, this could be real good! -Yeah, yeah! Now, what else? Cobwebs? Cobwebs! Delightful! Why didn't l think of that? Wow! Now, did we forget anything? Soap! Soap? l hardly use it myself, but why not? l sure hope old Red Beard likes ghost pirate stew! Me too! Ghost pirate stew, eh? You eat it! But we aren't hungry. Eat it! Bubbles? Let's bubble our way out of here! Hey! Stop that! Come on, run! Here comes two of them. And we gotta lose them! And the only way to lose them is to fool them! -First, a paper pirate hat! -Pirate hat? And next, my super Shaggy imitation of Red Beard. They went thattaway! Get going, you swabs! They thought l was Red Beard! Yipes! lt's him again! -They'll never find us under here. -l hope! Only trouble is, l can't see where we're going! Going down! Oh, boy, off of one tub and into another. Shaggy! -Scooby, your voice has changed. -Up here! -Velma! -We're locked in! Don't worry, we'll save you, l think. Come on, Scoob! Follow that ghost ship! So this is where they've been hiding! A secret cove at Skull lsland. Why does a ghost ship need a secret cove? l don't know. This mystery gets more mysterious by the minute! There they go! Keep paddling, Scooby! Yipes! Keep paddling! Quit clowning around! Soon you shall join my crew! What did he mean by that? l guess he means we're going to be ghosts before he's done! l hate to spoil his fun, but we're gonna bust out of here! But how? The key for the lock is way over there! Like this. A pole from this straw, and gum is going to get us the key! lt won't quite reach. One more piece of straw ought to do it. Got it! Let's get out of these creepy caves! You said it! That seagoing spook might show up any minute! -Four tunnels. Which one shall we take? -Mo! -Mo? -Sure! Eenie, meenie, minie, mo! Mo it is! Hi, Velma. Shaggy! Scooby! Hey, Shag, l see you found us! Yeah, now like, let's all get lost! First, get rid of that ridiculous pirate hat you're wearing. Hey! Wait a minute! Let me see that hat! This is a ship's manifest! l've heard of man-o-war, but l've never heard of man-o-fest! lt's a list of the cargo the ship was carrying. . . . . . and how much it was worth. ls that a clue? You bet! Look at the date! That ship won't sail until tomorrow! -How would a ghost get this? -Why would he want it? l have a hunch a little investigation will give us the answer. Come on! l was right! Truck tire tracks! Now we know the ghost drives a truck. Let's see where they go. -Okay, Scooby, follow the tire tracks. -Yeah, yeah! Well, lead on. -A pirate's chest! -lt must contain the truck. . . . . . because that's where the tracks end. lf so, this creepy cave is creepier than l thought! Come on, let's find out what's in the chest. Open it up! What's the password, you swabs? Zoinks! A talking pirate skull! Everybody relax, it's only a mini-microphone and speaker. -What's it mean by ''give the password''? -l don't know, let's give it a try. ''Sixteen men on a pirate's chest''? Let's see. ''Yo-ho-ho, blow the man down''? How about, ''Yum, yum, yum, and a liverwurst a la mode''? Wow! What a password! lt worked this voice-activated secret entrance! -The tire tracks go right inside! -And so are we. Come on! So this is where Red Beard stores his stolen cargo. And this is where Red Beard will keep his secret forever! Zoinks! lt's that goony ghost again! Let's get-- Lower the iron door, and after them! Quick! Behind the crates! Zoinks! lt's the gay blade of the ghost set again! Yoinks! lt's trying to shish kebab us, Scoob! Scooby snacks! Scooby snacks! Boxes of them! -Scooby-Doo! -Scooby-Doo! lf l only had a sword! This nightstick should do it! En garde! -Wow! lt's liverwurst! -Liverwurst! Delicious! Gangway! Behind that barrel! Down the hatch! l should have known! Oil! Make your shots count. l hope this works on ghosts! Bull's-eye! Two down! l mean up! And one Red Beard to go! Now l'll make a pirate's stew out of you! -Hands up and stand back, partner! -An eggbeater? Yeah, an eggbeater! Hey! Let's ride! He'll never catch us on this automatic pogo stick! Pogo stick? This is a jackhammer! -Shaggy! -Scooby! Look out! Look out! The tires! We did it, Scooby! Scooby-Doo! Nice going, kids. Uncovering these phonies and their ship is a job well done! Thanks. Now, let's see whose glowing phosphorous face Red Beard really is! Mr. Magnus! l thought like, the butler always did it! -But who are the other two? -Hired henchmen, l guess. Mr. Magnus was about to lose his business. . . . . . unless he came up with a lot of money! What easier way than to hijack your ships and sell the cargo? They had a neat ghost setup. Down to the ghost sword operated by wires. Where did that mysterious fog come from? -Simple! Like, dry ice! -Dry ice? Sure. All they did was drop dry ice over the side of the ship. And when dry ice mixes with water, it makes a real spooky fog. -Show them, Scooby. -Right! Scooby-Doo! SDl Media Group [ENGLlSH] 
-Sure is a groovy day for a beach party. -l'll say. Shag, how you coming with the surf fishing? Not even a nibble. Scooby, have you had any luck yet? You bet. Hot dogs? Where did you catch them? Watch. Hey, that's our lunch basket. Now, why didn't l think of that? Scooby, that was, like, the one that got away. Very funny. -Come on, Shag. Let's dance. -Just one more cast. l got a feeling l'll catch something this time. -Using a toy mouse for bait? -Sure. -What better way to catch a catfish? -lt figures. Hey, l must have, like, hooked Moby Dick. Give me a hand, Scoob. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. lt must weigh a ton. Zoinks! What's that? lt's a caveman frozen in ice. l wonder where this frozen fright floated in from. l know. l read about it in the paper. Scientists found this 2-million-year-old caveman in the Arctic. A research vessel was taking him to Oceanland. . . . . . when he was lost overboard during a storm at sea. Am l glad he's frozen in there and that we're out here. He won't stay frozen for long. We've got to get him to Oceanland. . . . . . so scientists can put him in the cooler before he melts. Melts? So we didn't waste any time. . . . . . bringing the caveman here to Oceanland, professor. Professor lngstrom and l wish to thank you. . . . . . for rushing our frozen friend to us. -You're welcome. -We're glad to get rid of him. What would have happened if l hadn't hooked that prehistoric ice cube? With the prevailing current, it would've drifted down to Oceanland anyhow. Shouldn't you put him in a refrigerator? Yes, yes. We'll store him in the Arctic room. lt's very cold in there. Wouldn't it be an amazing achievement. . . . . . if we could bring the caveman back to life? lf you don't mind, we like him just the way he is. Well, we got to be going. Come on, Scoob. -Let's go. -Coming. Sorry, madam. Hey. Wait for me. lt's getting late, Professor Wayne. Are you coming? No, Professor lngstrom. l still have some work to do on these notes on Arctic plankton. Very well. l'm going down to the dock. l have some. . . . Some research to do. -Boy, was that good. -You bet. lsn't there anything more to eat? Just two slices of bread and an old ice cube. -l'll take it. -Speaking of ice cubes. . . . . . l wonder how our frozen friend is doing. Zoinks. l just remembered, l left my rod and reel at Oceanland. Well, it's not too late. We'll drive back and get it. This place is spooky at night. -Professor Wayne? Professor lngstrom? -They must've gone home for the night. -We'll have to come back tomorrow. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Let's go. -Wait a minute. -Get a load of this door. -lt's been ripped right off its hinges. lt looks like somebody or something was in a big hurry to get out. -But what? -There's only one way to find out. Yeah. We'll go home and read about it in tomorrow's paper. That's not what l had in mind, Shaggy. Come on. Jumping jellybeans. lt looks like this room's been hit by a cyclone. Hey, look. Professor Wayne's fur parka. -lt's been torn up. -But where's Professor Wayne? What l want to know is, where is the caveman? -Look. -He's gone. But that's impossible. -Not if he came to life, it isn't. -That does it. l'm calling the sheriff. -Got to get the sheriff. -Shaggy. Broken. Shaggy? Don't bother me now, Scoob. Hello, sheriff? Hello? Hello? This phone's busted. Why didn't you say something, Scoob? Oh, boy. There's something peculiar about this block of ice. . . . . . melting in the Arctic room. Maybe this heater explains why. lt's been turned on. But why would anyone want to bring that creep to life? l don't know, but we're gonna find out. Hey, look. Footprints. And, like, look at the size of them. Extra-large caveman. We're in luck. We can follow them right to him. Can't you, Scooby? -l can? -You heard the lady. Let's go. l've heard of holding someone's hand when they're scared. . . . . . but this is ridiculous. Look. The footprints end at the edge of the dock. And take a look who's out on the dock. Professor lngstrom. What's he doing with that strange equipment? This scene is getting creepier by the minute. ls he talking to the fish, or am l dreaming? You're not dreaming, l don't think. Scooby, sneak up closer and see if you can tell what he's up to. -Me? -Like, you're the only Scooby here. . . . . . thank goodness. So far, so good. Who's there? That must have been the wind. Scoob, look out for those pails! Scooby, are you all right? Professor lngstrom sure acted suspiciously. -l'll bet he's up to something. -And it's our job to find out what. Come on. Let's take a look in that shack. -lt's the caveman! -Let's get out of here! Faster, Velma! Faster! Zoinks. We're goners. Let's, like, find someplace to hide. -Boy, was that close. -Too close. Come on. We better see what happened to Shag and Scoob. Zoinks. Now you really got him mad. We've looked almost everywhere, but still no sign of Shaggy and Scooby. -l hope big-and-ugly didn't find them. -Not a chance. lf l know those two chickens. . . . . . they're miles away from the caveman by now. Zoinks! Well, like, l always wanted to take a spin around Oceanland. -Look. -We've landed on the tail of a whale. Still no sign of Shag and Scooby. Correction. Here they come! Help! And there they go. Like, help! Shaggy, Scooby, are you all right? Yeah, but now l know how a baseball feels. . . . . . when it's knocked out of the park. Me too. This whole mystery's got me puzzled. First Professor Wayne vanishes, then lngstrom disappears. . . . . . and finally, that frozen fright appears big as life. l bet lngstrom and his machine had something to do with it. Maybe this clue l found will give us some answers. -Like, what is it? -An ocean chart. And look. This line drawn from the spot marked X. . . . . . follows the current right to Oceanland. She's right. Our next step is to find out what's out there. You mean, like, you're going out there where X marks the spot? Wrong. You're going out there with Velma and Scooby. Daphne and l will try and find out what the caveman's up to. Shaggy, steer three degrees to starboard and then seven degrees to port. l'm nervous enough. Just simple ''turn left'' or ''turn right'' will do. We should just about be there. Keep a sharp lookout, Scooby. Look. Look. Dead ahead. A spooky old fishing boat. And it's anchored where the X is marked on the chart. lt seems to be deserted. This is our chance to search for clues. Oh, boy. With our luck, we'll probably find a ghost crew. Nothing in there. -A horrible creature? -Oh, Scooby, it's only me. Now, come inside, and let's look around. -What kind of clues are we looking for? -Anything unusual or mysterious. You mean, like doors slamming and locking behind us? What am l saying? lt did slam and did lock, and we're trapped. And that's not all. Look. An ice machine. And somebody turned it on full blast. Hey, wait a minute. This is a clue. The caveman was frozen in ice. We're gonna be next if we don't get out of here. We haven't much time. Somebody better think of something fast. Here's a Scooby Snack, Scoob. Think of something. -What's he doing with those ice tongs? -l don't know, but give him room. He's gonna build up speed and ram the door with the block of ice. Go, Scooby. Go. -Look out, Scoob! -Oh, no. He's losing control. That ice hit the keyhole so hard it was forced through in the shape of a key. -See if you can reach it, Scooby. -And, like, hurry. -Okay. -Hurry, Scooby. The ice is piling up. Hurry, Scoob. Hurry! Lucky that key worked. And just in time. Come on. Let's go back to Oceanland. . . -. . . and tell the others what we found. -l'm for that. Whoever locked us in the cabin wants to be double sure we don't get ashore. But don't worry. l've got a hot idea. -You call this a hot idea? -Keep paddling, Shaggy. -This is no time to get cold feet. -lt's not cold feet l'm worrying about. Well, we have pieces to this puzzle, but we don't know how they fit together. l figure the only way to figure out this mystery is to capture the caveman. l figured that's what she'd figure. Now, here's my plan, Shaggy. All you and Scooby have to do. . . . . . is find the caveman and let him chase you through that doorway. And when you do, we simply drop the net on him. Like, what safer way to sneak up on an old gruesome. . . . . . than disguised as a couple of fish? Zoinks. Hold it. There he is now. Okay, Scoob, do your stuff. Here goes. Bull's-eye! Feet-- l mean fins, let's go. -Zoinks. He's gaining on us. -Help! Help! l think l hear them coming. Daphne, don't lean over so far. -Help! -Help! -Hey, like, what happened? -Danger-prone Daphne did it again. Oh, no. Here comes trouble. Let's get out of here. Someone get me out of here! Hey, like, he can talk. Let's pull him out, Shag, and see who he really is. All together, pull. lt's Professor Wayne. You mean to say this whole caveman thing was a hoax? Not entirely, sheriff. The 2-million-year-old caveman lost at sea was for real. And that's what gave Professor Wayne the idea for his scheme. First he froze the dummy caveman in a block of ice out at the old fishing boat. He set it adrift, knowing it would float to Oceanland. Then he melted the ice with an electric heater and made it appear the caveman came to life and caused he and Ingstrom to vanish. Once lngstrom was out of the way, Wayne would return. . . . . . claiming to have escaped from the caveman. But why did he do it? l can answer that. He was after my invention. A revolutionary marine-life communicator. Like, wow. You mean you can talk to fish with it? Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo. That invention is worth a fortune. lt would have been mine if it weren't for those meddling kids. Well, where you're going. . . . . . you won't have to worry about meddling kids anymore. That wraps up this mystery. Let's head for the malt shop. What are we gonna do with old, tall, dark and dummy? Like, l got an idea. That was a clever idea you had, Shaggy. Yeah, like, Scoob needed a dance partner. . . . . . and he couldn't have gotten a better one. l gotta admit, Scoob has style. Yeah. He's all over the floor. SDl Media Group [ENGLlSH]
